Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Rendered to have a 4K display [Concept Video] 
Rumor: Samsung pretende lan??ar Galaxy Note 5 com tela 4K ainda este ano 
Verizon's Galaxy Note 5 to use Exynos 7420, 4GB of RAM 
AT&T Ships early just received my Note 5 Anyone else receive their note 5 today? I pre-ordered yesterday with AT&ampT and received my new Note 5 64GB this morning.  Setting it up now, but it looks great. Upgraded from a Note 3.  I'm disappointed there is no SD card or removable battery but its still worth it for me.  Curious what everyone first impressions are when they receive the phone if ordered. Also wanted to put it out there ATT not waiting until launch to ship. 
Official Power Bank with wireless charging capabilities? As shown down the page here: http://www.samsung.com/sec/galaxy/note5/accessories/Does anyone have any information on the specifics of this accessory? It sort of looks like it's a power bank that has wireless charging capabilites, but it also looks like it may even clip onto the phone (highly doubtful). 
5 Reasons To Buy The Samsung Galaxy Note 5 **This is a serious thread only. Read this, if you are willing to buy Note5**. I am not here to promote Note 5 product but listing some features that might get you interested into Samsung latest Note series.------**S-Pen:**sliding the S Pen out will automatically bring up a notes app so you can start scribbling straight away, which isn??t too dissimilar from Microsoft Surface Pro stylus and One Note combo. Pressure sensitivity and writing accuracy has also been improved. You can also write on screen while the screen is turned off.------**Specs:**Samsung??s new Note has been upgraded to the same 64-bit architecture found in the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge ??the Exynos 7420. Add to that 4GB of RAM and a less bloated TouchWiz, and you??ve got a speedy device. Samsung outclasses the rest of the Android competition in speed with its latest flagships.------**Design:**Just like the S6, it looks like the premium device that its high price-tag commands. The 5.7-inch display is slightly smaller than last year??s version, but the Note 5 still sits comfortably in the phablet zone. Moreover, It also has Samsung??s trademark Super AMOLED quad-HD (2k) display, which is still one of the best screens on the market.------**Top-end camera:**One of the two most important features in a smartphone to consumers (the other being batterylife). Samsung??s recent camera efforts have been nothing short of stellar. The Note 4 took the 2014 top spot, as did the S6 and S6 Edge. The Note 5 has the same 16MP camera in the aforementioned flagship handsets, which means the same speed, quality and detail that the S6 and S6 Edge produce. With the Note 5??s camera, you can take pictures quickly with its fast autofocus and shutter speed (less than a second), record 4K footage and filter your face beyond recognition with Samsung??s many editing options. There??s also the Note??s impressive low-light performance, which again outperforms its rivals.------**Samsung Pay:**Are you a lazy fool who hates carrying around a wallet full of MasterCard? Well, now you can virtually pay with your virtual MasterCard using Galaxy Note 5.If you are here for a new phone, great and premium looking design with compelling specs, Note 5 will not disappoint at the current market level.
5 Reasons Not To Buy The Samsung Galaxy Note 5 **This is a serious thread only. Read this, if you are not willing to buy Note5**. This thread is not meant to be a hate-thread, i am just listing some big features that are removed from Note 5.------**MicroSD:**There are no SD-Card slot. There were rumors about the Chinese, Korean market having an SD-card slot but nothing was announced. Even if it is announced, don't expect them to work with NA LTE.------**Battery:**2k screen with a super screen size phone, but with only 3k battery size? Not to mention, it is a non-removable battery.------**Space:**There is no SD-Card support which is already a con. Now there are no model for 128GB storage! [Source](https://twitter.com/dcseifert/status/632180891197042688). Samsung website also removed the 128GB option for Edge+ and Note 5. Not to mention, all the software with TouchWiz will probably take up 20GB of space :(------**IR blaster:**While Note 5 is missing many feature, i am also sad that this is getting removed too. I don't know why but with me having an S5 (not everday phone), i use my S5 often to control my TV sometimes (my S5 is linked with my (PVR + TV).------**Price:**32GB for a base model starting at $70(which is okayish for new phone), I live in Canada so i am expecting around $800+ for base model. But for such price, there are other flag-ship phones that offer more features than Note 5 (*cough*/ Galaxy Note 4) or you can go with the cheaper alternative design like Galaxy S6 or edge.------Galaxy Note series is supposed to be the most premium and superior phone out of all. Each Note supposed to suppress the previous design. While Note 5 have some good features and design, i don't think it is enough to purchase Note 5 with such price and I am much happier with my Note 4.If you are type of person who would likes to purchase new phone with premium design, new feature (check other sticky thread) and OP specs, then this is the phone for you. If you like space, battery life then this isn't the phone for you. While Note 5 does have much efficient TouchWiz that will extend the battery life, the lack of non-removable battery looses many people interest.
I cant watch youtube 60fps on my note 5, why? 
Note5 fingerprint scanner learn over time? I would like to know if the fingerprint scanner on the note5 is capable of 'learning' one's fingerprint better over time, like Apple does, to gradually improve accuracy.
Charger compatibility I just got a Surface 3 today, and my Note 5 cable stopped working. Both of them use a micro-USB port. I was wondering if I can use my Surface 3 charger with my Note 5 and not damage the Note 5's battery.Here are the specs:Surface 3 charger:* Input: 100-240V ~ 0.3A, 50/6Hz* Output: 5.2V = 2.5ANote 5 charger:* Input: 100-240V ~ 0.5A, 50/6Hz* Output: 9.0V = 1.67A or 5.0V = 2.0AOr do I need to go out and buy another OEM charger for my Note 5?

Screen off notes do not sync with evernote. Any other app usefulness? If I take a note on the screen off, I want it to get on my homescreen somehow.Other action notes sync immediately with evernote which goes on my widget on the home screen.Any ideas or other apps that work well with it?
A question about Slow Mo on the Note 5. Hello everyone, I am currently in the process of deciding what phone to upgrade to. It is between the new Note 5 and the IPhone 6S in about a month, or whenever it comes out. I am currently using a 5C (boo) and sometimes an S4, so I know my way around both OS systems. One of the deciding points (as trivial as it may seem to some) is the slow mo function. I was wondering if anyone knew what the fps is on the Samsung Note 5 Slow Mo function. From what I've seen, the apple devices seem to be superior in that area. I wanted to know if the Note 5 is comparable. edit: grammar
Samsung Galaxy Note 5: New Leak From Sprint??s Website Reveals Full Specifications 
New flairs and better UI for usability Hi,Since the Note 5 has been released, I made new flairs for better usability. The flairs include:**Red** - [Help]**Green** - [Discussion]**Blue** - [News]**Purple** - [Media]**Orange** - [Meta] &lt- Users can write custom flair for the META posts (ie: Bug, AMA etc)Of-course putting flairs into your link post is optional. We will eventually do it for you. But for the sake of future, after you submit a link, it will automatically get flared (Working on the CSS).We are also working on making this sub-Reddit look more Minimalist and fresh. Few days ago we released users flair and we realized how messy the screen becomes. We will minimize this feature and while we work on the newer CSS for this sub-reddit (Modified version of the Minimaluminiumalism Theme), each posts will get transparent colored Line before the Thumbnail (ie: Bug will get a very light orange light before thumbnail).
PSA - Make sure you don't stick the SPen in top-first it will get stuck I came across a Note5 at a carrier store and the tip of the pen was sticking out about a quarter inch (the tip, not the end). You can't get it back out that way. You can still click it, but you can't remove it. The store employees said they had put in a call to Samsung, and that it was a flaw in the design (maybe it has to do with the clicking mechanism?).Not that any of us would be stupid enough to put in the SPen upside down, but make sure if someone else is playing with your phone (a child, friend, your local idiot, etc.) that they don't put the SPen in bottom-first.
Day one with Note 5, worried about heat Just got my Note 5 delivered today, and during initial setup it got quite hot. I know that phones get warm while setting up and downloading a ton of apps and settings, but it worried me, and in general this CPU runs hotter than I'm used to seeing. Upper 50s celcius usually, not charging, not in setup, just normal. Granted I'm still on day one. I returned my Nexus 6 because it got uncomfortably hot and signed on to AT&ampT's Next plan/indentured servitude so I could get this. Heat was my big problem with the Nexus, and it'd really be aggravating for it to be a problem with this too. Anyone else having any issues? Am I nuts? I'm willing to believe I'm nuts. Thanks, all.
Galaxy Note 5 to Get 6in 4K AMOLED Display with 700+ppi, Says Samsung's Leaked Roadmap 
Ordering at the Store - Early Release? I was in a store earlier this week and they confirmed the Friday release. What are the chances they surprise us and make them available early? They have to have them at least a day before - Let's use this to track any rumors of an early release at the actual stores.
Battery Life Here is what I got yesterday.  I plugged in at 15%, so not sure how it would have done with a total drain.  Pretty heavy use day for me, and I was pleased with what I got.Overnight only dropped 4% from 89% to 85%....  pretty good for standby compared to some other android phones I've had.

Yellowish screen? I just received my note 5 and the whites look more yellowish than normal. Is it supposed to be that way? It's also my first amoled screen and im coming from the G3 which had cooler whites *more blue* so i'm not really sure if its an issue with the screen or if i'm not used to amoled screens...
Took the plunge and pre-ordered mine from sprint. Upgrading from the lgg3. I love the new digitizer, and my battery life sucks on the g3, no matter the rom/kernel combo I tried. I'm always near outlets and with fast charging I think I'll be ok. I just want 4-5 hours of sot.Anyone else take the plunge?

New Note 5 owner needs help setting up. Just switched over from an iPhone 6. I loved the iPhone but I just wanted to mix things up with my t-mobile jump upgrade. I need help setting up a few things. So my primary concern is battery life. I know android is a lot more finicky and unstable when it comes to battery life. Can someone tell me what sort of settings I can apply to be sure there isn't some background service or unnecessary process or app that chugs battery life? I'm not looking to cripple my user experience. I just want this phone to have at least as good battery life as my iPhone 6 did which was able to get me through my 9 to 5 job with 50% minimum left by the time I got home. Another thing is that for some reason the phone doesn't recognize my chrome casts. I'm on the same WiFi and I can't get it to find them. Also, all my friends are on imessage. I was sure to disable imessage and FaceTime before trading in my phone. I also went to the Apple deregister site which said I was already unregistered. My girlfriend said she was sending me texts and I still was not receiving them. I want to be sure I have it set up so that I get all texts. I also want to make sure my group sms is fine and not responding to group texts by creating separate individual threads with each of the participants on their respective phones. Any other tips and tricks would greatly be appreciated. Thanks.
Bunch of nice photos of the Note 5 - no IR blaster 
Note 5 or S6 Edge+? My contract finally ended and now i'm finally able to upgrade to a new phone but I am having a very tough debate to either obtain the Note 5 or S6 Edge+. The only Samsung device I've ever bought was the S3 and I've moved to Sony and Nexus after that. So what are your opinions on which one I should get? P.S. I have no experience with any Note devices :)
Note 5 or S6? I'm upgrading from this phone that I should've upgraded from a long time ago... But I waited to pick between the two giants of Samsung. My current phone is only 4.1 and a bigger screen would do good for me. A little background, I use my phone mainly for watching YouTube videos, using maps (I drive everyday), checking social media, and read blogs, books, and comics. But my only worry is putting it in my pocket and the huge adjustment if I get the Note 5, is the huge change worth it? P.S. I plan to keep this phone for at most 5 years (If it doesn't break). Spec-wise, both Note 5 and S6 are beastly already.

[Question] Will the Note 5 N920I Model support UK Bands for GSM/3G/4G? I'm thinking of importing a Note 5, Model N920I via eBay from Hong Kong, and whilst I've checked that its compatible with the 4G bands used by all UK Networks, is it likely to be GSM and 3G compatible? Can anyone else foresee any other issues I'd have using this handset? Also, what's your faviroute colour? That blue looks pretty sweet, but I'm not sure. Thanks!
Anyone's phone screen getting scratched easily? I got one on release day and babied it (no case) and it developed a very small scratch.Received a new phone, they were out of cases, babied the shit out of it, and it has two bigger scratches.  Both under 24 hours.... I've never had this problem with any phone before.This happening to anyone else?  Is everyone buying screen guards?
742being eclipsed? I'm interested in buying the N5/S6 Edge Plus, and while it currently has the best processor on the market, it is somewhat old at this point. Will it be eclipsed soon? If so will it be a significant upgrade? Thanks!
Forced default apps When opening something from one app into another it asks what app I want to use like normal but there's no just once option. It forces me to choose a default app.Sometimes I want to open the same kind of links in different apps for different reasons and don't want to set a default. Is there a way to do this on the Note 5?Also, is this behavior a functionality of the launcher (touchwiz)? I've never used a different launcher before so I don't know if that's part of what a launcher does or not.
Cell Standby Battery Drain, I'ts Killing My Battery I've had the Verizon Note 5 for a few days now and have terrible battery life.  The issues seems to be Cell standby It's gobbling up all my battery.Look here  http://imgur.com/O55bs9I21% seems a little high seeing that screen is only 5%.  Screen on time http://imgur.com/53RkYia  1:56Is anyone else experiencing a similar issue?  
Does the Note5 have stereo speakers or mono? Looked for this everywhere but still can't find an answer. 
I can live without the SD card slot, but not without an extended battery. Do you think the Note 5 battery can be replaced with a bigger capacity one? I mean replacing the battery altogether, and not an add-on battery case that plugs into the micro USB port. Just wonder if you guys think it's possible?

S-Pen Broke after putting pen in the correct way Somehow it broke in half (clean break. looks like the halves were glued together) and now the tip is inside the socket and i have the spring and clicker. Any ideas on how to get this thing out?
100% Battery How long after unplugging from a full charge does your phone stay on 100%?  Seems like mine almost immediately drops to 99%.  Battery has been fine, but seems to have gotten worse now.  I have taken all the usual steps to keep drain at bay.  When my phone isn't in use at all the battery is a champ and barely drops any power.  Any use at all though starts to tick away at the battery quickly.  All I really do is look at Reddit is fun and text messages. 
Ram Management My note 5 is constantly running with like 75% ram used. I can't get this down  whenever I clear it it just shoots back up. I already disabled as much as I could. T-mobile my account is not able to be removed. Is there anyway to get this down?

Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Release Date Indirectly Confirmed By Samsung Pay Roll Out Date? 
As someone with a Note 4, I'm so conflicted about the 5. I LOVE the Note 4, it's hands down the best phone I've ever owned. I love how you can swap the battery to keep going all day, I love the spen, I love the size and the feel in hand, I love the multitasking. Despite being a huge fan of stock android I can even put up with all of the touchwiz shit because of how good the rest of the phone is. I was convinced that I'd never own another phone that wasn't a Note again.And then I saw the Note 5 and it all went out the window because of no removable battery! No, I thought, how could they?...And then I saw [this pocketnow video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtafrmU4ZMo) where they go over some of the new software features and I'm seriously doubting my earlier dismissal!Writing on the screen when it's off? AWESOME.Select an entire page in screengrabs? REALLY AWESOMEAnnotate PDFs directly? WTF SO SO AWESOME THIS WILL SAVE ME SEVERAL HOURS A DAY AT WORK.Live streaming directly from the camera app? AWESO.. I.. uh.. I don't actually have a use case for that one personally but it's still GREAT.Everything about this phone seems like a massive improvement other than the shitty SHITTY battery. I don't want to have to go back to carrying a charger with me all day! I go on long trips, I need that 8-1hours SOT that you can only get with removable batteries!I'm just so confused right now _ why couldn't you just be perfect instead of having a huge ass compromise?tldr this phone looks amazing apart from the elephant in the back cover... but despite all that perhaps we shouldn't be so quick to write it off?

SideSync Won't Install on Win 1I downloaded the SideSync software from the Samsung site, and must've gone through the installation 1times now, multiple reboots and attempted troubleshooting with no luck. I'm able to open the installer which prompts for administrative rights, i click Yes, and then it lets me get to the destination choice, and as soon as I click Install the installer disappears and nothing happens. Has anyone had this issue or know what's causing it? Driving me nuts. Is this a Windows 1not being supported yet thing?**Solved (for me)** Thank you PDXMatthew - https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxynote5/comments/3ip2rd/sidesync_wont_install_on_win_10/cuik4u2
Poor battery life. How do I improve? So I came to the note 5 from my iPhone 6 (not 6plus) and so far it's a fun experience. I've been on android before but this is the best experience I've had so far since the software is finally quick and consistent and has far fewer stuttering than before but there is still one nagging issue that remains which is poor battery life. Yesterday was my first full day with the note 5 and it was shocking how fast the battery drains on this phone especially when compared to the iPhone 6. For instance, my normal morning commute involves about an hour or so of podcast listening to downloaded episodes. I don't use the screen much at all. By the time I arrived at work, my iPhone would almost always be still at 100%. The note 5 on the other hand was down to 94%.My day continues with some light texting at work and about 45 min to an hour of video streaming through netflix or Hulu etc on lunch. By 5pm my iPhone always had around 60% charge. Maybe it would dip into high 50s if I used it harder but never below 55% before 5pm. The note 5 yesterday was dropping to 60-55% by 2:30. It seems that the note is at least 10% - 15% worse on the battery so far. Even on the two times I've left the phone at 100% overnight the next morning the phone is at 95% without me touching it. IPhone could stay at 100% all day if I don't use it.Any time I actually use the phone whether it be to text or check a quick feed, I can literally watch the battery life tick down almost as if I have to pay 1% for every single action I do with the phone. I never noticed with my iPhone. I just feel a lot less confident with this battery and really would love to improve it to at least get it close to where the iPhone 6 was. The one saving grace is the quick charger which is shockingly fast to recharge. I love that feature but I don't want to bring the charger to and from work or have to buy a second one. I don't have to worry about getting to an outlet. I NEVER worried with the iPhone. It always made it to bedtime no matter what. Please help me right the ship here. So far I've been running the brightness at around 25-30% as always. Sync is turned off as I do this manually.

Keyboard cover popup Is anyone else having this issue: when I'm watching a video on YouTube, and I turn the phone to landscape, a message pops up saying that themes don't work with the keyboard cover (which I don't have, obviously) - and it deletes my material theme and turns me back to the stock theme. It also cancels my video. What the hell? 
Is there a plastic sticker over the camera lense? So when I first got the phone there was only a visable plastic sticker over the heartrate monitor and I can't tell if there's one over the camera lense or not. Can anyone confirm if there's actually one?

My battery life on day 1 
Still getting six hours of screen on time. http://i.imgur.com/wXbhnKB.jpg - that's 8/21/15Here was 8/20/15 - http://i.imgur.com/YdgHdFg.jpgSo yeah,  I'm thinking 6 hours screen on time per charge is confirmed.   The battery optimization of the hardware on this device is excellent. Many of the professional reviews are confirming good battery life so this shouldn't be a surprise,  but the large amount of hate for the battery online before release had me super curious what the battery could do. 
IR Blaster? Why would samsung remove this feature?  the various leaks and rumors make it sound like its gone.  I find this surprising, since a lot of people rely on their smartphone to run their TV for chromecasting, etc.  It's also a real game changer if you are in an area where you don't have access to the TV remote, like the waiting room of a doctor's office, the DMV, or something like that.Very surprising to me.
Need a cheap phone to trade in at best buy, any suggestions? I bought my 64g Note 5 yesterday. I have a 64g s6 I am selling. They said I can still bring a phone back in with the receipt for a gift card for the $200. Any suggestions?Thanks
Would anyone care to compile a comprehensive and detailed list of apps we can safely disable? An easy list is just anything carrier related and anything samsung related that you don't use - but sometimes it's a little tricky, disabling some apps can apparently slow down other apps in unexpected ways and maybe even drain battery faster. Because of this, I've always been hesitant to disable any apps. But I suspect we might get some advantage in terms of free RAM for the notorious multi-tasking limitation.
These battery stats seem bad. What can I do? http://s2.postimg.org/nns2lz909/Screenshot_2015_08_22_18_56_10.pngMy phone was fully charged for the first time last night (phone off).  I unplugged it and turned it on.  I've got auto brightness set.  Wifi, data and sync on and that's it.  Most bloatware disabled.  I've got lots of other bells and whistles off too.  All I've done so far is browse the net and check some settings.  So far the battery seems horrible for me.  Any ideas? 
Anyone figured out how to remove the Brightness slider yet? From the notification menu? Just wondering. If there is already a post about this please direct me to it. I searched and cannot find one.
What do you guys think about this case? It is between this one and the Spigen Neo Hybrid 
Uneven backlight? Hey everyone,Got my gn5 yesterday and really liking the phone so far - and the screen, which is great - except for one thing - the back light feels uneven across the screen. This is especially evident with darker colors (but not black obviously). If I set the whole screen to the same color, the bottom right seems to be lighter than the top left. I tried to take a picture, but it's pretty tricky to capture: http://imgur.com/be1lgjdAny of your guys' Note 5s looking like that?Thanks.

Based on what we know now, would you rather get a Note 5 or an S6? I'm debating between these two, and I'd love to hear other people's opinions. I'm waiting to get an S6 to see what the Note 5 looks like.I am excited to also get a Samsung VR, which has a model for the S6 and the Note 4. I assume that also means there will be one for the Note 5.Battery life is a big deal for me, because I'll be tethering a lot and expect that to be a power drain. Will have to wait to get exact tests on which lives longer...Size is not too much of an issue for me. I like the bigger Note formfactor, but the S6 is big enough.Price might be a selling point. Since the S6 has been out for a bit, maybe there'll be some kind of deal in August/September that makes it notably cheaper than the Note 5? I'm on T-Mobile so would be buying this full price.Anyone out there right now have an S6 and is regreting it/considering switching? How about people like me who want an S6 but waiting to see if the Note 5 is cooler/better?

recent apps and backarrow key always blinking? they blink every 45-6seconds constantly when i have the screen on....how do i stop this ???
Help: contextual menu, how to access it? Got my note 5 earlier today. While reinstalling my apps,  one of them required to access the contextual menu, which is usually located in the lower left if the device  (at least on my S4).On the note 5, this pops the application switcher.  A long press will open the multi-window mode.I tried doing long presses on other buttons but none popped the contextual menu. Any ideas? Thanks
S Note Transform into text/formula, WHERE IS IT?? I feel like I'm losing my mind here.  How do I select handwritten text and convert it to typed text?  I'm sitting here looking at my galaxy note tab 10.1, which has this feature.  My friend's note 4 has the transform into feature.  In the note 5, you can choose selection mode, it highlights the text perfectly, yet there is no option to transform it?  Am I missing something here, or did they really remove this? this is one of the main reasons I went with the note.Edit - As Cmonayy points out, if you open S Note, on the start screen, select More, then More Features.   Download the extension packs. Why they shipped this app gimped is beyond me.
Is it possible to have notifications wake the screen? I like being able to quick view my notifications without having to unlock the phone if it is on my desk next to me. Would be nice to be able to have the screen wake when it gets a notification.
Screen Mirroring Options? How can I mirror my Note 5 to my TV? I want to play games and watch movies. I would prefer a direct connection (HDMI), but something like a Chromecast would be okay too. Sidesync crashes on my pc, so thats out of the question for now. (unless someone has a fix!) Thanks!
Android system destroying battery? I got the Verizon Note5 on saturday, and Android system is having a really big impact on my battery. My phone would only last around 2hours on standby. Today it has used 30% of my battery. Are there any fixes for this?
Anyone have a dock that works? Looking for a good dock that will work well with a case. Using this case :http://www.amazon.com/dp/B010MWIG1K/ref=twister_B010MWHU7Q?_encoding=UTF8&amppsc=1
Lens over heart rate sensor scratched? I've had my Note 5 for about a week now.  I never actually got around to closely inspecting the phone until this evening.  After carefully removing the plastic from the lens over the heart rate sensor I discovered a scratch/crack.  It's very small and is right between the LED and the first sensor.  I don't think it effects performance at all, but I'm not sure if it'll get worse.  I've still got time to get a replacement from VZ if need be.  Thoughts? 
Note 4 or Note 5? (Not a comparison, genuine suggestions) I'm looking to upgrade my phone and am not sure whether to buy a Note 4 or Note 5 after the new unveiling. I played with the devices at Best Buy, the Note 5 is definitely aesthetically nice but I am worried about it being too fragile. Also, in some weird way I liked the Note 4's faux leather better, but the sloped back on the 5 was nice.Also, the recent news about the Note 5 not having GearVR software is a let down to me because I wanted to try the GearVR, but I didn't want to get the 4 since it's a year old, but if the 5 doesn't get GearVR support then that's a major disappointment.Note too worried about the replaceable batteries or SD card. They're nice features, but not deal breakers for me.Just note sure whether to go ahead and get the Note 5 and hope for GearVR support or get the Note 4 even though it's a slower processor and less RAM and less future proof.
Samsung Announces Galaxy Note 5 and S6 Edge Plus 
Import Note 5 to UK It does suck that the Note 5 is not coming to Europe / UK.I don't understand why they aren't even doing a limited release with no marketing etc for people who do want to buy it outright. That way they would keep some people happy, but by not releasing it to all the networks they would not be creating conflict with S6 Edge+. (which I assume is what they are avoiding).I normally buy my phone outright and use a sim only contract.I've never bought a phone from outside the UK before. I want an UNLOCKED 64GB Titanium Silver Note 5.I am thinking in a month or so the Silver will become available in US? Complete guess.I have a relative in New York who would purchase it for me, and I can just transfer  them the money. What are the tax implications of them sending it to me in the post? Is this my best option? I'm completely in the dark!I also have a friend in Kuala Lumpur Indonesia who do the same.I am reluctant to purchase via ebay, in fear of getting a fake one etc from China.Appreciate any advice. Please no advice re not getting the Note 5 / bashing the Note 5!Although a small part of me is intrigued by the LG G4 Pro, and maybe Sony Z5...
New S Pen Mini-Review: Why is this Stylus Better, and Why Should You Care ? 
Question about app switching I am interested in pickup up a Note 5 tomorrow (t-mobile, to be specific), but i've seen a lot of complaints online about it's aggressive app killing which causes every app to reload if you switch out and back in. Is this a real issue, or is this something people complain about because they have an opinion and internet access?
I have an extra Note5 Pre-registered Email [free year of Netflix] I have two pre-registered emails for the T-Mobile promotion. For anyone interested who has a spare tmobile Note5 IMEI, I'll trade you one (that way, we can both cash in). 
Any audiophiles care to comment on audio quality? Seriously considering this phone but I use my phone to listen to music a lot, HTC One M7 currently. How's the audio on the Note 5? UM Pro 3headphones is what I have.

Importing from taiwan the note 5? I live in europe and had decided to buy the note 4 a couple months back but waited for the note 5. When i heard that the note 5 wouldn't be available in europe i was quite disappointed. But i saw that it qas available to buy on ebay from places like taiwan. Because i am quite new to this, apart from the price of the device what else would i pay? And especcialy do you think that it is safe for things like the warranty and scams? And is it compatible witj european networks?
Slow charging. Will any charger work? I've been reading that it may be beneficial to charge using slow charge sometimes rather than fast charge all the time.  With that in mind, will my old S4 charger work?
OTG Cable With all the changes with the newest note, does anyone know if they work with OTG cables?

Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Dropped. Here??s What Happened Next - Drop test performed on this handset! 
Sprint Note 5 comes with free extra headphones? I just upgraded my iPhone5 to a Note 5 and at the sprint store the agent told me that there was a free pair of over the ear headphones included with the upgrade.  When I looked at the receipt it showed $25for the 32gb phone and $99 for the over-ear headphones.  Can anyone verify if this is legit or did I get scammed out of an extra $100? 
YouTube app doesn't play 60fps videos My youtube app on my Galaxy Note 5 doesn't play 60fps videos in 60fps. It does, however, play 1440p videos, and they look fantastic! Is this a common issue with newly released devices? Is there a workaround in the meantime?
Ad pop-ups Has anyone had issues with random ad pop-ups coming up that redirects to the play store? It happens at random like when opening the phone application or going into settings. I'm on the t-mobile variant. Thanks for any info.
Anybody try the live broadcast feature? I can't get mine to work. Just messing around with all the new stuff, but I can't seem to get this working.  I've followed the directions on [this website](http://9to5google.com/2015/08/21/how-to-fix-galaxy-note-5-s6-edge-youtube-live-streaming-already-enabled-error/), but at the end, where it tells you to add the account, I just get kicked back out and am forced to sign in with my Gmail credentials.  I'm lost...
Context menu button instead of open apps? I've just switched to the Note 5 from the Note 3. On the N3,  I had my left touch button set to bring up the context menu for whatever app. I honestly don't remember if this was default behavior or something buried in the settings. Is there a way to get this functionality back?
Edge+ vs. Note 5 screens. There is a noticeable difference in quality between the S6 Edge+ and the Note 5. While the panels have the same specs on paper, their real-life effect is quite large. The Edge+ has a faint blurry grain to any flat colors and a barely noticeable fuzz to what should be crisp lines. The viewing angles are also pretty bad, especially on the curved edges, which distorts the colors along the sides of the screen. Hold one next to a Note 5, look really close, and you'll see what I mean. I ended up trading mine in for a Note 5. I compared several other Edge+ handsets, and they all exhibited the same lack of quality. Very disappointing.
S Pen upside down? Does it matter which way you stick the pen in? I mean does it matter whether or not the Samsung logo is facing down when you insert the pen? I noticed that today I happened to stick the pen in logo facing down instead of up. Kind of freaked me out! Anyone have an answer to this?
S-Pen lasso and copy text gone? EDIT: It's still there. Just hold the S-Pen button while selecting the text. A copy dialogue appears. (thanks 3rd and Dong lol)On the Note 4, if there was text on the screen (i.e. a phone number) and you wanted to copy it, you could use the S-Pen if tapping and holding with your finger didn't work.I just tried it with a phone # (wanted to copy from a classified listing and paste into Hangouts to text the person). I lasso'd the text and don't see a copy function. This was definitely on the Note 4.Am I doing it wrong or did Samsung remove this highly useful feature? (to comply with copyright demands?)
Deals/discounts for note5? Does Reddit know of any other deals going on whether in store or online around the internet? Looking for Note 5 on T-mobile, preferrably 64gb version, but willing to settle for 32gb if a deal is decent enough.I'm aware of costco's cash card deal and best buys deal, but BB doesn't have tmobile phones apparently, and Costco seems to only work for 32gb, which none of the stores near me seem to have stock left. Hoping to find something similar or better before the deal expires, and hoping maybe theres something I havent found. As much as this phone costs, I want to at least feel like im getting some sort of deal out of the insane purchase price. :P
Is the free year of premium Evernote for us too? The note 4 had this offer, just wondering if anyone has gotten it on the 5.
Samsung test drive - impressed by battery First full day after depleting down to and then up to full charge for actual usage. Received the phone early yesterday and I've been on it since. This is my first Android phone but I guess you could say I know a few things about optimizing performance from frequently visiting android forums. Anyways I thought 6 hours SOT was impressive.  Quite honestly whenever I visited the android subs,  I got the impression that battery life sucked across the board for like... All users. 
How to Record 4k videos on Samsung Note 5 More than 5 Minutes 
I keep getting phantom notifications Literally once a minute my phone vibrates and chimes, but nothing has come up on the top bar of the screen. I bought it at 10am and it started this nonsense last night at 4am and I couldn't get back to sleep. Can someone help me out please?

Random audio crackling/spiking I've noticed the audio playback on my new Note 5 is not quite what I'd expect out of a ~$70device. Every so often (can be anywhere between a few seconds to a few minutes), the audio will spike, almost like what you'd hear on a scratched up CD. Sometimes it's subtle, other times it can be pretty loud. If I go back and play the same song again, it doesn't play the same spike at the same parts of the song. The issue is still present even if I have headphones or speakers plugged into the audio jack.Is anyone else experiencing the same issue? I've tested numerous audio playback apps and songs, and the only thing I've noticed is that the issue seems to only be present with .mp3 files with a variable bitrate (which is a good chunk of my library, because I usually downsample from 320/lossless), though I haven't tested it quite enough to be 100% sure of that.I've honestly got no idea whether this is a hardware or software issue. Or perhaps a little of both. EDIT: Ok, I'm pretty sure it's exclusively mp3s with variable bitrate, as I've been testing it with various songs and the only ones that have the issue are mp3 vfiles. I've also tested audio playback on two other Samsung phones: an S3 and an S5, and neither of them have any apparent issues with audio playback, variable or constant.To any other Note 5 owners, I would really appreciate it if somebody could test it out for themselves to see if they have the same issue. I'm not sure whether it's a hardware issue with my phone, or something that's affecting all Note 5's.

Can you remove the S finder / Quick Connect from the notification panel? The S finder / Quick Connect buttons were present on the S6 edge notification panel but a recent update (5.1.1?) has made them easy to remove without root via the EDIT button up the top (I think - I haven't received the update yet). For those who have the Note 5 already, does it have the function to remove it already?Thanks!

PMA Charging? I am hopefully picking up a Note 5 tomorrow, I just returned my S6 Edge to get it. Along time ago I got the duracell PMA wireless charger for dirt cheap, I have used it with Galaxy s6 and my edge recently, its a pain in the butt to charge with but I leave it in the office and it works ok. I cant find anywhere in the specs if the Note 5 will support PMA like the s6 and the s6 edge does. Anyone know?

Oh these bastards - rumor of Note 5 Active with bigger battery coming out in November http://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-5-active-rumored-for-november/&gt The tougher Galaxy Note 5 Active would allegedly equipped with a waterproof rating and larger battery (4,100mAh over 3,000mAh), according to tech site Phone Arena, which also suggested that the 5.7-inch jumbo phone would arrive in early November, in time for the bustling holiday shopping season.http://www.phonearena.com/news/That-4100-mAh-Note5-battery-It-may-be-in-a-Note5-Active-coming-in-November_id72890
Why doesn't the Note 5 have USB - C? Lots of rumors before the release indicated it would. If it did, i would have traded off the non removable battery for USB- c Anyone have any conjecture as to why it ended up not getting it, or maybe there will be a re-released version that does?as it is, i think i'll replace the battery in my Note 3 and continue using it until we get USB c in a note. 
So, got an email from Best Buy today saying my 64gb Note 5 is backordered. Has this happened to anyone else? It's not available to pick up at the store near me but one that is an hour and a half away.  So I picked to ship it to me,  which made it take an extra week and now it's saying it's backordered.  Wonder when I can expect it.  And first time pre-ordering a phone from Best Buy.  My luck.

Removing/hiding the default battery icon from the status bar? Hi fellow Note 5 users.  Have a quick question and google is still failing me.  I use the Battery Doctor app, which comes with a battery indicator for the status bar.  This, of course, renders the default battery icon redundant.  I've tried looking in settings (Display/Notifications/etc) to see if there's a place to turn off the indicator, however, I haven't had any luck.Is there a way to disable or hide the default indicator?  
Slow wifi Anyone having issues with the WiFi speeds on their note 5? Mine is considerably slower on WiFi than lte, almost 3g slow. I've tried clearing the cache on my phone forgetting the network and resetting the router. Any other ideas how to fix this?
Will root simply be impossible on ATT and Verizon versions? I want to upgrade but from the looks of it, ATT and Verizon phones are screwed when it comes to root.

Samsung Galaxy Note 5 And S6 Edge Plus: Samsung Confirms Aug.13 Launch, Global Release Expected Following Week 
I am so pissed. So, I have Note 3. A wonderful phone that came with 2 year Verizon contract. I had all the intentions to get the Note 5 when my contract was for a renewal. Now, no SD Card is the feature that hurts the most. I have music, etc, on my sd card and I don't check space before downloading apps. I am not getting a phone where I'll be watching every megabyte. No removable battery is also a pain. 2 years with a same phone, no battery can stay fresh for 2 years, I changed 3 batteries during almost 2 years so a phone can hold charge for about 24+ hours and not shut down within 1hours like it does when a battery becomes old. Plus, it seems, to keep the size to a minimum, the battery that is included holds less charge...How the fuck is it different from an iPhone? I am so pissed. Now I have to look for ANOTHER phone. 100% I'll be not picking up this castrated model.
Can we please stop the anti note 5 circle jerk?! OK, so you're not happy about non-removable battery and no SD slot. Go read/watch some reviews on other phones and and hit up their sub-reddits. Some people are actually excited about the positive changes that have been made to the Note 5 and it would be nice to have a forum to discuss this device without the constant negative posts and down voting of any praise post. It's just a freaking phone people.
Note5 colors What color is everyone getting for the note 5? The white pearl or black sapphire?  I am leaning towards the white sapphire because it stands out more and the black is mostly blueish.
No Silver Titanium on Verizon? Is that color carrier specific?  Thanks.
The Big Question: Is it the Note 5 or the Note5? Samsung's official page refers to it without the space, it's the Galaxy Note5, despite the space between Note and digit in the past. But very few folks, if any, are writing it this way. MUSN'T WE ALL COME TOGETHER ON THIS?

Netflix Multi-Window no longer works (did on Note 4)? Why did Netflix stop supporting split screen viewing? It worked on the Note 4, albeit janky (had to play, then pause, then go into multi-window, select another app, then Netflix again, otherwise the stream would pause). At least it worked on the 4. The Note 5 straight up doesn't work. Am I missing something?
Battery life not that great? About 50% depleted and I only have 2.5 hours of SOT, which equates to about 5 hours (versus the 7 hours many others were reporting).

DPI setting too high Got the note 5 and feel the DPI setting is too high.

[NOTE 5] How to use Home button to unlock, rather then Swipe screen?

Samsung Wireless Charger randomly stops charging with Galaxy Note 5. I'll place the Note 5 on the charger... light goes blue... and either a few seconds or a few minutes later... the screen will light up and say 'Wireless Charging Paused' and the light will flash blue.The phone is placed exactly where it should be.  It's very, very random when it stops.  Sometimes it'll charge a while before doing it, other times it'll immediately stop.Is this a fault of the phone, or the charger?  Which route should I be taking for replacement?
No need to leave NFC on with Samsung pay, it automatically toggles NFC for you. [xpost /r/android] This feature should be good for battery life and for those of us who don't want to be toggling it when we are going to make a payment.

I tested it by turning off NFC and making an NFC payment at Walgreens, the payment went through with no problem and afterward NFC was still disabled.

Glass Screen Protectors: Has anybody had any luck finding one that works for your Note 5? I just got my Note 5 yesterday and I do not want to use it until I get a case and screen protector.  I have looked at reviews for just about every glass protector on Amazon and they all seem to have major issues (halo, being too small, not fitting correctly, breaking after a few days, etc).  Does anyone have a solid recommendation for a glass screen protector?  Alternatively, if all the glass ones suck, will a plastic protector work with the s-pen and, if so, which one(s) do you recommend?

Galaxy Note 5 Stylus Fail: MacBreak Weekly 469 
Bezels Be Damned One of the biggest selling points for me on this phone was its looks, and that was due in large to the tiny bezels, truly making it an edge to edge screen. But in my hunt for a nice slim case, I'm finding the lack of bezels to be an issue! Due to the slight overhang on the front of the device from the cases, swiping in from the side is damn near impossible. So far I have used the super basic Insignia (best buy house brand) and the Spigen SlimFit. Anyone else running into this? Anyone have a very slim case that doesn't interfere, pretty much has to have very little lip on the front of the device.

anyone get the best buy deal (20off and the charger) while buying the phone outright? I went to 1 location Thursday to preorder and they said I had to activate it or get a new line.  I called 3 other stores this morning and they all said the same thing.  Why cant you just buy the phone outright and get the deal?  How can I do it?
Anti virus on the Note 5 Does anyone bother using any? I have lookout currently installed cause it's pre loaded with tmobile. But I wonder if it's an uneccesaary battery and memory drain.
Just bought a Note 5 (T-Mobile). What are some quick things I should do right away to get rid of bloatware and turn off unnecessary junk? I've already installed the Google Now Launcher. I do not want to root or install a custom ROM. What should every Note 5 owner do out of the box to turn off T-Mobile/Samsung bullshit?
Anybody have Cell standby draining battery on T-Mobile Note 5? Cell standby has been at the top of my battery drain and im only getting around 12 hours of battery with about 2 hours of SOT. I have quick chargers all over the place but still I would like to not have to worry about that.Any suggestions on getting rid of it short of going into airplane mode?
Available Storage After watching plenty of review videos, I haven't been able to find out how much available storage there is on the device out of the box.. I'm deciding between a 32 and 64 GB Note 5 and I don't want to get a 32 gig and end up filling it up too quick.When I was at Best buy it said there was only like 13 gigs or something available, which seemed absurd to me, but I figured this had to do with the store OS they put on there for demos.. So can any one help me out here?!

What does your home screen look like? Here's mine. 
Can we talk about Samsung Pay? I feel like I'm the only one who gets how cool this feature might be (assuming it works as advertised). Most people dismiss it too quickly, thinking it's just an Apply Pay/Google Wallet clone. It's not. It looks seriously fucking awesome. What people don't seem to get: It tricks magnetic card readers into thinking a physical card was swiped. So it should work on almost any physical card reader anywhere.Why this is exciting for me: Store reward cards, gift cards, credit cards, debit cards should all work with Samsung Pay! Google Wallet is a joke with gift cards it basically lets you track your fucking balances and you have to put all the transactions in manually. I've only had a couple experiences where a store could scan the QR code and actually complete a transaction without requiring the physical card. With the new Samsung hardware, you can forget all that bullshit of broken NFC terminals and clerks not knowing how to let you pay with your phone. You can (hopefully) enter that world of turning everyone's heads when they see you actually pay with your fucking phone wherever the fuck you want and not just at McDonald's if their NFC thing isn't broken.---So, I'm curious, what's going on out there? Do we just not care that much? do we not know what Samsung Pay actually is? Are we too distracted by the lack of MicroSD and removable battery? Are we worried about security? What's the deal? Why am I the only one excited about this? Does it already exist where an iPhone can trick a card reader into thinking a physical card has passed through it? I promise I'm not a shill, I know this post makes me look like one, check my post history if you don't believe it. I'm a Note 4 owner and generally like Samsung products (past three TVs have been Samsung). I don't care for Touchwiz but I'm willing to deal with it for the extra features the Note offers. In general, as shitty as  you might think this post is, I think Samsung Pay is worth talking about a bit more. So if you want to downvote me at least start up your own discussion with all kinds of cat pictures and clever pop cultural meme references or something so I can read what people think about this. That's all I want, because I'm confused and feeling like I'm the one who doesn't get it.
Note 5 radio(Lte GSM CDMA) question Anyone know if the note 5 will feature separate LTE and CDMA /GSM radios ??? I love my note 4 but I miss being able to talk over Bluetooth and surf the web at the same time while not on WiFi. My galaxy s3 allowed that. BTW I'm on a CDMA network.
Phone transition: Tap &amp Go vs Samsung Smart Switch I'm having a hard time finding comprehensive info on Lollipop Tap &amp Go and Samsung Smart Switch.  All info, input, experiences welcome.What differences do you know of between them?  Which did you use?  Did you experience any issues? (Can you use both without problems?)  Did either pull data from the SD card?  I'm moving from an S4 to the Note 5, and needless to say, I'd like it to be as seamless a transition as possible.
Upgrade time, need advice note 5 vs s6 edge+ My employer is about to order my phone upgrade. I currently have a Note 2, which I have liked, but have had a few issues with. I like the edge, but note 100% sure which way to go.Some of the issues I have had with the Note 2:* While on calls, my face/ear push stuff on the screen all the time, turning off wi-fi, bringing up world clock, etc.* TouchWiz was a bit crappy on this version, although I have heard its better now (and I assume used on the edge anyways)* After about 2 years, my charging port gave out, forcing me to buy a battery charger and swap out batteries all the time.* I never really had much of a use for the stylus, I will on occasion pull it out, but really never have a major need for it.
Is there a way to alpha-sort icons inside of folders in stock TouchWiz? I put a bunch of useful icons into a folder on my home screen but they are sorted in the order that I dropped them in there and that is a bit annoying for me personally.  I wish I could sort A-Z.  I know that Nova can do all that but I am really trying to be fair to the new TW on the Note 5 and not have to switch launchers so quickly.
Anyone have luck with tempered glass screen protectors? I ordered a Yootech tempered glass screen protector but it suffers from the dreaded halo effect, where the edges of the glass do not adhere to the display due to the Note 5's slight display curvature along the edges.This is evidently common among many tempered glass protectors and it is tough to determine which ones (if any) won't have the halo issue.Do you guys have any recommendations?

Let's talk wireless quick charging compatible devices Here is what we know.  Samsung announced wireless quick charging, a technology that combines quick charging with wireless charging. They have a compatible device up on their site.  http://m.gsmarena.com/samsungs_fast_wireless_charger_is_now_up_for_grabs_for_6999-blog-13602.phpI can't see paying that price.  Is anyone  aware of any chargers available with the tech yet other than Samsung original gear?
Root/Xposed questions I'm looking forward to getting one of these but I can't see myself using it full-time without at least root access (and preferably Xposed too). I'm still new to a lot of this Android dev stuff so I'm wondering, is work done towards getting these working on the S6/S6E likely to carry over to the N5 and get them working here faster? If that makes sense.And as a related question, how likely is it there'll be a workaround for using Samsung Pay with a tripped Knox counter? Is that something that just isn't possible or are there ways to reset Knox/fool the system into thinking it's still set?

Problems with glass screen protectors? I was just about to pull the trigger on a Zagg glass protector, but saw all kinds of complaining.  Apparently the glass doesn't fit the curvature of the screen well in some cases and there is a halo effect issue? Also, the Otterbox Commuter case I'm using causes problems. Anyone have first hand experience?

Note 5 Backwards S-Pen Button Extraction This is going to be a common issue popping up for sure, 2 days in and I already have seen a bunch of users with this problem.  It is simply a bad design and it is quite easy to ruin your 50$ s-pen with this problem.   There is no reason they should have designed it in the matter.  The button tip should be bigger than the hole and there should be an area in the casing machined out slightly bigger to allow it to sit flush.  It will be an easy revision if they choose to do it, otherwise I foresee some social media anger in the not too distant future, if the Note 5 Active doesn't quickly overshadow this model.   You know what I brought though? Solutions.      This major problem is that the S-pen clicker gets stuck in the holster port after you extract it after putting it in backwards. Inside the holster port is little catches that normally keep the s-pen in place, when the clicker button engages this it becomes stuck to the point where it can pop off the s-pen when extracting it.  The good news is that the button can be extracted, you have to build a tool to do so.      The tool you need a long, thin rod with a small barb on the end of it.  You insert this tool into the space between the button body and the holster port walls, you twist it in so the barbed hook engages the button body then you pull.  Eventually you can work the button out.  You can build this tool from a relatively thick paper clip.  Straighten the paper clip out, bend one side into a handle and the other side into a small hook.  Use a pair of wire cutters to cut the hook into a small sharp point.  When using this extraction tool you make need to utilize a small pair of pliers on the handle to get enough force both when twisting and when pulling out.        Let me be clear, I have no idea if this make cause damage to the internals of the holster port, but it beats sending it out for warranty with a button stuck inside it.  Once replacement Note-5 S-pens are out I'll test to see if there is any damage.  I may try to repair my s-pen with a small bit of epoxy on the button mating nib.  But I'll do some testing before I try to stick it back inside (in the correct orientation).https://snarky.smugmug.com/Spenextractor/i-W9DZk2p/0/L/20150824_135823-L.jpgTwo versions of the tool with source paper clip.  A pair of wire cutters and LED light will be handy.     https://snarky.smugmug.com/Spenextractor/i-whRHsG4/0/L/20150824_135845-L.jpgA closer view of the barbs tips.  You make have to trail and error the angle of the bend and the sizing.  The width of the hook diameter here is about 4mm.      https://snarky.smugmug.com/Spenextractor/i-g8xF8jf/0/L/20150824_140050-L.jpgFinally, here is that little bugger extracted.  Like I said, I'm going to see if I can reuse it.  If I get a positive response from actually posting this solution here, I'll post the repair of the s-pen here too.      Thank you guys, hope this helps some of you.
Is there a good and cheap case available right now for the Note 5 ? 
Is it stupid I am considering this phone because I love Samsung pay? I am bummed about the no SD card and also non removable battery, but the MST/NFC payments got me hyped.Is it stupid to want to get this phone for that being a primary reason? I honestly hate carrying my wallet around. I want to just have Samsung pay and my Driver license behind my case.How is MST and NFC payments going for the beta testers? I saw that it works at target (my go to store, in Portland, OR) any complications with the payment there?
Anyone considering the Moto X pure or nexus? I still have another week to return my note 5 and a few upcoming flagships interest me like the nexus and moto x pure.  Stock Android on the nexus interests me but I also like many of the features the note 5 offers like the battery life, one handed use, the camera, the display. The moto x has pretty close to stock but also has moto voice and the touch less voice controls has always interested me. Anyone else waiting to see what else comes out this month or next? 
Music squares gone? On my S4, the Samsung music player had something called Music Squares which would pull songs from your music library based on criteria you could select from a grid, like relaxing to energetic. I can't find this on the Note 5. Has anyone found it or an alternative?
Textra is not showing the option to use iOS emojis. Is this a problem with the Note 5 or Textra? This is my first samsung smartphone so I thought I'd ask here.  Basically, in Textra's settings for the Emoji style it only lets me select two options: Android (specifically Samsung type) Emojis and Twitter Emojis.  I'd really like to be able to use the iOS style emojis but is it even possible on Samsung devices? Or is this a Textra related issue?Thanks
Question: Must Have Power and Storage Accessories for Note 5 Can we start a thread for those who may be getting the note 5 but will be forced to have external power and storage options. In my case Bell is only carrying the 32gb note 5. My note 3 is on its last legs due to water damage and I like TouchWiz (rooted and stripped of garbage,  of course),  but I'm a power user.  Our data plans are ridiculously expensive,  so streaming and cloud storage isn't reliable and free public WiFi isn't really a thing. I also have titanium backups as well as romantic data on my SD card. It makes it a breeze to change phones and I don't want to break up data to my phone.  As well I am not always near an outlet. I currently carry a spare battery and a really old 3200mAh power bank. 1) what's the best compact power bank? I think 6000mAh min. 2) what's the best noon compact power bank? 1600mAh min3) what is the best way to have additional storage. I'll be backing up my phone every 2 to 3 days to this. I would like to see any available options. I'm trying my best to hold out to see the other phones. Surprisingly I'm so used to Samsung that I really didn't enjoy cm12 which should be close to a pure android experience. Please give us your tips. Sorry for any typos,  I'm on my phone. 
Don't be stupid, don't stick spen in backwards! Fml hopefully tmobile can replace it...
Launchers on the Note 5 What is everyone using? I like the changeable grid size and how TouchWiz is more customizable now. I have bought nova prime in the past,and Google launcher looks interesting. I've just never liked the idea of TouchWiz running under another launcher,even if there aren't any widgets running.
Anyone getting Google services as the highest battery usage? 
Samsung Branding So this is a very basic question. I have seen some videos and images which have different branding on the back of the phone. Some simply just have the Samsung logo at the top, but others i have seen also have 'Galaxy Note 5' at the bottom. Is there a standardized form for this does anyone know? Or is it purely just a random thing
An iPhone 6 users review of the Note 5 So I had an upgrade to burn on my jump plan before the period renewed so I figured I'd give android another shot with the Note 5 since it was the android phone that impressed me the most over the past year. Here are my impressions having switched from an iPhone 6 I had used for the past year. Also note that I've been on android MANY times before. I flip flop often so I'm not new here. First off I'll talk about the hardware. Being an iPhone user, I'm accustomed to the slick aluminum and glass build and I love it. I don't put cases on my phones because I appreciate a good build. I'm happy to say the note 5 doesn't disappoint by comparison to the iPhone. The aluminum trim feels great. The glass back, though not cool and crisp like the aluminum back on the iPhone still feels premium and feels gripper in my opinion. The white model I got doesn't show fingerprints which is certainly a plus. The phone is overall expertly built and I love holding it. This is a huge improvement over the last note I owned which was the Note 3  Software wise TouchWiz is light-years ahead of my last experience thankfully. It's no longer sluggish and jittery. I love the lollipop animations. It's a blast to use and far more exciting than ios. Sure the transition caused hiccups with imessage but that resolves itself in a couple days and it's not androids fault anyways. Little quirks I dislike primarily are some of the apps for email and podcast. The email apps are not as good imo as the stock apple app. Idk why so many developers don't include mark all as read as an option. The stock Samsung app, after some digging, does have the feature but it takes too many unnecessary steps. That's a nitpick thing I know but I use that a lot so it is annoying how many steps it takes. I also dislike that there is no stock podcast app and you have to dig through the app store for some 3rd party options. Player fm  I found after trying a few since it's the only one that competes with apples stock app. Another nitpick I know but basic functions like this I feel should be apps that are slick and available out of the box without having to go through trial and error. On the whole android has finally gotten to a point with its ui  that it can keep up with ios. No more jank and jitter. Steady framerate. It's just fun to use. Ios on the other hand is plain boring to use. It gets the job done. Edit: One big quirk I hate also is the inaccuracy of the fingerprint sensor. Idk if my unit is defective but it has like no better than a 50% success rate. Almost always takes multiple tries. I have to hold the phone just right to get it to work on the first try. Battery life: This is my one big disappointment with the Note 5 and Android. I know that most of the blame is on Google with their optimization of android but part of it goes to Samsung with the smaller 3000mah battery. The Note 5 is able to last me through my average workday comfortably which is great for most people. But when you're like me who came from an iPhone 6 with its teeny little 1800mah battery which could last 10-15% longer it is upsetting. You expect a big phablet  to pack great battery life and it annoys me that this drains so quickly. If my iPhone was at 100% before I went to sleep, I would wake up the next morning and it still had 100%. I do the same with the Note 5 and it will have just over 80%. If the phone isn't doing anything it shouldn't be draining battery like this. Standby needs to be improved on android. They need to find a way to be at least nearly as efficient as ios. In summation, battery life is perfectly fine and satisfactory, but when compared to iPhones  with tiny batteries, it is annoying that this can't touch them. The quick charger is also a big help in case you need a quick refuel after work for a night out. It really does make a difference and it isn't a gimmick. I really liked this feature and it did alleviate my anger at the relatively poor battery life.  Camera I can't comment on because I'm not a photo taker so Idk what's good and bad. Every review says it's the best so let's just trust them lol. If you ask me if I would go back to the iPhone I'd say probably yeah because of the battery life, and all my friends are on imessage but it's such a narrow reason to go back. The Note 5 is a fantastic phone that I enjoy and if I didn't have T-mobile jump, I totally would be fine being stuck with this phone for another year.Anyways there it is. Hope you enjoyed.
Loving the Note 5 camera 
Whats the best camera setting to take fireworks pics at night? I can use trial and error but hoping someone can advise.
Is Samsung going to forget about the Note 5 just like they did with the Note 4? What an awful company Samsung is by basically leaving the Note 4 in the dark without the Android 5.1 update nor updating it's TouchWiz skin to reflect the Galaxy S6's skin. Do not buy the Note 5 if you are going to reret later on when the Galaxy S7 and you realize you won't expierence any of the new software features of the S7 in a future update, because the Note 5 will have the S6 skin and you'll be stuck with it. I'm telling you from experience. Because Samsung only favors S owner and not Note owners
Another rumor about Note 5, S pen is tactile and new feature named quicknote...quicknote sounds nice. 
PSA: Note 5 Forgot Fingerprint and Backup password I got the Note 5 on Friday. I have been using the fingerprint unlock everyday. It has been fantastic. Yesterday I tried unlocking my phone and after 3 or so attempts which failed it asked for my backup password. I input it and it didn't accept. I made it very easy because I didn't want to forget it and so I was sure it was correct. I did some googling and apparently this is a known issue with S6s. The phone can forget you fingerprint and backup password.I called samsung and they told me I should have added the note 5 to the FindMyPhone.Samsung website so that they could unlock it. They redirected me to Sprint who told me to try Android Device Manager. This started working, but was slow and so I ended up just doing a factory reset. I'm not sure if that would have worked.Today I went online to register the phone with FindMyPhone and apparently the Note 5 is not compatible with that service...I tested Android Device Manager and it does work in this situation. It is also snappy when you have good data service.Good luck.
Charging really slow My Note 5 has been taking forever to charge, started happening after the most recent T-Mobile update. Swapped out the cable with a few different one and there is no change. I also tried a new Samsung fast charger and that did not help. Any similar issues or suggestions?Edit: I should mention that the phone does not fast charge, it just says charging. But it is still slower than normal charging. 
[HELP] My Note 5 doesn't get any service anymore! I occasionally get a message saying that my phone is having a hard time activating but I already activated it and have been using it for a couple of weeks. It also says th a try I can only make emergency calls. I'm with Verizon, BTW. 
Why doesn't the Note 5 have USB - C? Lots of rumors before the release indicated it would. If it did, i would have traded off the non removable battery for USB- c Anyone have any conjecture as to why it ended up not getting it, or maybe there will be a re-released version that does?as it is, i think i'll replace the battery in my Note 3 and continue using it until we get USB c in a note. 
Does anyone realize that the image to the right of this subreddit is not a real image of a note 5!?!?! You can tell by the ugly white camera bezel. The real one has a black camera bezel
My inner feud with the Note 5 So the only things I PERSONALLY don't like: Samsung Pay only works with a few banks, none of mine are included: so that being said, I've been holding off on rooting my phone (or at least attempting to) until I know for sure that it's gunna be a while for a bank of mine to be supported... Samsung has done better with touchwiz, but I still get lagginess with a 4gb, Exynos octacore phone. My OnePlus One felt faster as far as pressing a button, and bam, screen loaded. But then there's also Android Pay that doesn't work with a rooted phone. I heard Chainfire has a workaround for now that won't be supported much longer. Feel free to gripe and complain about your little grievances as well. 
No headphones? My note 5 did not have headphones included. Not even a spot for them in the package. What gives?
Samsung Pay with American Express and Sprint Hello,I struggled all day yesterday to get my Amex card to work with my Note5. It turns out I had two issues.1. I hadn't update the Samsung Pay software all the way. When I went to More in the app, then Settings, then About Samsung Pay, there was an update waiting for me.2. This morning I received an email from Amex saying I should call in. I did, got sent to a few different people who had just got corporate info on setting up Samsung Pay and they finally sent me a confirmation email with a one time password which I told them.Bam. Working perfectly. I love this phone.
How's Samsung Pay going for everyone? In beta it worked 90% of the time for me. Now I'm getting more and more card read error messages at terminals everywhere I go (I'm for 3 today!)I'm ready to ditch Samsung Pay because if it doesn't work it's just a gimmick. Plus when they announced it they were talking about gift cards and rewards cards from merchants being compatible. But the app won't take anything but a traditional credit or debit card. I don't think they're putting their best effort into this, and if they aren't, the service is doomed.
Charger getting really hot Does anyone's charger, the part that connects to the port, get extremely hot when charging? Mine gets hot to the point it hurts when touched. How big of a problem is this?

Day 1 with the Note 5! I've spent a full day with this device now and here's my battery life so far.http://i.imgur.com/S2aejHC.pngHere's my home page customization. It's based on what I had on the S3 before I made the upgrade!http://i.imgur.com/UU85N8g.pngOverall I'm pretty happy with it and I'm surprised how often I use the pen. It helps me a lot! (I'm a student)Ordered a Sprigen Neo Hybrid CC case + JETech tempered glass screen protector.
anyone get the best buy deal (20off and the charger) while buying the phone outright? I went to 1 location Thursday to preorder and they said I had to activate it or get a new line.

Battery Drain? Hi /r/galaxynote5I'm sure I could google this.Should you let your battery run flat or is it best to charge beforehand?This is more about battery tech I guess.
Thin cases with a kickstand? Hello everybody,I have an upgrade at the end of September and I'm looking to get rid of this iPhone and purchase a Note 5.  I'm not a fan of cases, but I want something to prop the phone up.  So I'm looking for a thin case that has a kickstand on it.I found one on Amazon but was wondering if there was a certain brand or design that you guys preferred?  Thanks.
There may be a 128GB Note 5 after all... 
Screen Mirroring Options? How can I mirror my Note 5 to my TV? I want to play games and watch movies. I would prefer a direct connection (HDMI), but something like a Chromecast would be okay too. Sidesync crashes on my pc, so thats out of the question for now. (unless someone has a fix!) Thanks!
The best battery life I have gotten on this phone so far! [deleted]
Sprint people with Note 5's already, how is the bloat? How many bloat apps (other than stock Samsung and Google apps)? Can you delete any of them?
[NOTE 3 - OTHER] Goodbye Samsung My girlfriend and I own about $3k worth of phones, tablets, and monitors. I love Samsung and I think their products are reliable and well built but their direction is now to follow apple in every aspect. I use my phone for work, I get a lot of email, I need a lot of battery life, I need to swap sd cards - samsung took away removable batteries and the micro sd card essentially  copying apple. I need those two things as I swap batteries daily because I don't have time to charge or have power to charge and I use my phone to transfer data or view video files from a GoPro - with these features gone, I have buy reason to buy another note. Samsung hasn't innovated in years. There's nothing new to entice new users. I know Samsung doesn't care, but in case they read.Goodbye, it's been a great 8 years.
Package Disabler Pro is not available for purchase in my country. I can't even activate the one I downloaded off Aptoide. Need to improve battery drain. Anyone got suggestions? My Note 5's battery life can use all the help it can get.
Galaxy Note 5, dbrand skin, screen protector experience I wanted to share my recent experience with dbrand skins, Spigen screen protectors, and my new galaxy note 5. I ordered the brushed titanium skin for the back and the dark brushed titanium skin for the front. Dbrand shipped within 2 days and it was delivered  about 4 days later to my address in Indiana, much ahead of the projected 7-14 day delivery window. I assumed that a screen protector would be included with the skin, as some other dbrand skins include screen protectors, however the galaxy note 5 skin does not. After emailing dbrand, I was told that they were working on developing a screen protector for the note 5 but for the time being, I could put the front skin over a third party screen protector. They did warn that I had to be careful with putting the dbrand skin over a screen protector because the skin would bond very strongly with the vinyl and it would be impossible to fix mistakes.I thought I'd try going without a screen protector, as dbrand recommended. I installed the front and back skins according to directions. The back fit was perfect, and nobody could tell it was a skin. The front skin came with 2 options: one option had separate pieces for the top and bottom and the other option was one continuous piece that covered the top and bottom and framed the left/right sides for the front. I chose the separate pieces. The fit was a bit wide for both pieces--they slightly covered the raised metal bezel around the phone. However the cutouts for the home key, camera, and leds were perfect. The skin stayed put fairly well, no peeling or anything.After a few days with skin only, it seemed my phone screen was getting microscratches, probably not in the gorilla glass itself but in the oleophobic coating. I don't keep my phone in my pocket, most of the time it's kept in my laptop sleeve. Annoyed, I ordered the Spigen crystal screen protector. I was anticipating trouble in removing the dbrand front skin, but to my surprise the pieces peeled off easily and without deformation. I then wiped the screen with the spigen provided wet wipe, removed any dust particles with the provided stickers, and installed the PET screen protector. I proceeded to replace the front skin pieces (the same ones I had removed). I tried my best to get perfect alignment the first time, but failed on one of the pieces. Luckily, it detached fairly easily from the PET screen protector so that I could have  second go at it.All in all, both products turned out to be OK.  Not amazing, but ok. The fit of the dbrand skin was less than perfect but installation was reasonable and the skins seem to be reusable on the Galaxy Note 5. The Spigen screen protector is a fingerprint and grease magnet but otherwise seems to be easy to install in conjunction with my dbrand skin.
S Pen stuck barely out (correct way) I dropped my phone and the S Pen came out a bit. This has happened before, so I just pushed it in. However, it went in only until there was about an inch left still sticking out of the phone. The pen is currently in there the correct way, but it has been inserted backwards in the past. I tried sliding paper/plastic alongside the pen and that didn't help. Anybody else ever have this problem? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
Help: Screen randomly freezes ATT Note 5, Google now launcher, keyboard and messenger, otherwise all is stock.Screen randomly freezes and becomes unresponsive, locks up for a couple of seconds.Any ideas why this is happening? This is the 2nd Note 5 that I've had replaced because of this issue.
Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Angle Mockup 
to any one looking For answers about USAA supporting Samsung Pay, here's their answer directly from Twitter. 
Samsung Announces Galaxy Note 5 and S6 Edge Plus 
After 6 years grinding apple's pole, having every iDevice in the market, I can finally say after purchasing the NOTE 5 today I DO NOT REGRET IT! THIS THING IS PURE AWESOME, MULTITASKING?! WHAT ?! NOTE TAKING ON THE FLY?! WHAT ?! SYNC THIS BAD BOY TO YOUR COMP SO YOU DON'T MISS ANY ACTION ON YOUR PHONE ?! WHAT ?! 10PLUS OTHER FEATURES! I simply don't regret converting to android not one bit, NOW I DO NEED YOUR HELP! what is the must have apps in the play store? (please no games). What are some good setting optimizations I can do to preserve my battery life and any other pro tip to give a newbie android user such as myself 
My G2 had the ability to turn off data from the top pull down widgets. Does the Note 5 not do this? I have options like Wifi, bluetooth, Vibrate, Portrait, Wifi Calling, etc, but no easy single touch way to disable or enable data. My current solution is to pull the top menu down, hit the gear icon, navigate to data, and then push the toggle switch. This can't be right. I've hit the little pencil icon to edit the options I have and there's nothing for data!
Textra is not showing the option to use iOS emojis. Is this a problem with the Note 5 or Textra? This is my first samsung smartphone so I thought I'd ask here.  Basically, in Textra's settings for the Emoji style it only lets me select two options: Android (specifically Samsung type) Emojis and Twitter Emojis.  I'd really like to be able to use the iOS style emojis but is it even possible on Samsung devices? Or is this a Textra related issue?Thanks
Protip: If you can't order a free wireless charging pad because it's backordered, search ET-PG920WCSAM1 on the Samsung website instead Saw this on XDA today after searching for some sort of alternative. Just search ET-PG920WCSAM1 on the Samsung website and a special version made specifically for the Samsung Pay promo comes up. 
Does Note 5 not support a 36controller over OTG? The note 4 would let me control the main screens and play any game with a 36controller. When I plug one in on the note 5 it gets power but no input. Anyone had luck with this? I could only find one other thread with no comments.
When I get a text when my headphones are plugged in, my notifications are played through the speakers instead of the headphones. Is there a way to change this? 
Question regarding gear vr and no holder for it? So tonight I installed the Google card board app t look at some vr content. Holding the device to my face, shouldn't it display like it would otherwise? The image became singular but was completely blurry? Maybe it shouldn't work but logically in my brain it should work.
Does anyone have a anti privacy screen protector on their Note? I have been looking and looking and I just don't want to spend $45 on the *Zagg* screen protector. Anyone have a smaller company protector on? 
Issues with note taking app. Am I just doing something wrong? So when you pull your pen out there nor taking app opens up. On top you have the buttons you can select. Touching then does nothing. Aren't they supposed to?
Any drawbacks in using an unlocked Sprint Note 5 in a GSM network? I just saw an unlocked Sprint Note 5 on sale at a good price, the local carrier where I would use it has 4G LTE and GSM networks, would I encounter any problems since I guess it is a CDMA phone?
How pissed are you that the Galaxy Note 5 didn??t end up having a micro SD slot or removable battery? [POLL] 
Dynamic Video/Sound Editor (with pop-up notes) ? Can anyone tell me how to, or recommend an app that does, add notes and pop up notes to videos or voice recordings? I'm thinking about something like SoundCloud where the clip plays and there are little notes that pop up while playing. Something you can use to add notes to a played back clip for further editing and revision down the line.
Note 5 VZW Connection Issue I've had the 64gb Note 5 for about a month now. Recently after an update I've noticed something rather annoying. I can turn mobile data on from the quick tabs &amp it works fine for maybe an hour, but if I leave my phone alone (screen off) for about 30mins or so later I can not get online. Mobile data is still enabled, but the 4G LTE indicator isn't lit up. If I disable mobile data &amp re-enable it, I still cannot connect. I have to restart the phone for it to work. Anyone else having this problem? I'm hoping someone can help me before I go to Verizon for help.

Can't flash stock firmware for my Note 5 from odin. I rooted my phone yesterday it was working good but after one of the restarts my note 5 would get stuck on the T-Mobile splash screen at boot. I wanted to flash the stock firmware for the N920T on Odin (3.10.7) but it doesn't seem to be working like it did with the noble kernel. I posted some images from Odin and my note 5 on XDA to see if there is something I might be doing wrong?[Post on XDA](http://forum.xda-developers.com/note5/help/trying-to-flash-n920t-stock-firware-bad-t3217283)
Shockproof Case for the Note 5 $3.79 
Has anyone come from the iPhone 6 Plus, that wouldn't go back? I'm thinking seriously about selling my 6 Plus for the Note 5. I'm starting a career in Real Estate, and think the Note 5 would come in very handy. I sold my Galaxy S5 for the iPhone 6 plus because updates just don't happen with the Galaxy line, and I wanted a bigger screen. Now I'm not that worried about the latest and greatest from Android...and I can wait for Samsung to push it out. Has anyone else already jumped the iPhone 6 Plus ship for the beautiful N5?
Zerolemon 3500mah case released for N5 [removed]
Price of a gold galaxy note 5 Hey guys. This is probably an odd question but me and my family have our upgrade for sprint ready and I was going to use all the upgrades to get the $5note 5 from best buy, sell them, and get the phones we want from somewhere else.     The gold Titanium color of the Note 5 for sprint was just released and I was wondering if the color of the phone could affect the price one would buy it for? And how much do you guys suggest listing a brand new (still wrapped)  32gb gold titanium Galaxy note 5 for on swappa? Thanks in advance. 
Screen not working PLEASE HELP IM CRYING I just dropped my phone and the screen stopped working. The S-Pen still works on the screen, but my phone does not register my touches. I already reset the phone what else can I do.
Is there a custom ROM available for the Note5? 
Constantly checking for updates One major reason I got the note 5 is I whole heartedly believe in samsung pay. With the release tomorrow I have been refreshing app updates for the phone, galaxy apps, and the Samsung pay app itself. I would love to know which one and when it will be. I was accepted into the beta however I have chase bank, so I have to keep waiting for the official release. Hopefully tomorrow everything completes. At least I have been using android pay to hold me over in the meantime 
Not enough room? Have you guys been having trouble with the 32 GB of memory that this phone has? I  find myself having to delete pics and apps to make room for new pics and apps. I didn't have an issue with my Note 4 and I didn't even install an SD card on it. Why couldn't they make the note 5 with a removable back? 
The Big Question: Is it the Note 5 or the Note5? Samsung's official page refers to it without the space, it's the Galaxy Note5, despite the space between Note and digit in the past. But very few folks, if any, are writing it this way. MUSN'T WE ALL COME TOGETHER ON THIS?
Sometimes my phone doesn't respond to OK Google unless I hit the mic button. Sometimes it responds, but when instead of showing the voice input bars, it says Cannot open microphone (or something similar). Anyone else having this problem? Seems intermittent but still annoying when I'm driving and I can't do handsfree calling. 
S-Pen and Rooting Google seems to confuse my search with inserting the pen backwards.  If you root your phone, does the S-Pen still work?  I don't particularly enjoy the bloatware from Verizon. 
Since we don't have a MicroSD slot or Removable battery... Does anyone know of a case that implement a battery and an MicroSD slot for OTG?If not....does someone want to fund a kickstarter?
Ordering at the Store - Early Release? I was in a store earlier this week and they confirmed the Friday release. What are the chances they surprise us and make them available early? They have to have them at least a day before - Let's use this to track any rumors of an early release at the actual stores.
Rooted: How to Remove Bloat, what is safe to remove? I've rooted my device (First android ever and first time doing this) and I must say I am not super tech savvy. I want to remove all that is safe to remove. I can't seem to google a good list, except [this one here](http://www.andromods.com/apps-mod/disable-remove-bloatware-safe-list-galaxy-note-5.html). I think this might be an good place to start but how do I go about finding those items on my actual device and *then* how do I remove them safely?I do have Titanium Backup and SuperSU installed and have created 3 backups to Google Drive. 
Defective phone or just my OCD? If you havent seen my posts before they all have to do with these 2 main issues...Before you say it, yes I have done a complete factory reset before posting here. Did the reset about a week ago now.I've had my phone off of the charger for 5.5 hours and I have just under (like a few minutes) 1 hour of SOT and my battery is at 62%. Bluetooth and location and WiFi are all off. Auto brightness like usual so idk what is causing it. Nothing strange in my battery usage section.I'm also having issues (before and after the factory reset) where the screen won't turn on when I press either the power button or the home button the first try. It takes 2-3 presses (sometimes more) to get the screen to come on. If I only press it once then let it go the screen will never come on. It isn't registering that I'm actually pressing the button at all.Also, my phone seems to overheat when on the charger or the screen is on for long periods of time. It doesn't get too hot to use (like my LG G3 does) but it gets hot enough that you notice it with battery life and such. I don't game, I watch YouTube videos, text, call, and browse and post on Reddit (via sync with night mode (and until recently the AMOLED night mode)). So not heavy usage in my book but the screen does get warm and then takes a while to cool down when the screen is off.Title is my question. I'd rather not pay $2to get a new phone through TMobile but I will if I have to.EDIT: Now I can't watch YouTube videos on my phone with auto rotation on. I was holding the phone steady and it kept circling between on rotation and the other thinking I was moving the phone in either horizontal rotation... I wasn't moving at all. This is really weird.
Question about themes for Note 5 Hey, I just got a Note 5, and I'm quite liking it. There is one thing that I'd like to tweak though, I'm a fan of the sci-fi theme for it, but I don't much like the background. Is there any way to get the background for that theme so I can mess with it? Thanks!
Any issues so far? Hey guys, I am using a Note 3 for now. Thinking of upgrading to Note 5 this December. Before I do, can any of you confirm the news about the heating problems in Note 5, floating around? I have heard the same about Edge+ too. I am thinking of buying my SO an Edge+. Can't find any videos or definitive posts, would really appreciate your help. Thanks.
Galaxy Note 5 N920C 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE for $549.99 
Considering the Note5, what are your favorite and least favorite things about the Note5? I currently have an HTC M8 and have a plan that allows me to upgrade to a new phone every year. I've been eyeballing the Note5 as my next upgrade because its specs and some of the features, that SPen has me interested, seem very nice and  I'm honestly concerned about the future of HTC. In my research it seems like the android community is bitterly divided about this phone with some praising the new design and others damning Samsung for getting rid of a few feature some found as a necessity. I've seen much debate about a lagging issue regarding the software, with some claiming it makes the phone unusable and others claiming to have no idea what this lag issue is. I wanted to hear from people that have the Note5 and use it everyday to get a true understanding of the phone. What are the big pluses you experience with this phone and what some of the downsides of the phone?

Will the international Galaxy Note 5 work on ATT LTE? Just checking if anyone else is looking to buy the Note 5 unlocked.

Samsung Pay - Default Mobile Payment option missing (only have Android Pay) So I'll try to keep it short and simple. Installed the latest Verizon update for my Note5, installed Samsung Pay from the Google Store, set it up, added a card. I do have Android Pay on my phone too since it supports more cards than Samsung Pay, but I'll use Samsung Pay for non-NFC terminals. On my lock screen, I swiped up and activated Samsung Pay. Each time I tried to use it at a terminal, Android Pay would override it and Samsung Pay wouldn't work.So I went into Settings, NFC and Payment, Tap and Pay, and noticed that Android Pay is the only payment service that appears. I turned on Prioritize Foreground Application so when the Samsung Pay app is open, it will be used before Android Pay. However, that still doesn't work, and I think it's because Samsung Pay isn't an option under Tap and Pay in the settings.Does anyone else have this issue? I have *not* done a factory reset even though I side-loaded the Samsung Pay Framework pre-VZW Update that I got yesterday, but the Verizon update yesterday fixed my ability to use Samsung Pay in general. But the main problem is that Android Pay overrides Samsung Pay every time I hold it up to a terminal, and I'm thinking it's because Samsung Pay isn't an option under Tap and Pay in the settings.
Clear rear Plastic protector for note 5 Anyone recommend any ?Just after a clear PET screen protector for the rear that covers the whole backI've purchased a ringke fusion case which comes with a back protector but it's very thin and doesn't cover the whole back. I'm not interested in a dbrand skin, my note 5 is titanium and do not want to cover it's beauty :)Thanks. Edit. UK based 
Short lag/stutter at end of video recording? Whenever I try to record a video, there is a short lag once I end the recording. It's not just processing, as the camera/mic are still active. What it basically does is add a 1 second still frame to the end of the video with whatever sound occurred during that second. Does anyone else have this? Is this just crappy design or is there something messed up in my software? I really don't think it's hardware because this happens to both my rear and front-facing cameras, and I doubt both of them would have hardware deficiencies. Thanks!
Android system destroying battery? I got the Verizon Note5 on saturday, and Android system is having a really big impact on my battery. My phone would only last around 2hours on standby. Today it has used 30% of my battery. Are there any fixes for this?

I am blown away by how good the zoom in is on this camera 
Just my two cent review after having used the phone well over a month now. Traditionally, I've been an Android purist with a few exceptions (HTC EVO 4G, HTC One, and now  Note 5). I've even dabbled with iOS (iPhone 5S followed by 6 Plus) for over a year until recently. A phone with a stylus? No. Who needs that? I always said. And I certainly didn't think I'd be going to Samsung again after my Galaxy Nexus days were over. But here I am today, rocking a Samsung with a stylus. All things considered, I'm pretty happy with my decision. I almost got the 6S Plus. Apple has had a way of pulling me in (iPad owner, MacBook Pro owner), but I just didn't wanna wait for it. My girlfriend recently got the S6E+ and I loved the screen, camera, and battery life she was getting. I decided to go Note for those reasons *plus* the stylus. I never had a stylus on a phone since the Samsung Omnia back in 2009 (remember that?). So I did. Overall, I'm getting excellent battery life, the camera is simply amazing (I love that it shoots RAW as I'm an avid hobbyist photographer that plays with Lightroom a lot), the screen is gorgeous, the phone feels great in hand (I go without a case at home), and I just flat out missed Android. I won't go into all the reasons why I'm loving this phone as this whole review was just something I decided to thumb out on a whim anyway while laying in bed, but some of my favorite stylus apps are Sketchbook Express and Flip-A-Clip (animation). Having a stylus has also been useful for grading rubrics for when I'm being a teacher. Editing PDFs is a breeze. Even editing pictures on Snapseed using a stylus opens up new creative avenues. Just wanted to write out some love for the phone that it surely deserves, especially with all these new phones coming out this season. For anyone looking to get a new phone, don't overlook this beauty, even though it's been out a couple months now. It's a worthy contender in a lineup of great Android phones.
NFC chip location Does anyone know EXACTLY where the NFC chip is in the Note5?  I have a metal plate in my case for a magnet holder in my car and it inhibits NFC.  Trying to get the exact location so the plate doesn't muck it up.
Just bought an AT&ampT Note 5. Has anyone found a way to change the settings menu to a list view instead of tabs? 
Flipboard Briefing Ok so, love the layout of the Briefing widget but can't stand how slow/buggy it is, especially when flipping between home screens. Today I was messing around with the settings and increased the cache usage to 512mb. Boom. It feels much, much quicker now and there is very little lag when switching to and from my home screen to the briefing widget. Does anyone know any negative impacts this may have on my phone's performance or if this change is actually making a difference or I'm just feeling the placebo effect? 
Anyone have a dock that works? Looking for a good dock that will work well with a case. Using this case :http://www.amazon.com/dp/B010MWIG1K/ref=twister_B010MWHU7Q?_encoding=UTF8&amppsc=1
DPI setting too high Got the note 5 and feel the DPI setting is too high.  The text seems really small and increasing the font size only works in some apps.I wish Samsung would have left it the same as note 4, but oh well.  I'm in Verizon so the chance of getting root are slim to none.Does the Edge plus have the same DPI setting?
Speaker sounds robotic... Has anyone else noticed the Note 5 speaker makes voices all sound like Optimus Prime?  It's that overly digital sound.  It's not horrible, but noticeable on my Note. 
Verizon Note 5 has a software update available (security update) Downloading it now. Is it possible this might have some fixes? Or is it just going to be a security update?
Is Samsung Kids Mode launcher not compatible with Marshmallow? I flashed 6.through ODIN on my T-Mobile Note 5 last night and whenever I try to open Kids Mode it says it can't connect to the server.

Question: Must Have Power and Storage Accessories for Note 5 Can we start a thread for those who may be getting the note 5 but will be forced to have external power and storage options. In my case Bell is only carrying the 32gb note 5. My note 3 is on its last legs due to water damage and I like TouchWiz (rooted and stripped of garbage,  of course),  but I'm a power user.  Our data plans are ridiculously expensive,  so streaming and cloud storage isn't reliable and free public WiFi isn't really a thing. I also have titanium backups as well as romantic data on my SD card. It makes it a breeze to change phones and I don't want to break up data to my phone.  As well I am not always near an outlet. I currently carry a spare battery and a really old 3200mAh power bank. 1) what's the best compact power bank? I think 6000mAh min. 2) what's the best noon compact power bank? 1600mAh min3) what is the best way to have additional storage. I'll be backing up my phone every 2 to 3 days to this. I would like to see any available options. I'm trying my best to hold out to see the other phones. Surprisingly I'm so used to Samsung that I really didn't enjoy cm12 which should be close to a pure android experience. Please give us your tips. Sorry for any typos,  I'm on my phone. 
Help - Lost S Pen I dropped my Note 5 in the dark earlier today and seemingly lost the stylus. I didn't realize it until well after and I have no way of going back to find it. What are my options? I have checked eBay and saw several ads and placed an order because I really need one. Will those work? I get the feeling that any Note5 stylus will work as long as it's Samsung,  or am I wrong? 
What screen protector do you use and do you recommend it? I remember a thread a few months ago and there was controversy what glass screen protector to use. I just picked up one off of amazon and it has that halo effect and it smudged a lot. Last night I just had enough and ripped it off. What glass screen protector should I go with next?
Scroll capture missing I can't find the option anymore after taking a screen write. Yesterday I got an update which to the latest android patch level. Did anyone face this?
Note5 tweaking out. Thinks dock is connected when it is disconnected from evverything. Keeps spamming not charging and trying to launch samsung VR. As title says. Phone has been acting really strange the last few days. It won't fast charge, thinks it is connected to a dock when I've never even had it on one, and keeps spamming that it's not charging notification when is clearly disconnected. Also samsung VR launches itself nonstop every time you close it if I go into my settings. It is really bothering me and I don't want to have to do a factory reset if I don't have to. What can I do? Thanks in advance!

Fast Charging issue So all of the sudden it takes me 50times for my fast charging to work, when I plug it in it just does cable charging, I have to keep unplugging and plugging the charger back in the phone in order for it to randomly work. It worked fine before. - N920T
The new Snpachat update (released today) fixes the new lenses feature that didn't work with yesterday's update! Just figured everyone should know. I saw a comment from someone in the post from yesterday, but figured I'd make a post because it'd get wider recognition.So what do you guys think? Was it a bug, or is the Note really behind on this sort of shit? Also, how is the freaking hangouts app for you guys? I had to switch to Textra because the lag is so awful. 
Tip If you want to scan more than 4 fingers or if other people use your phone, scan both thumbs at once and both index fingers at once etc. It doesn't change performance but doubles the amount of fingers you can use.

Connected as installer Whenever I connect to my PC via USB, the phone always cycles through: Connected as installer -&gt Connected as media device.

Is it possible to disable the installer?  Is the solution root only?Example of message: http://imgur.com/l0q6gyX

Audio from the jack is very weak I recently got the note 5, and it was working perfectly. But whenever I try and play music using the jack the output volume is very soft, I've tried with all different earphones to make sure it wasn't a fault with the earphones, and with all of them the output is so low. Is there any way to fix this?

Samsung Employee comments on UNPACKED event and the Note 5 and S6 Edge Plus launch - FUNNY (laughing man) 
What's the max. charging current for this phone? The adaptive fast charger that came with my phone says that it outputs 1.67A at 9V or 2A at 5V. However, I'm looking into power banks and noticed that some output 2.1A and 2.4A. If I get a power bank that has a 5V 2.4A output, would the phone even draw 2.4A, or would it just be limited to 2A? If it does draw 2.4A, would that make it charge faster than the adaptive fast charger, or will that damage the phone? I've been looking around for documentation about this, but haven't found anything. This is my first phone with the fast charging feature, so I'm not really sure about these things.

Phone transition: Tap &amp Go vs Samsung Smart Switch I'm having a hard time finding comprehensive info on Lollipop Tap &amp Go and Samsung Smart Switch.  All info, input, experiences welcome.What differences do you know of between them?  Which did you use?  Did you experience any issues? (Can you use both without problems?)  Did either pull data from the SD card?  I'm moving from an S4 to the Note 5, and needless to say, I'd like it to be as seamless a transition as possible.

There are times where my finger is hovering over the glass and not making contact and it will open an app.I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this issue. If so, how are you handling it? Screen protector, new phone, etc.
Randomly not receiving Kik messages until I open the app Since I've been using Kik messenger on my Note 5, I'll sometimes notice that notifications aren't coming through and when I open the app, messages that had been sent to me ages ago all suddenly appear.Could this be to do with the Note 5s bad RAM management, in that it likes to close apps in the background?
I'm wondering... I noticed that the Note 5 is called the Note5 why is that? Just a bit curious because even the back of my Note 5 it says Galaxy Note5

I am still deciding between the Note 5 and the Galaxy s6 Edge, because the plan prices from my carrier are the same. So can you please give me some insite as to whether the Note 5 is worth it over the S6 Edge, Much obliged potential future sub~RakkieD
Magnetic and micro usb charging simultaneously Hello, I plan to get a Note 5. Is it possible to simultaneously charge your phone using the magnetic charger and micro usb? Would that increase the electric current output to charge your phone faster?
Anyway to stop the automatic memory assistance with the ATT version of the note 5? I can't stand how my apps have to refresh after about 1min of not using them causing me to lose my place on websites im viewing. I saw that this is actually a feature that helps with memory, but I cannot for the life of me figure out how to turn it off with the ATT note 5. Anyone know how?
Google Messenger MMS not sending I have a Note 5 on AT&ampT running 5.1.1 that isn't sending or receiving MMS on the Messenger app. Tried all of the basic troubleshooting steps short of factory resetting the phone, as I'd rather just use a different messaging app than go through that process. No issues using Hangouts or the Samsung Messages app, but Google Messenger is my favorite overall SMS app so I was wondering if anyone else had encountered this and if there is a way to fix it without the factory reset?
Samsung note 5 problems Note 5 keeps on rebooting every 30mins. Already factory reset it twice btw. Any advice will be appreciated.
Which keyboard are you using? I didn't see any other thread covering this, and I need a suggestion.The built in Samsung one was fine at first, but I've noticed that its swiping is really rough, when compared to Google's keyboard. But the official Google keyboard can't have the number row on top, which is very nice to have given the screen real estate. So, what are you guys using?
Which SMS/MMS app are you guys using? I've been a fan of Textra for a couple of years but it has been giving me issues since I started using the Note 5. How do you feel about the stock messaging app?
Is it possible to have notifications wake the screen? I like being able to quick view my notifications without having to unlock the phone if it is on my desk next to me. Would be nice to be able to have the screen wake when it gets a notification.
Anyone tried any of these battery cases? Seen a few kind of cheap looking Chinese cases with batteries built in. Most look exactly the same with different brand names.

5.1.1 update network issues Dear All, I just upgraded to 5.1.1 and there seems to be issue with the network. The update was pushed to me yesterday and I am in Bangalore, India. It keeps loosing the network connection very frequently. Frequently means every  5 seconds. It connects to network and then disconnects from the network and again tries to connect. Its happening since the upgrade and also affecting the battery.  Anybody facing same issue? Any help is highly appreciated. Thanks . 
Camera and S-pen compared to note 4? Hey all! For people who have used both the Note 5 and the Note 4, how do the camera and the s-pen compare between the phones? I'm upgrading soon and looking at a ~10price difference between a new note 5 and a certified pre-owned note 4, so wondering if the 5 is worth it.Camera and S-Pen are my two biggest concerns with getting the phone. Don't mind the lack of storage/battery on the 5 or less-fancy looks on the 4 at all. I do want to be able to get updates though (they can take their time, but I'd like to get them eventually, haha).Thanks in advance for any advice! I've been searching everywhere but am having trouble comparing these specific features, so it's much appreciated :-) 
Mediaserver battery problem I just got my Note 5 a few days ago and I'm loving it so far. However, last night, the battery drained a little faster than I'm used to - From 40% to 14% in the span of about 7 hours while I slept. I looked at battery usage and the Media Server accounted for nearly all of the usage. I've searched a little bit regarding a fix for this, but can only find solutions for previous versions of Note. Nearly all of them involve removing SD cards (obviously not an option with the Note 5) or changing sync options for media stored on the phone (I have no pictures, music, or videos on the phone.)Does anyone else have an experience with this problem? If so, how did you fix it? Is this something I can disable with Package Disabler? And if so, how would that affect my phone?
My verizon Note didn't come with any earphones. Did this happen to any of you guys? I bought my note from a verizon experience store yesterday, and i don't know why it didn't come with any earphones. Did any of you guys have the same problem?
I rooted and installed TWRP. Can I now install custom ROM's like CM or Resurrection Remix? Sorry if it's a dumb question I'm just curious
Note 5 Titanium Silver US Release Info I found a reddit post (I can't find it anymore) saying that they talked to a samsung rep. and found out the silver color will come to the US. So today I tried my luck and live chatted with a samsung rep. and I twisted his words into getting him to tell me if the US was getting the silver color. I then stated So to clairify, you are confirming that the titanium silver color will come to the US? He then replied, Yes it will have a release in the US but the information on a release date is not available yet. If anyone has anymore info on this subject, please post a comment. My contract is up mid-October and I hope they have the silver note 5 in the US by then.
Life Proof for Note 5? Hey all!!So a little background info:Ive been a heavy android user for the last 5 or so years, going from a Samsung Fascinate, to a Droid Incredible 2 to a Note 1, M7 and than Note 3. I loved Android but decided I wanted a change, so back in February I purchased an Iphone 6. Well it was a fun 8 months, but I missed Android so badly that I traded it in and bought a 64GB Note 5. It is an AMAZING device. But coming from the Iphone 6, there is (obviously) a lack of nice cases out. That's partly because of the recent release of the Note 5 and also the fact that there is a lack of an Apple logo on the back. I do a lot of hiking, out doorsy things and regularly fool around with my fish tank. One of the nice things about the Iphone is the ability to get a decent waterproof case. Something I fear is lacking on the android side. I know the S6 has a life proof which is a huge win on Android's side, but do you ever think we will get one for the Note 5? Obviously its selling better than more previous Notes, but is it enough for Lifeproof to spend money and time developing a case? Have there been any rumbles about one coming? When I owned the Note 3, I know Obex released a really shoddy waterproof case, and Im sure there are other options out there/coming, but Life Proof has always been one of the nice, higher tier waterproof cases.tldr Do you think the Note 5 will get a decent waterproof case from Life Proof?Also: Are there any cases that you guys recommend while I wait for a nice waterproof case? I prefer slim (The phone feels way to good) but I plan on reselling it in a year, so something really protective is important.
Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Rendered to have a 4K display [Concept Video] 
Smart Lock with bluetooth I usually have my bluetooth headphones on during my morning commute. I saw the Smart Lock feature and tried it out using the headphones as the trusted device, but instead of it turning off my usual fingerprint lock like it should, now whenever the headphones are connected when I turn on the screen I have to swipe to unlock AND right after the swipe it asks for my fingerprint instead of just unlocking with the swipe alone like it should. Anyone else have any troubles with Smart Lock or can help me?

What are your goto accessories? Hello all,  I'll be getting my Note in a few short weeks, but I was curious about what are some of the goto accessories that you people use?  Any recommendations would be awesome even down to smart watches and Bluetooth headphones. Also are there any things that I should make sure to avoid? I'm making the jump from an iPhone so help would be greatly appreciated.
Sticky note widget for S pen? Hi all, I'm looking for a widget I can put on one of my home screens that allows direct input with the S pen. So a widget that doesn't take me to an app, but allows for instant writing on a home screen sticky note. Does this exist? Searching turned up nothing. 
Screen isn't one of my battery processes...So how do I view my SOT and other screen stats? 
Retail stores with N5 cases?? Are there any retail stores that sell Note 5 cases, other than the Flip cover?  How does the flip cover work with the Note 5? I know on the S5 (my previous phone) I had to remove the backa nd use the flip cover back instead. 
Help! No equalizers work? Deleted a number of stock apps regarding music but no equalizer apps are working, what'sthedeal?
Note 5 problems I've experienced. I've had a Note 5 for nearly 2 weeks now, after having a Note 2 for almost 3 years, so I know that what I am experiencing is not normal...at least that's what I think.First, when the screen switches on, there is a  short delay before the time updates, so for a second or two I will be looking at the wrong time. This is a little annoying. It's been like that from the start. My wife has the same problem on her Note 5.Second, the 'cap' on the back of the s-pen fell off and easily pulls off after I reattached it. Sliding the pen out of the phone can sometimes pull it off and makes pulling the pen out difficult.Third, my music keeps glitching in the vanilla music app. It's the same music as I had on my Note 2, made up of mp3s and flac. I am now using another app and it seems fine, but one other downloaded music player also glitches.Is there something I can do about the software stuff? I will probably try get the pen replaced soon.
Is this normal on a note 5/amoled screen? See: edges of pictures on the black background particularly the NCIS background at the very top. 
Online reviews So I'm trying to decide between the 5 and the 4 like I'm sure many people are. Getting frustrated with inaccurate amazon etc reviews giving 1 star ratings because of things like no sd card or no removable battery. Get over yourself! You think you're important because you can go all over the Web 1 staring the device without even having bought the damn thing complaining about KNOWN features? Seriously? Yes, it doesn't have an sd card. Yes, it doesn't have a removable battery or back cover. Other things the note 5 doesn't have: a physical keyboard, a track pad, a USB 3.port, micro HDMI out, a free 3 month subscription to Google play, and it doesn't even have a fucking RCA dongle either. I mean really how dare they. How am I supposed to connect the camcorder to my CRT TV to watch my vacation videos from 1995?! 
Can you remove the S finder / Quick Connect from the notification panel? The S finder / Quick Connect buttons were present on the S6 edge notification panel but a recent update (5.1.1?) has made them easy to remove without root via the EDIT button up the top (I think - I haven't received the update yet). For those who have the Note 5 already, does it have the function to remove it already?Thanks!
Anyone else getting scroll lag? Never noticed this with my previous phones and didn't even notice it with the Note 5 till recently, but it seems as though scrolling in almost any application gives me stuttering or a perceived skipping feeling. I don't notice it as much when using the stylus and it only seems to do it with gradual movements down or up, but that's the speed I normally scroll so it's starting to drive me bonkers.I read at least on chrome you can try disabling javascript to alleviate it but that doesn't seem to have helped much. Again, this stuttering is happening across most apps. It's just weird as I used it for 1-2 weeks before even noticing it and now it seems a lot more pronounced. Anyone else experience this, possible workarounds to alleviate the lag?FWIW I did some benchmarks to see if everything was working properly and it all more or less matches up with other benches done for Note 5.
WiFi slower on my note 5 I just upgraded from the gs5 to the note 5 and now when I connect to my home WiFi, things load slower. Anyone else notice this or know how I can trouble shoot this? 
Why is top and bottom of lock screen lit up? 
Phone Freezing and Restarting While Connected to Wifi Whenever I connect my phone to the Wifi, it begins to behave very oddly and eventually freezing/restarting itself.  Have any of you run into this problem???  Also, has anyone come up with a fix for the fast charging issue? I rarely get fast charging when I plug in my phone (into the provided charger).Thanks!
How do I remove emails from autocorrect dictionary? I had more note 3 copied over to my note 5 and now it autocorrect emails I've never seen before.

Anyone use 802.1x (EAP-TLS) WiFi on their Note5? Any issues? I can't get my Note 5 to stay connected to my corporate WiFi. Didn't have any issues with the same setup on my Note 4.

Looking to move from an S5 to a Note 5 soon, can you guys show me some low-light photos and also the best picture you've taken with your Note 5? I like the camera on my S5 for the most part but the front facing camera is horrible and so are low-light photos. So I'd love to see not only some low light photos taken with your Note 5 but also I'd love to see the best picture you've taken with it! I'm excited to get a Note 5 soon! Also what is the best case to get? Thanks in advance!
Lock screen timer I changed the wallpaper of my lock screen and now the lock screen only stays on for about 1.5 seconds before the screen turns off again. And idea how to fix this?
Maybe a dumb question... but I need an answer! Is there anyway I can permanently turn off the LED back lights for the multi task and back soft keys.I hate playing a game and having the soft keys illuminate intermittently. So I would like to turn them off for good.Thank you in advance!
Question about Galaxy note Pro case (I know this is Note 5 sub, but hoping someone might have a suggestion!) Hello all! I just switched over from apple and love it with android. Fell in love with note 5 stylus and bought the tablet. I am a big fan of writing notes by hand, and decided to find a slim profile case instead of a keyboard case. I bought a leather moko case from amazon but it is kind of heavy (10oz). Does anyone know of a good protective slim case? Loving the note pro and stylus....I had bought a surface but returned it because the stylus sacked. Would love to find a good light slim case for hand writing notes on this tablet! Sorry for the odd request haha.Lastly, I just want to say I have been an apple fan boy all my life, and was nervous about switching to android for the note 5 (main reason for Gear VR)...but I have to say I am impressed with this operating system!!
Best case for protecting the note 5 from dust? I'm finally ready for my next phone and Im pretty sure I want to go from note 3 to note 5.  I've had no problems with my note 3.  I work in construction and my hands get pretty dirty.  I've used the defender otter box since day 1 on my note 3 and its been great.  My concern is with the note 5,  the case doesn't cover the home button,  and they have totally cheaped out and just left a cut out for the button in the plastic screen cover.  This will let all kinds of shit through and eventually fuck that button up will it not?  Anyone know of a case that doesn't turn the phone into a brick but actually provides protection pike otter box used to?
Note5 colors What color is everyone getting for the note 5? The white pearl or black sapphire?  I am leaning towards the white sapphire because it stands out more and the black is mostly blueish.
Lockscreen Is there any third party lockscreen that will show each notificiation and not collapse them. For example, right now if I get 5 new texts, on my lockscreen there will just be one bubble that says 5 new messages. Basically, I want lockscreen notifications like the iPhone. Thanks you
Very little heat while wireless charging? I've been using the standard Samsung wireless charger that came out when the S6 did and have noticed that the Note 5 barely gets warm while charging on it while the S6 Edge and Droid Turbo used to get uncomfortably hot on the back.  I recall Samsung saying they've improved the wireless charging on the Note 5, but I didn't think it would actually decrease the heat coming off the chargers I already have. And I could swear it charges faster on this thing than the S6 Edge did. Has anyone else noticed these improvements or am I just going crazy?
Battery drained from 43% to 0% overnight I just bought the Note5 a few days ago and I've  been loving it so far. Yesterday i went to sleep with the phone at 43% battery. I thought i would just charge it in the morning. When i woke up the phone was completely dead and i had to charge it to turn it back on. Theres no obvious app draining my battery and my connection at home is decent.  Has anybody had this issue? Im tempted to return the phone given its only been a few days and  im already having issues.Heres a screenshot of my battery usagehttp://imgur.com/NjGOq5O

Trade in 6P, for Note 5? So about one week ago I got my 6P and have had a pretty good except for one thing, the battery life. I only average about 2.5-3hr of SOT. I've been looking at getting a Note 5. Question is, would the experience with the Note 5 be any better then with the 6P. How does the battery life and performance compare to the 6P? 
Samsung Pay Beta Hey there,Just checking to see if anyone heard back from Samsung after signing up through the website I posted over on /r/Android last week.I haven't heard anything, have you?
Quick Charge 2.usb cable? Reading Qualcomm faqs it seems that quick charge 2.is independent of usb cable as long it's rate for usb 2.it should be able to charge at quick charge speeds.  However, according to wirecutter and various forums it seems that not all cables are created equal.I'm looking for a usb cable that's capable of providing a fast charge and has a thin/slim/compact micro usb head.  I've recently purchased Anker's premium cable I am happy with the purchase but it can't fit through the case I have on my Note.  The only cable that fits is the usb cable that came with it, but the problem is that I have a tendency of ripping the rubber portion of the connector.I was looking at monoprice's premium usb cable, but it doesn't appear to be 28/24 and apparently not able to provide quick charge speeds.Any recommendation would be greatly appreciated.

The Note lock screen is insanely slow unless using fingerprint... Any way to change? I am perfectly fine with using my fingerprint but it makes smart lock when connected to a Bluetooth device completely useless because of how slow the standard lock screen is. Is there seriously no way to change the lock screen animation? I've already sped up the device animations in dev settings... Doesn't  seem to help. 
Notification Issues Sorry if this has already been addressed elsewhere, but when I am connected to WiFi a bunch of my notifications won't come through until I unlock my phone or click the the home button. I have a feeling that it is a WiFi/ router issue, but I do not know for sure. Does anyone know why this happens or how to fix it (or if it can be fixed)?

FYi - The S-Pen can get stuck the correct way too. Just like the title says, my s-pen is stuck in my phone the correct way.  I have never inserted the phone the wrong direction.  I pulled it out of my pocket the other day and went to take a note, but the s-pen wouldn't budge.  [Pic for reference.](http://i.imgur.com/secxPHz.jpg)I tried clicking down on it with some different items, but it's stuck.  I thought about trying the paper trick that works for pens stuck backwards, but it won't fit around the stylus the correct way.  at&ampt won't warranty it and I'm talking to Samsung now to see if they will.edit - Samsung is repairing it, i assume at no cost. Ill be shipping it off for a week or so. 
Screen briefly flickers before the animation begins when I hit the power button to turn the screen off. This only happens every now and then, but it's really bugging me.  I like the 1x animation scale as it makes the phone feel smoother.  I've rebooted but it keeps happening.  Any ideas?  This is the ONLY hiccup the phone has for me.  Otherwise I love it.  I guess I might be obsessing a bit.

Setting up Google Voice as VM Provider Just got a Note 5 on Sprint and am loving it so far. Problem is I've been a Google Voice user for well over 5 years and I cannot get it to work on the phone. I've tried to enable it in the Phone settings, but everytime I go to Voicemail settings it goes to the stock Voicemail program (which looks ridiculous) how do I disable the stock voicemail and get Google Voice going?
Had Note5 less than a month, have Screen Burn, need help. So i got my Note5 about 3 weeks ago and ive been using it pretty actively.  I tend to look at my phone pretty often.  I noticed about a week ago i was starting to get screen burn from my desktop icons.  Im using a theme with light blue icons like in the header on this reddit.  I notice when i goto any solid color screen on my phone i can see the icons still.  Is there any reliable way to fix this?  Is it a defect?  Should i return the phone?  I think on the 11th is my 30s days to return the phone, but i do have insurance also on it.I like the note5 but if screenburning was going to be an issue, they should mention that.  its crazy to think i got burn in in less than a month of ownership.  To compare, i have my old phone, which is a HTC Droid DNA that has been on 99% of the time ive owned it for the past 3 years.  I never turn it off, i never lock the screen, it doesnt goto sleep.  ( used it heavilly all the time for various things, so i disabled the screen sleep).  But i have Zero burn ins on this phone that has been on for over 90days straight.  Why is a phone ive had 24 days already burning with a fraction of the use??  Anyways, if you guys know anything or tips let me know.  I dont want to return it if i dont have to, but if this is indeed a defect then ide like to know.EDIT: [This is the desktop in question that burned icons on screen](http://i.imgur.com/KrGq1KM.jpg)  its pretty silly how that burned the screen...
Yellowish screen? I just received my note 5 and the whites look more yellowish than normal. Is it supposed to be that way? It's also my first amoled screen and im coming from the G3 which had cooler whites *more blue* so i'm not really sure if its an issue with the screen or if i'm not used to amoled screens...

People who upgraded to Note 5 from other Notes, What is the best Note in your opinion? I was so looking to buy a Note this time, but went with the G4 because I love SD card and Removable battery. I might get myself a note in future, but it might not be Note 5. Thinking of getting a Note 4 or Note 3. What do you guys suggest? 5, 4, or 3?
[Rogers] Android OS using double the battery of my screen. What gives? Problem showed up a few days ago, my battery is getting murdered by Android OS which seems to be a steady draw regardless of the phone being locked or in use. I'm assuming this was some sort of update that fucked the utilization of Android OS? Restarting the phone does not help. 
Looking to get Note 5 in the UK Howdy, I'm looking to grab a Note 5 Black Sapphire and I am currently in the UK.I would require it to be capable of connecting to Three 4G without issues, preferably a version that is rootable, and already unlocked.

Anyone's phone screen getting scratched easily? I got one on release day and babied it (no case) and it developed a very small scratch.Received a new phone, they were out of cases, babied the shit out of it, and it has two bigger scratches.  Both under 24 hours.... I've never had this problem with any phone before.This happening to anyone else?  Is everyone buying screen guards?
Am I SOL? My volume down button is permanently stuck. After I had to reboot the phone, the phone gets stuck on the T-Mobile Screen. I'm guessing it has something to do with volume down being permanently pressed. Any help would be appreciated. I already tried rebooting into recovery (vol up + home + power), but it won't let me do so since it thinks volume down is pressed. I can't access the phone via USB or ADB and no dice. Replacement is already coming in a week due to button issue, but I at least was hoping for a functional device until then. I'm guessing I'm SOL?
Spen is defective...replacement options? I contacted Samsung about getting my Spen replaced. At first it was simply that the clicker would get stuck, but now the touch screen doesn't respond to the pen at all. They said that between sending mine in a getting a new one back, I would be without a pen for a week, and I can't do that. So I need a replacement pen, but most of the pens on amazon and ebay are shady at best. Does anyone have experience replacing their Spen?
Headphone port/jack not quite working? Title pretty much. I have the 64gb AT&ampT variant, using a pair of Shure SE215 and my earbud of choice. It works perfectly fine until you go and turn the headphone jack or whatever you call the part that you stick into the phone, and the phone gives me an earphones connected prompt in the status bar. Extremely annoying since my music will cut with the slightest touch :c does anyone have any suggestions?Sorry on mobile I don't know how to flare ._.
PMA Charging? I am hopefully picking up a Note 5 tomorrow, I just returned my S6 Edge to get it. Along time ago I got the duracell PMA wireless charger for dirt cheap, I have used it with Galaxy s6 and my edge recently, its a pain in the butt to charge with but I leave it in the office and it works ok. I cant find anywhere in the specs if the Note 5 will support PMA like the s6 and the s6 edge does. Anyone know?
Touch randomly stops working on screen. So randomly when I wake my phone up from 'sleep' or when the screen is off it won't respond to my touch. The buttons on the bottom respond to touch just fine, but anywhere on the screen nothing happens when I touch it. I have to keep pushing the power button to turn it off and on again until it finally will respond to my touch. Any ideas? Is my phone just messed up?
Note 5 or S6 Edge+? My contract finally ended and now i'm finally able to upgrade to a new phone but I am having a very tough debate to either obtain the Note 5 or S6 Edge+. The only Samsung device I've ever bought was the S3 and I've moved to Sony and Nexus after that. So what are your opinions on which one I should get? P.S. I have no experience with any Note devices :)
Because of people inserting their S-Pens backwards, Samsung has revoked all warranty availability relating to the S-Pen according to my local Samsung-licensed repair center. [This](https://imgur.com/xqkT5jq) is therefore not covered under warranty. Like, what the hell? It's pretty clearly a defect, and the phone's warranty is supposed to cover included accessories, so I don't understand why I can't get a replacement. I've been to two separate service centers and both have said the same thing. Calling Samsung just results in them telling me to take it a service location.
[PSA] Steelie magnetic phone mount stops S pen from working. Thought my phone was broken and was about to take it in, but decided to remove the magnet mount and low and behold the pen works again!The steelie I have won't let the pen write on the screen in an inch wide circle in the middle of the screen. The screen detects the pen, but it won't write. Tried this on a Note 2 and the steelie doesn't effect the pen at all.Figured I'd post this incase anyone else is thinking of buying one.
Note 5 at tmobile Tmo takes 10off Samsung phones. For a note 5 64GB, if I use Apple Pay to pay in full in a Tmo store: 680-14(20% Apple Pay)- 5(Samsung rebate)+4tax= 530. 20more than G4 (325 before tax). Is it worth it? Or better go for a G4? Thank you!
Backwards spen sensor repair So my idiot friend broke my spen sensor by pretending to put in the pen backwards. He said he would pay for the repair, any idea if Samsung would repair this and how much it would cost? I bought my phone through Wind Mobile in Canada if that makes a difference (I'm assuming I have to go through the carrier for the repair).
S pen -&gt desktop When I am in bed, I like to set my phone down and pull out the s pen. I can do anything I want without physically touching my phone except I have not figured out how to go to the home screen without having to push the home screen button (which requires a finger push).  Does anyone know a way?
Note 5 only responding to stylus, no finger input Very VERY frustrating.  Phone is not a few months old and all of a sudden it starts randomly not responding to finger input.  Based on some suggestions, we already turned off WiFi, same problem. We also just discovered today that when it gets in that state, it only seems to respond to the stylus.  In some limited searching I have done, it seems that this is not an isolated issue.  What gives??In any event, besides replacing the phone, is there any fix for this???
Fast Charging Issues I'm getting tired of having to plug my phone in 2times in a row to get to fast charging with my charger I got with the phone. Has anyone been able to get a replacement or find out if its a problem with the phone or the charger? I'm not seeing much progress quickly browsing other forums.Edit: I've been using my chromecast cable now for a while and it works like a charm
Anyone else's S pen go flying out if they drop their phone? [deleted]
Not receiving links in mms My friend was trying to send a Facebook link to me and I didn't receive it at all. I had them try sending random url like YouTube and got nothing as well. Using stock messaging app and also tried textra but still nothing. Didn't see anything in package disable that would explain this. Anyone else?
Toggle LTE AT&ampT Note 5 Is it possible to toggle LTE on the AT&ampT model? The place I would normally go to look on my old Nexus doesn't have any options. The few widget apps I tried didn't work either. 
Will there be a gear VR designed for the Note 5? I find it strange that the Note 5 doesn't have a gear VR available yet. Has there been any news about if/when it will be coming?
5 Reasons Not To Buy The Samsung Galaxy Note 5 **This is a serious thread only. Read this, if you are not willing to buy Note5**. This thread is not meant to be a hate-thread, i am just listing some big features that are removed from Note 5.------**MicroSD:**There are no SD-Card slot. There were rumors about the Chinese, Korean market having an SD-card slot but nothing was announced. Even if it is announced, don't expect them to work with NA LTE.------**Battery:**2k screen with a super screen size phone, but with only 3k battery size? Not to mention, it is a non-removable battery.------**Space:**There is no SD-Card support which is already a con. Now there are no model for 128GB storage! [Source](https://twitter.com/dcseifert/status/632180891197042688). Samsung website also removed the 128GB option for Edge+ and Note 5. Not to mention, all the software with TouchWiz will probably take up 20GB of space :(------**IR blaster:**While Note 5 is missing many feature, i am also sad that this is getting removed too. I don't know why but with me having an S5 (not everday phone), i use my S5 often to control my TV sometimes (my S5 is linked with my (PVR + TV).------**Price:**32GB for a base model starting at $70(which is okayish for new phone), I live in Canada so i am expecting around $800+ for base model. But for such price, there are other flag-ship phones that offer more features than Note 5 (*cough*/ Galaxy Note 4) or you can go with the cheaper alternative design like Galaxy S6 or edge.------Galaxy Note series is supposed to be the most premium and superior phone out of all. Each Note supposed to suppress the previous design. While Note 5 have some good features and design, i don't think it is enough to purchase Note 5 with such price and I am much happier with my Note 4.If you are type of person who would likes to purchase new phone with premium design, new feature (check other sticky thread) and OP specs, then this is the phone for you. If you like space, battery life then this isn't the phone for you. While Note 5 does have much efficient TouchWiz that will extend the battery life, the lack of non-removable battery looses many people interest.
A G4 vs Note 5 camera comparison Here's two flickr albums I put together. One of them is pictures from my G4 and one is from my Note 5. They aren't the exact pictures but similar and you can see from both phones what I've shot. Also full res too.

Which smart watch do you guys use? Hey all, long time lurker. I was wondering if any of you use a smart watch. I'm looking to get the original moto 36because its cheap now. Any others I should consider or any advice on how you guys use yours? 
[NOTE 5] How to use Home button to unlock, rather then Swipe screen? I find it pretty annoying that I first have to press the home or power button to wake the device and then swipe the screen to unlock.I remedied this by using the fingerprint sensor, and lock the device instantly after screen timeout, but is there any way around this?I wish I could just press the home button to wake the device and go straight to the phone instead of getting to the swipe to unlock screen.  
Low quality thumbnails? Anyone else seeing really [low quality thumbnails](http://i.imgur.com/cyI4auy.jpg) on their phone? As soon as I click on the link the picture is fine, but the thumbnails are really annoying. Is this normal? It happens on any site as far as I can tell. 
Anybody having audio issues with Youtube App while using headphones? Sometimes the audio will shift back and forth from normal audio to audio that sounds like it was recorded in empty room(reverbish/echoish effect). I've tried with multiple headphones/headsets and same effect. This is for confirmation if its the app itself or if my adapter is faulty. Other apps with audio works fine.

Dropped Calls? So I have had my Note 5 for 1days and I've absolutely loved it more than any other phone I've had.  Unfortunately on 4 separate occasions today, my call was dropped.  All four people reported hearing two blank spaces, followed by a crashing sound and then I was disconnected.  I used my phone a lot for work and this could be a real problem.Is this a known issue?Edit: I'm on verizon

My battery life on day 1 [deleted]
has anyone bought one of those external note 5 battery cases? They can be found on ebay or amazon. All from China. Obviously not as reliable as zerolemon (THEY NEED TO HURRY UP). But has anyone bought one of these? And what other external battery cases companies should I eagerly wait for? 
Quality of life issues: let's round 'em up here I'm sure we all have some minor issues that get on our nerves. I love this phone and consider it the best one out right now, however there are some minor things I wish could be changed-- if anyone has a solution to these problems, let me know!Feel free to post your own. Here's mine:* Notification volume is not linked to Ringtone volume.This is annoying. I wish there was an option to make them be the same all the time.* Bluetooth no longer automatically connects to paired devices upon turning on Bluetooth. It used to on my old phones.* No way to turn off 'multi-view'. The only time I ever use multi-view is by accident and it's frustrating when I accidentally activate it.* Okay Google usage from the lock screen isn't fully supported. If you have it activated and say Okay Google it'll make the noise and start listening for your command, but the lock screen timeout is not paused and it'll shut off the screen before you even finish saying anything-- making this whole feature useless from the lock screen.

Android 5.1.1 update. Is this new or am i behind in updating? 
YouTube app doesn't play 60fps videos My youtube app on my Galaxy Note 5 doesn't play 60fps videos in 60fps. It does, however, play 1440p videos, and they look fantastic! Is this a common issue with newly released devices? Is there a workaround in the meantime?
Wallpaper Motion Effect Anyone else notice that there's still some icon motion on the home screen, even if you turn it off? How do I completely kill it. Wanting a static screen like always.
Goodbye Note 5 - Hello Nexus 6P :( Well, it took about a month. I simply can't take it anymore.TL:DR Up front - I'm Pissed at my Shitty Battery Galaxy Note 5 on ATT and I bought a Nexus 6P.That being said - so, I bought the Note 5. I took it home, put my SIM in it, let Google sync all my contacts and apps and all that business. I set up all my accounts and apps, fixed all the background refresh settings, etc, etc, etc. The same thing all the rest of you do. I went to bed, plugged the phone in. Woke up, restarted it for good measure on the charger, and went to work. This was a Friday morning. Now, I should tell you, I'm a standby phone user. I have a cellular iPad that I do most of my browsing on, and my phone is basically a text / work email / boredom device. So for me, it needs to work when I need it to work, but SOT and game performance, etc, are not really my personal benchmark. I need the phone to not eat it's own battery when it's sitting on the desk doing nothing. YMMV. So anyways, I glance at the phone SUNDAY afternoon and it still has 40% of battery remaining. I was like... mindblown. What a great phone!So a day later, ATT pushes 5.1.1. Like an idiot, I downloaded it. So begins the saga of the Note 5 replacement. The battery life was INSTANTLY for shit. I noticed it 1minutes after updating the phone. It was draining (still is) at a rate of about 2-4% / hour with location services off. I have done everything I can think of. PDP, Greenify, Every Setting on the phone (I don't want to root because I actually like Samsung Pay at old-fashioned terminals). I've turned off every damn thing with PDP to the point that basically nothing works on the phone. (Which you shouldn't have to do to make the battery last more than 1 day). I have now turned off Google Location history and Google Now (which are the two MAIN reasons I stay with Android, FFS!) and it still isn't making a difference. With all of that done it still drains 1-3% / hour at idle on wifi sitting still on a desk.No matter what I do, the phone burns up to 4% / hour on **nothing**. I even uninstalled Facebook, Instagram, The Score, Bleacherreport, all of it. It just smokes the battery because Samsung. Actually, probably more like, because ATT. So to make matters worse, I went in and bought an iPhone 6s+. This was a terrible idea. The standby battery on the iPhone is completely ass broken. That phone, if you don't pick it up and screw with it, will hold charge and lose like 1-2% OVERNIGHT. That's like quarters of a percent per hour. I sleep 5-6 hours and the phone loses 1-2%. My standby benchmark happy ass was thrilled. But I had a faulty iPhone. The one that completely freezes up when you unlock with TouchID. I think it's because the phone is coming out of battery-saver mode, but some other peoples phones didn't do it, and I'm way too OCD to have that problem so I returned it. I also didn't want to have TWO monthy payment contracts running especially 12 months from now when it's time to NEXT my new ATT phone, which at this point will probably be an iPhone because FUCK Samsung and ATT. And fuck Samsung for not telling ATT where they can shove it about touching every ROM and filling it with bullshit. ANYWAYS - I ordered a Nexus 6P today so that when my contract runs I am not paying for a phone I won't be using. I'm pretty much done with Samsung. It's a shame. This is a really nice phone. It's fast, and the new S-Pen is pretty freaking amazing. But I cannot, simply cannot stand the for-shit battery life this phone has for no reason. I've factory wiped and hard-wiped the device and cache twice. There's no way around it. It just eats itself. The camera is THE SHIT, I'm sad to have to let it go, I know the Nexus won't be the same, hopefully it will be close. So, I'm done crying now, I just needed to get this out because I'm pissed. Thanks for listening.
Backordered my @$$! So like tons of others, I frequently got the dreaded... Backordered for my wireless chargers. Of course my wallet cover came like a week ago, but I had given up hope of ever seeing these things!I notice a FedEx truck drove slowly away from my house about 5 seconds ago. I thought... there's no way that could have been my house. Anyways, on my front porch sits two packages addressed to me!? Low and behold, I got 1 white and 1 blue of the wireless chargers. Fantastic!
Sidesync audio goes through PC, any way to turn this off? Sidesync is great but having to swap my headset between my phone and my PC is really killing the convenience of it all. Can I somehow prevent it from rerouting audio to my PC?
Note 5 on Samsung Wireless Charger picking up pushes that aren't happening When I put my Note 5 on the wireless charger it acts like I pressed the app switcher button when I didn't... or the home button sometimes (rare-er than the app switcher button). Especially when I simply set the phone down with the screen on and on a particular app and go to turn off the screen. My fingers are no where near the buttons but they register like I touch them.Not rooted or anything. Just got the phone today and I don't think I will root, for once. I love the phone.
This camera is unreal. 
What's with the over processing on the front camera? It always touches up the photo. Almost like a blur effect in photo shop. It's terrible and fake looking. Is there any way to turn this off?
S-Note has stopped - Package Disabler Pro issue? Hey all, so I went through PDP and disabled a bunch of stuff that other posts/threads have marked as bloatware and now I am getting an S-Note has stopped popup pretty regularly (several times a day). Searching for anything related to S-Note hasn't yielded any clear offenders so... any ideas what I disabled to cause this issue?
Restricting background data for individual applications Hi all, I've looked around quite a bit on my phone and don't see an option to restrict the background data for individual applications. I see the option to restrict all background data, but it seems that restricting individual background data is no longer possible.On my old Galaxy S4, this option was under the Data Usage menu and would allow me to restrict the data of specific apps by tapping on the app and its usage. There would be a button on the page for the specific data usage for an app that allowed me to make the choice.This is really pissing me off because I only want it on for apps like Facebook Messenger so that I can still be notified if I receive messages.Thanks for any help.
Messaging issue Hi all,I've had an att Note 5 for almost three weeks and I love. Fantastic device. Only issue, I'm coming from an iPhone and most of my friends and family are also iPhone users. I'm not receiving texts by some people. I've deactivated imessage and changed my ios password and followed the recommended steps from apple and elsewhere that I've found online to no avail. Group texts don't work, as in some can't see my replies and I can't see most of theirs, across several different groups. I've had some tell me that sending me messages is a pain as well, most of them stalling on their end and never sending out. Has anyone experienced this? I don't think it's an issue with my note but probably their iPhones and imessage being all weird, but at this point it may be easier to try and exchange the note for another iPhone, as I've tried everything on my end to no avail. Thanks!
Music on SD card question So using a USB to USB cable and a USB Microsoft card reader I am able to access my 32 gig SD card with my music library on it from when I had the note 4 (got upgraded because mine broken and 4s were no longer available, but wouldn't give me a 64 gig model understandably)  the only thing is that I can only play music from the my files app. Music player doesn't load any in inherently. Is there a way to fix this, as browsing music in my files is pretty annoying. Edit: Proamp is able to read from the SD card instantly. I still prefer Samsung music player but Proamp is great and does what I need
How big is the system memory partition on your Note 5? Hi all,I went to see the Note 5 in a local Telus shop here in Canada. One of the things I checked is the storage usage which indicated that of the 32 GB total space, 15 GB was used as the system memory.From what I see around the Web, it's supposed to vary between 7 and 8 GB, depending on the carrier I would guess.Do you have any idea why their demo unit would have 15 GB in its system memory? The only app Telus puts on their device (supposedly) is the one to manage our Telus account.Do the system memory partition grows over time with OS updates ? I've never used an Android phone before.Since the 32 GB is the only option available in Canada, I was worried a little when I saw that half of it was already used by the system on their demo unit. At the same time, I'm wondering if it's only a quick on their demo.
Fast charging takes 2.5 hours? I upgraded from the Note 4 and my other phone is an S6 Edge so I have multiple fast chargers. The wierd part is that all except one (not the one that it came with either) keep it at exactly the same percentage whether Im using the phone or not. But they work perfectly with my other phones so obviously they aren't the issue. Then the one that does work with the 5 takes about 2.5 hours to charge. And no the fast charging feature isn't turned off. Has anyone else had the same issue with the fast charging taking forever?
Note 5/S6 Fingerprint sensor detection speed?? I've noticed that with the note 5 and I'm assuming s6 as well that the lockscreen has to load when you click the home/power button which slows the whole process of getting into the phone quickly . Is there anyway to disable it and take you straight to the home screen when your finger is scanned? This is why the iPhone 6s is so fast . Once it detects your finger has been on the sensor for long enough it bypasses the lockscreen altogether.
What music/media transfer application would you recommend for connecting a Mac to the GN5? I'm currently test driving a Galaxy Note 5 through the Ultimate Test Drive program (coming from an iPhone 4S) and am enjoying the responsiveness and multitasking capability compared to an iOS device.However, I'm stumped as to the best way to manage music/media transfer. I tried using Android File Transfer, but having it installed breaks SideSync (it won't connect to the device.)What would you recommend as the easiest way to transfer music and media (videos/photos) to and from a Mac? I know there are cloud-based solutions (Google Play Music/ownCloud/etc.), but I'd be concerned about the amount of data that would be consumed.(USB-based solutions would be best.)Thanks in advance!
amazing battery life 
Note 5 battery issues. For two days I've noticed my battery has been draining. I've contacted Samsung via twitter and they are hard to work with. Any idea why Google play services is using so much power?http://imgur.com/YKiyZkH
Battery help So I've had the n5 for 2 weeks and I battery is meh. I normally keep my phone off charge at night and seem to lose 20% over night. To me that seems a little much what are others experiencing over night?
Questions about viewing angles and color shift. So I got my Note 5 a few days ago and set everything up. My only issue now is noticing that moving the device in different angles I notice a rainbow like pattern (extreme angles mostly). I noticed it on my S4 as well but it wasn't as noticeable. Is this normal? I don't want to have to replace my device because of such a silly issue. Could this just be due to the pixel density at 1440p and the AMOLED screen?http://i.imgur.com/NeDfQYI.jpgLooks worse than it is on camera.If I do get a replacement from Verizon will it be a brand new device? Or refurbished? It says on the site if it's been more than 15 days after purchase I would get a like-new phone as a replacement but since it's been less than 15 does that mean it would be brand new? The wording is very weird. Under 1 year = No cost replacement, 15+ Days from purchase = Like-New. &lt15 Days= ???
Can you change the volume rocker function? Is there any way to change the volume rocker so that it controls media volume by default?
AT&ampT Note 5 software update happening now Anyone know what is included?  I just got the notification and my device is downloading it now.  I was on the July build of the AT&ampT version, if I see what is in this update after it finishes coming through I will update this post.UPDATE:  It finished in about 2minutes and never did tell me what was being changed or updated.People are reporting the same thing on other android sites around the web.  Why AT&ampT wouldn't want to scream to the heavens they are doing an update, I don't know, it seems it would benefit them.
OK to use Motorola car charger? Got the Note 5 a few weeks ago, love it. Can I use my current car charger with it? Its one I got at Wal-Mart, and they seemed to be labeled according to the brand, even though the charger itself appears to be generic. I'd hate to damage the batteries at all.
Video not working As of this morning videos not playing. Not the video from youtube,  not the video downloaded from YouTube, not the ones I made,  not the ones on Facebook.Using my Note 3 on WiFi everything is fine. What's your best guess?
New Verizon Owner. Messaging preferences? I've been a Galaxy owner since the original S series 5-6 years ago.  Owned a Note 4 until today, now own a Note 5.  Today is also the first time I've ever been a Verizon Wireless customer.Do any VZW guys use the Verizon messaging app, or did you still go with stock Samsung or Textra?  Why or why not?
Screen protector that only covers the screen and not the whole front? I have a dbrand skin on the front and I'm looking for a screen protector that only covers/protects the screen and not the whole front of the phone. I haven't been able to find one yet.
Led notification question Why is there only an option to either have the LED notification light on for everything, such as phone notifications and charging. I don't particularly want LED notifications for anything but charging. 
Note 5 WiFi battery drain issue I have the Note 5 N920C international variant and after receiving the AOJ5 update my battery life has gone to nexus 5 levels. I am getting max of 3hrs of SOT and the battery will drop 30-40% overnight. Android System is draining most of the battery after Screen. After some rooting and custom kernels I installed the wakelock detector and [this is what's happening under the hood](http://imgur.com/a/43TPF). I noticed that when wifi is off the phone will last considerably longer. Anyone else having the same issue? Edit: unfortunately the dhcp method didn't give any noticeable improvement.
Battery life absolute toss? I got my note 5 on launch day and now using a huawei watch connected via bluetooth and knox my battery falls from 100% at 7 to 30% at noon. Am I just asking to much from a flagship phone?

Play Services -24available for download (supports Android Pay) 
Note 5 Software Update - impressions X post from r/Android My wife and I just just received the first update for our 32GB Rogers Note 5's, which was about 56meg in size. So far, after living with the update for about 24 hours I can say that the phone definitely has shed a lot of its jankiness and feels just a tad more responsive. It's not as smooth as my Nexus 5 running M Preview 3 but it's noticeably better than before. Multitasking also seems to be improved in that the task killer seems to be more lenient than the version that shipped at launch. Overall I'm much happier with the device.  Oh, and the build we're on is LMY47X.N920W8VLU1AOI1.  It also looks like the  kernel was updated as well, with one that has a Friday September 4th build date:3.10.61-5388899.Feel free to AMA is you want me to run specific tests. 
Sorry if this has been brought up before Hello!I have been a lifelong Iphone user. However, I saw that samsung is doing an awesome offer for me to ditch the iphone. http://promo.samsungpromotions.com/nopayments/Its a hard deal to turn down. Anyway, I was wondering what some advantages would be for the note 5 over my iphone 6+?  I know it has a bigger screen and better resolution but is there any other major upgrades?  I am also very interested in VR and I think I heard of a VR headset for android. Anyway thanks for any info!
What's On My Android | Note 5 (VIDEO) 
Any audiophiles care to comment on audio quality? Seriously considering this phone but I use my phone to listen to music a lot, HTC One M7 currently. How's the audio on the Note 5? UM Pro 3headphones is what I have.
Launchers on the Note 5 What is everyone using? I like the changeable grid size and how TouchWiz is more customizable now. I have bought nova prime in the past,and Google launcher looks interesting. I've just never liked the idea of TouchWiz running under another launcher,even if there aren't any widgets running.
Had a question about the Note 5 and whether it was region locked I got my Note 3 two years back and well, while I love the phone, I got a little unlucky with it. I got mine from Saudi Arabia and had to unlock it. Even though it's supposed to be an international phone, Samsung decided to impose region locks on it. I had to unlock it here in Bangladesh and in the process, I lost 3G all together. I had to use 2G for the past two years. I got used to it but damn, Samsung did screw me over here. It was also probably the shops fault where I got it unlocked from but still, there shouldn't be any region locks on  an international model. I'm planning on getting the Note 5 from Saudi Arabia once again as its cheaper there than here in Bangladesh and just wanted to know. Does Samsung still have the region locks on it? I really don't want to have a phone like that and not be able to use 3G at the bare minimum, we won't have 4G for some time. Anyone know about this?
Wireless Super Charger  Blinking Blue Light!! I was wondering if anyone has the issue with the wireless charging base always blinking blue. I've come to the point that it will always start blinking about 30-6seconds after it appears and goes wireless super charging enabled then when the light starts ... wireless charging paused.Any fixes? I have a outer box on the phone, but it was working most of the time when I first got it.
Anybody got Sidesync working over USB? The notification window opens ok but the actual screen just says Connecting... forever. Win 8.
Anyone using a Mophie juice pack/battery case? What's your review of it? I'm referring to this one here: http://uk.mophie.com/shop/samsung-devices/juice-pack-note-5Tried looking for online reviews but ~~can't find even one!~~ can only find an unboxing video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEptOI-vG5oExactly how thick is it? How's the grip? Is it any different from other similar-looking Note 5 battery pack out there?
T-Mobile Software Update Anyone else get am update this morning? I'm now on N920TUVU2COI5, no changelog from T-Mobile yet. The update text mentioned Samsung Pay, and I had an update for the beta once it installed and restarted. Still can't add all my cards yet....
Android Auto problem: solved I have a Pioneer 4100nex in my car.  Android Auto is awesome.  A few weeks ago, my phone and head unit stopped communication via android auto.  I was still able to use the usb for media playback, and Bluetooth worked fine.  Just the extra features of Android Auto would not work.  I reset the deck, I reset the phone.  I pulled the deck and reestablished all the connections and nothing worked.  My brother's S6 worked just fine with it.  I went to Sprint and they basically told me too fucking bad, which really pissed me off, but hey.  My phone is like two months old.What I thought was an unrelated problem, my lost stylus.  I ordered a new one and when I put it in, my phone started working with android auto again.  So fuck Sprint, and if you don't have your stylus in, there may be some interface issues with other devices.  FYI.
Waterproof cases? Looking at getting a Note 5. Have the Note 2, love it, but its time to upgrade. Otterbox told me today that they have no plans to make a waterproof case for the model, why on earth not, I have no clue. Does anyone currently have, or have tested in the past, a good waterproof case? I'm to put the money down and I'm not looking for some cheap crap that will break on me.
Some odd issues and questions 1- I think my brightness sensor is saturating... Every once in awhile it seems to get stuck at the minimum brightness. Moving the slider up and down while in Auto doesn't change the screen brightness AT ALL. Once I expose the sensors at the top to VERY bright light it seems to clear. Possibly faulty phone?2 - The phone vibrates when I pick it up, only briefly, and only once in awhile. Does anyone know why it does this? It does this whether I have notifications pending or not and it trips me out hard.3 - This is just a rant... Really Samsung, the alarm clock default app has a 3 snooze max and then it shuts off? Ugh, thanks for making me late to work a few times before I realized what was happening.
Samsung Pay and Magnet for Car Mount Hello, Wondering if anyone has had any success or issues with using Samsung Pay when theyhave a magnet on their phone for mounting purposes. I'd imagine the MST would be affected by an magnet, but would like to know for sure. thanks!
Don't be stupid, don't stick spen in backwards! Fml hopefully tmobile can replace it...
Metal s-pen? I'm assuming there isn't one since I can't find it, but does anyone know of a metal s-pen? I can't help but feel like I'm going to snap this one in half when I'm writing. It just feels like cheap plastic.Edit: if someone was able to make one I would pay a premium price for it. 
is there any way to save voicemails to the phone as opposed to just my carriers voicemail service? Not seeing anything in the app store. 
Screen off notes do not sync with evernote. Any other app usefulness? If I take a note on the screen off, I want it to get on my homescreen somehow.Other action notes sync immediately with evernote which goes on my widget on the home screen.Any ideas or other apps that work well with it?

Note 5 -- Cyanogenmod? Anyone know if someone is porting CM to out note devices? I don't know if this is a WIP or devs just see it as a device not worth it...
Additional lenses for the camera? I recently got the note 5, and was wondering if there was any lenses that fit on to the camera. All I can seem to find are iPhone lenses or am I just looking in the wrong place?
What is the real story on battery life? Coming from an iPhone 5S Sorry if you've heard this one before! I've been scouring message boards up and down for a good answer on this. Obviously, since we all use phones differently, everyone will have different results as to their battery. I either read that it's horrible or that people overexaggerate it and that the battery life is decent, and you'll have to basically charge up mid day.I use Facebook and Instagram for work, and do take lots of photos at night (I work at a popular sip 'n paint). The camera on the Note 5 just looks amazing and perfect for what I need. I really don't have any use for iOS anymore as everything I do revolves around Google.I'm tempted to wait to see if they actually do release a Note 5 Active, but at the same time I don't know if the battery will make up or any other lost functionality (I imagine it would...I never use the fingerprint reader on my iPhone).I'm also wondering if the Nexus 6P would be a good idea if its battery will be good, but the camera worries me. Thanks for any thoughts in advance!Edit: I should also note that I'm on AT&ampT.
Signal seems really bad compared to my Nexus 6 Hello there, I'm coming from a Nexus 6 to a Note 5. It's been about 2 weeks now and the phone is great but I am having a real issue with signal loss in work. Now the signal has never been that great to begin with but I've NEVER had any problems sending and receiving text's until now. It seems my signal is -105 5 asu in the signal strength department in settings and I downloaded real signal and most of the time its sitting at 0. for LTE sometimes it'll say 6 for HSUPA and now it went to HSPAP and I have no idea what the difference is but I do know that this is pissing me off. I'm out of the 14 day return policy but I may try and go in to get an exchange to see if it's the device because I can't be having this. Has anyone else noticed a difference in the signal coming from their old phone to their Note 5? I was thinking the case might have something to do with it but I've tried it on and off and there was no difference.I'm really annoyed blah.
Something funny I've noticed the past few days... Everyone is posting screenshots of what they've disabled in package disabler and they have massive albums, some even 13 images.[Wouldn't it be cool if Samsung invented a feature that would enable scrolling capture....](http://i.imgur.com/Igw163i.jpg)
Note5 super heavy duty cases Hey guys, just looking for a good heavy duty case for the note5, I've been looking at the NuNu waterproof case for the camera protector, and was wondering if there were other cases that had a camera lens protector too. i work on construction sites a lot and im just worried that if i drop it i might scratch the lens on a rock or someting ps bonus if they ship to australia )
When looking at firmwares, what do MYM and XID mean? See the link below:http://samsung-firmware.org/model/SM-N9208/I just purchased the Note 5 Duos (SM-N9208), and I'm not sure if I'll need to get a firmware from a different region.  If I do, which one would I use?  I'm in the US and I use TMobile.
Pics of Skinomi matte skin and Samsung flip wallet case http://imgur.com/a/pI5jvHere's a small gallery of these two products for anybody who might be interested in them and wants to see what they look like.I got a matte Skinomi skin to prevent scratches and fingerprints from gunking up the back. It looks quite nice but the fit could be better. The in hand feel reminds me of matte polycarbonate.The flip wallet is also quite nice, but I'm unsure of how the flap will hold up over time.
Phone doesn't fast charge After having tried 7 different Samsung fast chargers, 2 of them specifically from Note 5 boxes, and I've come to the conclusion that this phone won't fast charge. When I plug it in it just says charger connected in the notification bar and takes about 3 hours to fully charge. It's a Sprint phone, not sure if that makes a difference. I've looked through the settings but didn't find a way to turn the fast charging on. Am I missing something here? Is there a setting to enable it? Or did Sprint block that on their models?
Caller hearing echo when using cassette adapter on phone in car. Advice? When I'm on a call in my car and my phone is plugged into my cassette player adapter in the car (yes...I have a cassette player in my car), the caller always hears an echo back. Everything sounds fine on my end. The cassette adapter is pretty new, and worked fine with my previous phone (Galaxy S4). I have tried googling issue and haven't come across anything that helps. Any advice? Anyone else have this problem? Do I need a different adapter? If it helps, I purchased the cassette adapter on Amazon: BESDATA Universal Car Cassette Player Adapter with 3.5mm Male Jack and 2.5mm Plug Adapter for iPod, iPad, iPhone, MP3, Mobil Device, Black.Thanks in advance for your help!

Are there any slim, high quality Note 5 cases similar to Apple's official cases for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus? [Talking about something like this.](http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MKXW2ZM/A/iphone-6s-leather-case-black?fnode=2e1d0c6a809301905a8c0ebb37c72cfbc9386633234d2c178e1564f7cf3207445d5e203444abc5a4cb2bb4c34d642cb66172b1fce62bfb75b2299f63ac458243739ed0fa1531cd8a82d37ca5e5a06e601c3710aa308c8a79f7b8d60c7bd16efe57a32390b6ff346f60b33a385453ab50)  I haven't been a case guy for my past few phones, but with this one being so slippery and expensive, I wouldn't mind adding a case as attractive and minimal as those Apple cases.  I tried searching amazon, but there's mostly thick/cheap/ugly cases on there.
Note 5 Deals? So I've been on my unlimited Data plan for a while and I think I'm gonna have to suck it up and leave it behind, I definitely need a new phone. I was going back and forth between Note 5, S6 and Nexus 6P and I think Ill go with the Note 5 for size and GearVR.(I really wish it had Type-c usb though)That being said, any good deals on it atm? I thought I remembered seeing a commercial. Or maybe something going on at Costco?
(Opinion) S Pen more responsive than Apple Pencil Just played with the iPad Pro and Apple Pencil at the Apple Store in my local mall, two things I was really (and still am, but to a lesser degree) excited about. I started drawing using Adobe Sketch and then an app called Zen something, I can't remember. I got some praise from a handful of employees there for my sketch but I really think the S Pen is more responsive than the Apple Pencil. I was shocked! There were some strokes I made that took longer to appear than they should have and it was noticeable and messed me up. So I just wanted to say we've got a good stylus on our hands.

[Question] Will the Note 5 N920I Model support UK Bands for GSM/3G/4G? I'm thinking of importing a Note 5, Model N920I via eBay from Hong Kong, and whilst I've checked that its compatible with the 4G bands used by all UK Networks, is it likely to be GSM and 3G compatible? Can anyone else foresee any other issues I'd have using this handset? Also, what's your faviroute colour? That blue looks pretty sweet, but I'm not sure. Thanks!
So, got an email from Best Buy today saying my 64gb Note 5 is backordered. Has this happened to anyone else? It's not available to pick up at the store near me but one that is an hour and a half away.  So I picked to ship it to me,  which made it take an extra week and now it's saying it's backordered.  Wonder when I can expect it.  And first time pre-ordering a phone from Best Buy.  My luck. 
Wireless Charging not work and codes for diagnostic menu not working. So I just got a Galaxy Note 5 through Verizon and love it.  I am having a couple issues however.**Wireless Charging not working:**The wireless charging isn't working very well.  I should note that I bought a third party wireless charger and I have a case for the phone.

Any help or comments would be appreciated.**Secret Diagnostic Menu Code Not working:**I found a video online that talks about some units not working with third party wireless chargers.  In the video the guy also gives a code to access a hidden diagnostic menu.  This code along with many others is not working on my phone.  Is this an issue with verizon maybe?

Thanks in advance for the help.
S Pen screen glitch There's a section of my Note 5's screen where the pointer stops following the pen and it gets un-calibrated and really sensitive. It makes it incredibly difficult to do anything in that section of the screen. I haven't been able to find anything about this online, and the Samsung tech support person I talked to didn't seem to know either. I also haven't had time to bring it into the carrier store.Edit: http://imgur.com/kYjaiwHere's a link to a screenshot of a note I made with the glitch.
Anybody download new update yet? Thoughts? I'm with Wind (Canadian carrier) just got a notification for an update for improvements on performance and stability as well as wireless charging.

Exactly how fast is the Samsung Fast Wireless Charger? 
Multiple Charger Connects So I'm curious about something. I've had my note 5 for about 2 weeks and absolutely love the phone. About a week ago, I noticed that my phone was fast charging only intermittently. I isolated the issue to the USB cable that came with the phone. I bought a replacement, and haven't had an issue since. But using an app that tells you how many times you have connected your phone to the charger, I noticed just over 20connects. Yes, my phone is original and not a refurbished one. I guess I must of connected it to the charger way too many times while trying to diagnose the issue over a week. Of time. If it was only done for a duration of a couple of seconds at a time, could this have caused any harm to the battery? I'm just curious. Any feedback would be appreciated.

Cell Standby bug still unresolved? (Verizon) Got the phone a month ago. Was fine for a week. Then cell standby started decimating my battery when I was connected to wifi (like many others). So I just turned off wifi for a few weeks and I never saw Cell Standby ever again in my battery usage and my battery life was perfect. I've had a couple updates pushed since giving up on wifi and got curious so I enabled wifi again, and of course within an hour Cell Standby is already up to 5%...WTF?There are tons of threads on this all over the internet but no recent updates to any of them and no clear fix to this problem. How is this not a bigger issue? Or am I just unlucky?Anyone know anything recent about this stupid issue? Good thing I have UDP and verizons LTE is almost as fast as wifi anyways. Although the concept of having wifi rape the shit out of your battery on a 70super phone is borderline absurd....

Thinking of picking up the ZeroLemon case When I had my note 3 I used the zerolemon case and that battery it came with would easily last me 5 days on a full charged batter. I think that was around 10000mah and this one is 3500mah. Right now Im using a spigen hybrid case and Im liking that the case still shows off the phone, and it doesn't add much bulk at all. Does anybody have this new zerolemon case, and do you think it would be worth upgrading from what I have?
Download booster? On AT&ampT. With my Note 4, I could do the Nova shortcut trick to enable download booster. Doing the same on the Note 5 allows the shortcut to be created ,but clicking on it opens the download booster screen and it instantly closes.

Wireless fast charging suddenly not working I've been using the Samsung wireless fast charger for about a month now with no issues. Suddenly this morning the charging pauses after about 10secs and won't restart. Replacing the phone on the charger doesn't work, it just starts and stops again. Restarting doesn't work. I tried the daydream fix and that doesn't have any effect either! What could be causing this?

Case + Wireless Charging? Hi,I just got a Note 5 (my first Note) and so far I like it. I haven't bought the wireless charger, but I was thinking it might be a little more convenient on the nightstand or desk at work. I also haven't bought a case yet. I don't want a case that's too bulky, but one that does offer some more protection. Are there any that actually work well with wireless charging? Do you think wireless charging is even worth doing, or better to spend the money on a couple quick charge cables? I've seen mixed reviews about wireless charging with cases, and I don't want to drop $7on the charging pad to find out it doesn't really work. What are your experiences?Thanks!

Is there a way to make my phone not be visible over bluetooth? I work in an environment where people are testing Bluetooth products. This phone makes its Bluetooth visible regardless if you are in the settings screen or not and people keep accidentally trying to pair with my phone. Under Quick connect settings I set device visibility to only when quick connect is turned on but that does not help.I would just turn BT off while at work but I have a Moto 36I use all the time and dont want to lose that functionality.Any ideas short of disabling quick connect or shutting off BT?
Forced default apps When opening something from one app into another it asks what app I want to use like normal but there's no just once option. It forces me to choose a default app.Sometimes I want to open the same kind of links in different apps for different reasons and don't want to set a default. Is there a way to do this on the Note 5?Also, is this behavior a functionality of the launcher (touchwiz)? I've never used a different launcher before so I don't know if that's part of what a launcher does or not.
Is there a way to send written notes as a picture? Besides screenshots, can I use the stylus to write a note to someone and then send that note to someone with ease? I'm using Textra so I'm assuming I can only take a screenshot of the note and send it that way. 
I can live without the SD card slot, but not without an extended battery. Do you think the Note 5 battery can be replaced with a bigger capacity one? I mean replacing the battery altogether, and not an add-on battery case that plugs into the micro USB port. Just wonder if you guys think it's possible? 
Can I use the Note 3 charger to fast charge the Note 5? Hi all,I am considering importing the Note 5 from overseas as it's not available in Europe.Does anyone know if the Note 3 charger is the same as the Note 5 charger? Will it also fast charge it if I use the Note 5 USB cable?Is there anything special about the Note 5 charger?
Is anyone else experiencing this? When I pull out the s pen while the phone is off the screen won't respond to anything on the top row (where the notification bar would be). I think it has something to do with the fact that my phone isn't unlocked yet. So basically if I use an app before unlocking my phone, the top of the screen is unresponsive. 
Why do certain apps show in notifications even when the app is closed? I use the app DroidCamX sometimes. Right now I'm not using it and it's showing up under my notifications and all it says it DroidCamX. It's not an app that is currently open and the notification is just annoying the hell out of me. 
Is internal storage going to be a problem for Gear VR So the device has 32/64GB of internal storage once you connect it to your Gear Vr there is no input left available to connect a flash drive. So to have the best experience you have to download content to your phone. From what I have read videos have to play content at 20mbps to deal with pixelation and black levels which means they are fairly decent in size 3D movies being like 20gig in size. I don't begin to even comprehend all of what I am reading but would love to get someone to explain it to me like i am five. Update: No SD slot on Gear Vr Consumer Edition http://imgur.com/A8QClHp

Should I jailbreak this phone?  I have never jail broken a phone before, and if so is there an easy 1 -3 step jailbreak method?
Bluetooth stutter in car? I use Bluetooth in my car all of the time for music.  I've noticed that it stutters every once in a while. My Turbo, Z3v or Note 2-4 never did this. I've turned off the contact auto sync and tried different music players, power amp, stock Samsung one, Pandora, Spotify. Google play and they all seem to do that. Music will play for 5-15  minutes then the connection will lag/stutter for a good 2seconds. Has anybody else experienced this?  Or found a workaround it? Thanks!

Buying a Note 5 on Sunday. Those of you with 32g, how are you holding up? I can't decide if the additional 32g is worth $100.

Still, 16g requires me to delete photos and downloads too often for me now.
Considering getting a note 5, have a few questions. Hey dudes, I'm considering a note 5 for my next phone. It will only be my second android phone with my first being a nexus 5 that I bought direct from google. If I get the note 5 it will be on a plan through optus (Australian telco). My wife has an S6 on optus and it has certain things like a boot animation from the carrier that I'm wondering if I can remove if I get the note 5? I guess what I'm really asking is can I get the phone to look/act/feel like it's an outright, off carrier phone? What's involved in unlocking the boatloader? What kind of custom rom development should I expect? As a nexus user I'm spoilt for choice as far as custom development, I'm expecting there will be less for the note? Also, how easy is it to go back to stock if I root? I've flashed factory images for my nexus 5 many times and it's a pretty simple process. Is it similar for a note or much more complicated?Thanks in advance for any help/information :)

Best third party fast wireless charger? Hi - looking to pick up a fast wireless charger this weekend. Any thoughts on which is the most recommended? (I'm in Canada)
Fast Wireless Charging I just recently purchased a Note 5 and I'm thinking about picking up a wireless charger. Does anyone know if there are any chargers besides Samsung's official wireless charger which will utilize the fast wireless charging on the Note 5? I've looked around for this information online and haven't been able to find it. 
New Note 5 owner needs help setting up. Just switched over from an iPhone 6. I loved the iPhone but I just wanted to mix things up with my t-mobile jump upgrade. I need help setting up a few things. So my primary concern is battery life. I know android is a lot more finicky and unstable when it comes to battery life. Can someone tell me what sort of settings I can apply to be sure there isn't some background service or unnecessary process or app that chugs battery life? I'm not looking to cripple my user experience. I just want this phone to have at least as good battery life as my iPhone 6 did which was able to get me through my 9 to 5 job with 50% minimum left by the time I got home. Another thing is that for some reason the phone doesn't recognize my chrome casts. I'm on the same WiFi and I can't get it to find them. Also, all my friends are on imessage. I was sure to disable imessage and FaceTime before trading in my phone. I also went to the Apple deregister site which said I was already unregistered. My girlfriend said she was sending me texts and I still was not receiving them. I want to be sure I have it set up so that I get all texts. I also want to make sure my group sms is fine and not responding to group texts by creating separate individual threads with each of the participants on their respective phones. Any other tips and tricks would greatly be appreciated. Thanks.
Thinking of purchasing a Note 5! Some questions. How do you find your battery life generally? I'm coming from a Nexus 5 with horrible battery problems.Coming from a stock Google experience, what can I expect? And could rooting get me that stock experience if I really wanted it? Etc Etc. Thanks guys :)
Screen rotating during games My wife just got a new note 5, and likes to play those hidden object games on it. They're is a problem she is having where the screen will constantly rotate from rightside-up to upsidedown over and over while in landscape mode, regardless of whether it's is rotation locked or not. The game she plays auto changes to landscape when she starts it.Does anyone else have this sort of issue?
Can someone please grace me with a Sm-920T (Tmobile ) STOCK rom? I need it to be completely stock, I bricked my note 5 by formatting with a custom kernel, rebooting, and forgetting to turn on OEM Unlock... fuck me right? So, I need a completely stock rom, there are ones on sammobile but I can't pay for a membership until I get my replacement card.  Thanks for reading and thanks for your help.
Ideal Resolution/Pic Size For Background No matter how I resize or reshape my pics I cannot get a good background for the note 5 and the cropping tool only gets me so far. Anyone know the ideal res or pic size for backgrounds?
blarghhhh - got my samsung pay beta email but still can't get the app to be anything but that preview page - help?? I've tried clearing data and cache for the Samsung Pay Stub app, rebooted phone, etc. Every time I open the app it's just the informational page with nothing to click on to setup or install the full app. Can't find the full app in galaxy apps store, nothing.beta email said to check for system software updates, I did and there were none, but now I have to wait 24 hours to check again (can I reset that counter to try again??)edit: I did a live chat with samsung and they couldn't help at all the rep said she escalated my issue to the next level team and that they would contact me in 1-2 business days.
Is there any way to toggle off the feature where it ignores touch inputs when using the S-Pen? I want to play games, two handed, one wielding the S-Pen. ^ titleThe game I am trying to play, if it matters, is Vainglory, it's a phone MOBA, pretty popular as I found out about it on twitch, could never get used to touch controls on other phones but it feels very PC-like with the S-Pen the only problem is that you have to pull back the pen far enough to remove the cursor to press an on screen button (like a spell or attack) with your other finger.Game would be epic if this feature could be turned off. Anyone, my note is rooted if that matters? I tried googling this, but I only got lists of games that were coded for the s-pen, nothing related to this.
Recovery Second time trying a post like this so here goes.I accidentally deleted my whole camera album because the thumbnail was a selfie I accidentally took and so deleted it not realising what I had clicked on.Ive tried a couple of apps but have been told I need root for best chance of recovery. I don't want to root because I am happy with stock and package disabler pro and don't want to lose Samsung PAY.Can anyone help me, such as a good desktop recovery client that can search my android disk?Also whats the easiest and most effective way to back up a Note 5?
Random reboot during phone call Is there a particular way to fix this issue? I heard arter97 kernel is the way to go to fix that but it's definitely not working for me (it never boots up past the initial Galaxy Note 5 splash screen)I'm currently using the spacex test kernel. 
Att Note 5 update? since i saw tmobile was possibly rolling out an update today i checked my phone for an update. it found one. its only 118.8 mb but currently its downloading. will report back after its installed. 
Question about formula mode I just got the note 5 a few hours ago, i used to have the note 3. A feature i used all the time was being able to solve equations using the formula mode. i have downloaded the extension pack in s note and got the selection tool and now have the option to make my drawn equations into text form but i cant figure out how to search the equation to get the answer like i have previously done on the note 3.. PLEASE PLEASE help, if i find out this feature is gone i honestly might just go back to my old note thats how much i used it.
Does fast charging only work with the wall plug that the Note 5 comes with? Seems like charging is pretty slow in my car...

Package Disabler Question So I downloaded package disabler pro....but the app says it doesn't have the appropriate permissions....help!
Why do carriers have ultimate control over android OS? I don't understand why everything has to be approved by the carriers before being released to us. I'm on at&ampt and it's bad enough that I have to have their damn logo on the back of my phone, but my phone gets loaded with their bloatware and they just delay the release of software updates on top of the delay from Samsung. Also, why the hell do they get to choose to lock the bootloader?At least I get to use samsung pay, a hardware feature of the phone which is also a pretty big selling point, Verizon users don't even have this option.  This is no different than the carriers deciding we can't use the s-pen, they are both hardware functions that are part of the phone. Why can apple sell unbranded phones with zero bloatware?  Why can we buy other android devices from at&ampt with an unlocked bootloader?Also if anyone has the international version, can you use samsung pay just fine?
Now that the Note 5 has been out a couple of weeks, what's everyone's opinions on it? As someone who finds himself constantly researching forums and videos about the Note 5, I was curious what everyone's thoughts were on the device? Any lag, how's battery life, general performance?
How can I send or receive good quality videos on a text message? Just found out how crappy android-texted videos are, and how good iphone-texted videos are....  any recommendations?
Does the Note 5 use Apical's Assertive Display Tech? There was news last year in june/july that future exynos based samsung handsets  would have this tech. I'm torn right now between the note and the upcoming lumia 950xl.  The Assertive Display tech looks like it helps with one of my most serious gripes with oled displays (sunlight readability).
Keyboard that auto corrects words with any punctuation? For example when I type where is the rainbpw? is there a keyboard that will replace rainbpw? with rainbow? without first having to hit the space bar then delete the space then add the question mark? It's kind of driving me nuts coming from iOS.

Back button stops working every now and then Does anyone else have this issue? It's not that serious, but I notice that every so often, when I'm in an app the back button is unresponsive. I have to close the app (multitask --&gt swipe/exit out) and open it again to get it working in that app again.
Screen scratch Has anyone had any trouble with the screen scratching easy? Just purchased phone and noticed a scratch on it today. It looks as if the s pen may have scratched the screen itself? Any input would be great

A few questions regarding my note 5 I dont know if anyone has touched base on these already but i wanted clear answers on all.1) i dont have predictive text - nor can i find it anywhere in settings.2) music quality is shiii. I use spotify and use the same earphones and spotify settings i did on my iphone 6 plus. When volume is full blast u still keep trying to put it up because its so low.3) heads up wtf were they thinking!  I have two third party apps that apparently get rid of them but they don't work like they're meant to - i have ticker and heads off. This is one thing i researched a lot on and apparently u cant disable it on lollipop 5.1.1....??? I wouldnt mind it if it was as clean as iphone's one but sometimes the heads up notification is so large (full message AND fb profile pic or whatever other icon)4) i always get a notification saying my device is running slow. I am running Themer, which crashes often - is it not compatible yet? Or is something wrong with my device all up?So far i think thats all my issues... .Thanks for your help! I dont wanna regret this phone...

Moving to Note 5 from iOS I'm wanting to find out your opinion on what to do to get ready for an Android device and make the transition from my iPhone easier. Are there any apps that will aid that process? Like photos, contacts etc...
You can change the spen sounds with this app! Note Buddy is an app in the play store which allows you to change the detachment and insertion sounds of the spen. I downloaded sounds from the notification section of the app Zedge and implemented them in the Note Buddy app. Now everytime I take my Spen out it sneezes. :D
Can't get rid of swype I installed swype keyboard to try it out for a while but ended up going back to the default samsung keyboard. I uninstalled the app, however, in my language and input settings swype is still listed as an option, and even works if i set it as the default keyboard. What is going on here? How can I get rid of this?

Who has a glass screen protector for your phone? Been reading some reviews for tempered glass screen protectors on amazon. Lots of people are describing a halo effect on their screens do to the slight curve of the front screen.

Cheers!
Galaxy Note 5 S-Pen leaked 
Samsung Pay broken? Last week, out of the blue, Samsung Pay stopped working on my Note 5. I was at CVS, about to use it, when I noticed there was an update for samsung pay. Since I didnt have time to update it, I put it off and tried to use samsung pay but it started giving me some weird error every time I tried to use my fingerprint to authenticate. And needless to say, it didnt work. So later on I reset the app, and after that it just went nuts. Every time since then I try to register a card it says Failed to register card, please try again later. Reset the app a bunch of times, deleted and reinstalled framework, but no luck. App is fully up to date now btw. I talked to samsung pay support who walked me through stuff I'd already tried (clear cache, reset app, factory reset phone) with no luck. Any suggestions? 
Switched from Apple to Samsung, notification questions Is there a way to get notifications to illuminate the display? messages and whats app for example do it but facebook messenger. twitter and a few others don't (they vibrate and push the notifications to the lock screen but don't actually light the display up). Is this something that has been replaced with the pulse light or am I missing something? I have had a look through settings multiple times already.I recently moved from an iphone (last android I had was the galaxy s2) so I am just getting used to it. Any help would be appreciated.
Delayed Notifications I've noticed since I bought the note 5 that when I'm on WiFi and have the fingerprint lockscreen that sometimes I won't get a notification until I unlock the phone, anyone having this issue or know how to fix it?
Texting lag.... Anyone expiriencing lag after sending a text?Example: I typing in Hello and hit send. I follow up to type How is your day going and the keyboard will not react till about 2 to 3 seconds have passed.This is really driving me nuts, especially on a brand new Note 5 (T-Mobile).....

I try to compare the best Android smartphones...and the winner is [Comparison](http://imgur.com/a/F6CKZ)  Personally the Note 5 is the best by a decent margin.  The Nexus 6P is pretty strong and a couple hundred less.  The Droid Turbo 2 is actually a strong 3rd as I find the 5.4 display a nice compromise from true phablet size.  I know this is not an in-depth comparison, but considering speed, display, brightness, s-pen, battery and despite the high cost the Note is still the KING!

Hi there, I'm a S6Edge+ user who wants to know your battery secrets. I can't find an active subreddit for people with my phone, but since we're basically the same, I was wondering if anybody was willing to share their battery life secrets with me. You guys are getting like 6-7 hours of on screen time, meanwhile I'm sitting here wondering what's going on at 3.5-4.I have an Android Wear device so my Bluetooth is on 24/7 and I have mobile data and WiFi both on and smart network enabled. I found a post here earlier that was talking about some optimization secrets involving disabling location history and turning off location, enabling auto restart, etc etc. But even after doing those things I still don't seem to be getting near your huge battery life. My main power drain seems to be Hangouts according to the battery screen. Is there anything that particularly smashes battery life? Should I disable smart network switch? Thanks.
Any other T-Mobile customers going nuts wondering what (if anything) is planned for pre-order? What does pre-registration even mean? It's not like it will really help allocate units to areas of the country as they don't collect address information. Despite it's drawbacks I'm actually really wanting this device and it's starting to drive me nuts that some AT&ampT customers have actually already started receiving them and T-Mobile customers don't really know how they can buy this device outside of the fact that it will be available in stores this Friday.Then Legere drops [this little tease](https://twitter.com/JohnLegere/status/632231284287385600) on twitter yesterday.Ahhh!

5 Reasons To Buy The Samsung Galaxy Note 5 **This is a serious thread only. Read this, if you are willing to buy Note5**. I am not here to promote Note 5 product but listing some features that might get you interested into Samsung latest Note series.------**S-Pen:**sliding the S Pen out will automatically bring up a notes app so you can start scribbling straight away, which isn??t too dissimilar from Microsoft Surface Pro stylus and One Note combo. Pressure sensitivity and writing accuracy has also been improved. You can also write on screen while the screen is turned off.------**Specs:**Samsung??s new Note has been upgraded to the same 64-bit architecture found in the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge ??the Exynos 7420. Add to that 4GB of RAM and a less bloated TouchWiz, and you??ve got a speedy device. Samsung outclasses the rest of the Android competition in speed with its latest flagships.------**Design:**Just like the S6, it looks like the premium device that its high price-tag commands. The 5.7-inch display is slightly smaller than last year??s version, but the Note 5 still sits comfortably in the phablet zone. Moreover, It also has Samsung??s trademark Super AMOLED quad-HD (2k) display, which is still one of the best screens on the market.------**Top-end camera:**One of the two most important features in a smartphone to consumers (the other being batterylife). Samsung??s recent camera efforts have been nothing short of stellar. The Note 4 took the 2014 top spot, as did the S6 and S6 Edge. The Note 5 has the same 16MP camera in the aforementioned flagship handsets, which means the same speed, quality and detail that the S6 and S6 Edge produce. With the Note 5??s camera, you can take pictures quickly with its fast autofocus and shutter speed (less than a second), record 4K footage and filter your face beyond recognition with Samsung??s many editing options. There??s also the Note??s impressive low-light performance, which again outperforms its rivals.------**Samsung Pay:**Are you a lazy fool who hates carrying around a wallet full of MasterCard? Well, now you can virtually pay with your virtual MasterCard using Galaxy Note 5.If you are here for a new phone, great and premium looking design with compelling specs, Note 5 will not disappoint at the current market level.

Have the carriers removed Internet Calling from the Note 5 like they did with the S6? I'm specifically asking about the stock Android SIP client that's part of the phone dialer app, which allows for VOIP configuration. I have it on my Note 3, but it's missing from the S6. Did Samsung also take it out of the ROM for the Note 5?

Update to Samsung pay not working I tried to use SP, it said there was an update, so I updated. It says I have fingerprint as my verification, but it will now require a PIN, too.

Over and over without allowing me to enter a PIN. Any ideas?

Can i root the Note 5 without changing kernel? What's up with changing kernels when rooting lately? I never changed a kernel to root a phone and that's what i had to do on the Nexus 5 but when i change the kernel i start thinking shit, now the battery life will go to crap because that XDA developer optimized it and messed around with the code ... How did you root your Note? If changing the kernel is the only option for rooting what kernel should i use to be close to stock kernel?Thanks

Problems fast charging with stock charger I've had my Note 5 since launch. have not had an issue charging at all until today. the stock charger and usb will not 'fast charge' my phone. at first i thought this was a fault with the phone. i purchased this [Aukey portable fast charger](http://www.amazon.com/Qualcomm-Certified-Aukey-10400mAh-Supported/dp/B00UBDI7EC) and when i charge the phone from this portable charger, the phone has no problem fast charging.

Galaxy Note 5 Video Test FHD 1080p (60fps) 
iPhone to Note 5 (or android in general) Hello everyone, I'm very interested to hear everyone's thoughts on this but more so if you have previously been an avid iPhone user and have now made the switch to android. I myself have had every iPhone out and have tried to make the switch many times however this has failed and resulted in me going back to apple. I have had the sony xperia, note 1, note 2, galaxy s2, galaxy s3, oneplus one and now most recently the Note 5. I love the note 5 its blazing fast and I love the customisability of it. However that being said I find myself questioning just a couple of things. Let me know your own thoughts, good and bad.1. Camera - now the camera is awesome (in perfect light situations) I find myself using the flash a hell of a lot more. The front camera seems to over smooth the look of the picture. A kind of air brush look if you will. 2. Battery - I seem to be spending a lot of time analyizing my battery since reading these forums haha. So far its pretty decent with my wireless chargers coming next week I suppose this will make it easier to charge. Just a side note, I'm in the UK on o2 UK and currently using an imported Note 5 W8 variation (Canadian).
Best Micro-USB for Note5? I was wondering what is the best Micro-USB cable for the Note 5? I've been looking around to find a good one (preferably braided cables) that will charge my Note 5 since the original cable keeps getting too hot and for some reason wont fast charge the phone. Also another question, if I get a new cable will fast charging be affected?
Package Disabler questions I recently bought Package Disabler and removed all bloatware and some other things I have no use for like S Voice as I used  Google Now. So, all in all about 13things removed. Will this show a decent improvement in battery life? Thank you in advance.
Can you help me decide...? Good morning. I'm between three phones... Its the nexus 6, the note 4, and the note 5. I'm leaning more towards one of the two notes. I had a note 2 a while back and loved it then switched to the G2 and got used to no battery removal or SD card so that's not a factor. Can you guys give me some reasons as to why either or has any significance over the other? Gonna cross post this in both note sub's. Thanks!
Battery stats: which of three things should I be turning off? My battery life on my new note 5 is acceptable but not great.http://imgur.com/a/GsD6aI notice several services running in the background that may be contributing to the battery drain. Which of these are unnecessary? Do you know what any of them do? I'm using package disabler but I'm being really careful what I turn off.Edit: sent from my phone, so naturally the title is misspelled...
Help with changing dpi and getting into usb debug I am trying to change my dpi and am using this guide:http://android.wonderhowto.com/how-to/change-your-androids-screen-resolution-without-root-access-0160439/However, when I try to see my density using 'grep' it says the command doesn ot work. If I try to change my dpi it will also say my device is not found. I have already enabled usb debugging in developer options, although I have no idea what actually should happen to signal it is in debug mode. Right now all I see is charging and connected as a media device and I can browse the media files on my computer with it. Changing it to camera doesn't do anything either. There is no indication of debug mode so I suspect it is not connecting properly or some windows driver issue. I have tried multiple usb ports and no difference.
How to Record 4k videos on Samsung Note 5 More than 5 Minutes 
Glass Screen Protectors: Has anybody had any luck finding one that works for your Note 5? I just got my Note 5 yesterday and I do not want to use it until I get a case and screen protector.  I have looked at reviews for just about every glass protector on Amazon and they all seem to have major issues (halo, being too small, not fitting correctly, breaking after a few days, etc).  Does anyone have a solid recommendation for a glass screen protector?  Alternatively, if all the glass ones suck, will a plastic protector work with the s-pen and, if so, which one(s) do you recommend?
No external damage, touch screen broken, advice? I expect I know the answer here but I figured I'd see if anyone had any pointers. I just dropped my note 5 (~3 feet, hard wood floor, flat face down, Verus Pro case). There seems to be no external damage, but the phone is getting increasingly shittier. Symptoms:- S Pen fully functional- Normal touch (fingers) non functional- More and more screen pixels dying (moving from top left diagonally towards bottom right)I am just days outside of the 15 day manufacturer warranty, and didn't buy any extended warranty through Verizon. Do I have any options outside of expensive screen/sensor repairs?Side note, very bummed about the whole affair. Never broken a phone out of the many I owned, and a small drop fucks the internals of this cased phone? Weak.
Looking to switch system font to Roboto Light...is iFont the only way/best way? Do you know of a better way to switch the system font to Roboto Light?
Anyone having issues sending photos with text? Every time I try to attach a photo to a text message, it just sends the photo instead of attaching it to the text so I can still type with it.  The only way I can add text to the photo before sending is if the recipient field is blank.  Likewise, if I'm looking at a photo in my gallery and choose to share via messages, it asks for the recipient(s), then sends it without allowing me to add text.  Has anyone else run into this problem?  And if so, is there a setting somewhere to allow me to attach the photo to the text/multimedia message and not just send the photo?
Slow performance As per title, my Note 5 has shown me a few disappointing results such as choppy animation when I open up my app drawer using Nova launcher (Nova Prime) as well as slow frame rates in some games (which are not very heavy in the graphics). One of which I compared with my friend's iPhone 6 and hers outshined and outclassed my Note 5 in the games department. Is it possible I could have received a faulty note 5 or has anyone else experienced something similar?
What's causing my Note 5 to sometimes take a long time to wake up? Occasionally the Note 5 will take forever to wake up. I suspect Smart App Manager is the culprit. Any ideas?

Tempered glass screen protector. I know this has been asked a lot here, but it's been a few months since the most recent one, so I was hoping if there was an updated list of proven quality tempered glass protectors. I've bought two off Amazon already and both have some pretty bad halo effect. I've seen Zagg thrown around a bit, but I really don't want to throw down $4if it's not going to fit properly.Thanks for the help guys! 
photo editing feature missing from the note 5 that is on the 3? Sorry but I've spent the last hour looking at the galaxy app store and the Google play store for something similar but I can't find anything good.on the note 3 you can edit a photo from the gallery and add a frame on digital images I'm not sure if this feature on the 4 because I never had it but I had it on the 3 and I used it a lot. now I know you can download filters from the gallery app store from within the app but the frame option is not there. can anyone point me in the right direction and help  a guy out?thanks for your time.
How to take scrolling screenshot on Galaxy Note 5 
Samsung Note 5 Colours in Canada I was speaking to a Samsung rep in Canada and they mentioned that they would only be releasing the Black Sapphire. Is that true? I've been waiting to buy the note in another colour but might purchase today if its only black that will be released.
Any Issues with Screen Protectors and S Pen? Hi all.  I want to buy a Note 5 - pretty psyched - but I can't imagine spending over $80on a device and not putting a tempered glass screen protector on it.What are your experiences using the S Pen with a screen protector on?Thanks for the input!  :D

Hands On With The Galaxy Note 5 And S6 Edge+. 
Anyone else got a ~130MB update? My Indian unit got an update that had security and performance improvements as the description, along with increased call stability. Anyone else got this, and if so, do you notice any improvements?
Just bought my first Note I've had mostly Samsung phones so I know the lay of the land but never used an S pen or a Note. Any links or guides or whatever to help me get the best and most out of my new phone?
A possible solution to the no sd card slot issue. It's called Dash Micro - Mini MicroSD Card Reader for Android. You can keep it on your key ring. Only 12 bucks on amazon
Selling/Trading a mint condition Verizon Note 5 (32GB/White). Looking for the T-Mobile version. Phone is unlocked with a clean IMEI 
Phone vibrates when I pick it up? Does anyone else feel their Note 5 vibrate when they pick it up quickly? No notifications are going off, but it vibrates quickly. It's not phantom, because I definitely feel it in my hands. I never noticed it until a week ago or so. 
Does the Note5 have stereo speakers or mono? Looked for this everywhere but still can't find an answer. 
S - Health question I know this probably isn't directly Note 5 related but I've noticed in S Health that I've never been able to input a profile (age/height/weight/etc).  I did disable a few stock apps (if someone can direct me to a list with the safe to disable ones that'd be great) so that could be the problem but I thought I'd ask for help.Anyone know?
[Meta] Status of this subreddit With the Galaxy Note 5 coming in the very near future, what's the status on getting this sub ready? Can we get something like /r/Naut? :)That scrolling banner up top is using a ton of CPU on my laptop.
What video editor are you using? One of the primary reasons I got this phone was for the camera. I'm getting into making movies/videos for fun and didn't want to drop the necessary money on a good camera plus proper video editing equipment. The built in video editor is ok, but it's not as full featured as I'd like. I'm ok buying an app, but I don't want to until I hear some good testimonial from a Note 5 user. So thoughts?
Trouble after att update [deleted]
Sometimes the back button doesn't work. Anyone else? It just happens randomly. Weird.
Fast charging lock screen is obnoxious, any way to disable it? Does anyone have something similar? Whenever I'm fast charging and wish to unlock my phone, it asks me to swipe, then I must do my fingerprint. I wouldn't mind the 2 unnecessary steps, however there's a big fat ad where my thumb would swipe (at the bottom of the screen.) This ad seems third party because I doubt Samsung would throw ads in, but if it's not, is there a setting I can look into that takes that swipe to unlock screen away?
Is Samsung going to forget about the Note 5 just like they did with the Note 4? What an awful company Samsung is by basically leaving the Note 4 in the dark without the Android 5.1 update nor updating it's TouchWiz skin to reflect the Galaxy S6's skin. Do not buy the Note 5 if you are going to reret later on when the Galaxy S7 and you realize you won't expierence any of the new software features of the S7 in a future update, because the Note 5 will have the S6 skin and you'll be stuck with it. I'm telling you from experience. Because Samsung only favors S owner and not Note owners
Back glass breaking/cracking/scratching easily? I have my phone in a case 90% of the time. It is in an Otterbox Symmetry. I took it out at work yesterday and didn't drop it at all.I work at BBY Mobile and sometimes I demonstrate how tough the Zagg Glass Screen Protector and Otterbox Symmetry is by dropping my phone on the carpet from hip height (on a 5ft 3in girl) so about 3ft from the ground.Anyway, this crack wasn't there last time I took it out of the case when I was at home on Monday but now today I have a small crack starting from the U in Samsung and curving down. It isn't a bad one but it still bothers me since I do my best to keep my phones in tip top shape due to JOD not having insurance. (I'm with T-Mobile)Anyway, does anyone else notice that the back glass tends to break easily? It's making me want to give this phone to my mom and switch to the Nexus 6.
Got my Note 5 in the mail yesterday First time I dropped it the back screen cracked. I just wanted to give everyone else a heads up. Get a case!!!
Can I return the note 5 because the LCD is bleeding 
Help please!! I've has my note 5 for about 6 days now and a couple days ago while at work it randomly starts making the charging noise then say,  in the notification bar, the dock is connected. It is continuing to do this and is also a random time when not plugged in saying not charging with an x over an empty battery. I have tried wiping the cache partition and that didn't help and it is still doing this I've let it die I've restarted it I've done everything I can think of and it still won't work. Any help is appreciated!
Note 5 Titanium Silver US Release Info I found a reddit (I can't find it anymore) post saying that they talked to a samsung rep. and found out the silver color will come to the US. So today I tried my luck and live chatted with a samsung rep. and I twisted his words into getting him to tell me if the US was getting the silver color. I then stated So to clairify, you are confirming that the titanium silver color will come to the US? He then replied, Yes it will have a release in the US but the information on a release date is not available yet. If anyone has anymore info on this subject, please post a comment. My contract is up mid-October and I hope they have the silver note 5 in the US by then.
Need help with optimizing battery life I'm not going to complain about battery life because that won't get me anywhere. There is one thing I need help with though, cell standby is taking up a ton of my battery. I read a de-bloating article and it talked about how to fix the issue. It said just go into your dialer setting and turn off voice over LTE or something along those lines. That person was on T-mobile, I am on Verizon and I don't have the same option. Does anyone know how I would go about optimizing cell standby on Verizon? 
Note 5 or S6? I'm upgrading from this phone that I should've upgraded from a long time ago... But I waited to pick between the two giants of Samsung. My current phone is only 4.1 and a bigger screen would do good for me. A little background, I use my phone mainly for watching YouTube videos, using maps (I drive everyday), checking social media, and read blogs, books, and comics. But my only worry is putting it in my pocket and the huge adjustment if I get the Note 5, is the huge change worth it? P.S. I plan to keep this phone for at most 5 years (If it doesn't break). Spec-wise, both Note 5 and S6 are beastly already.
Replacing battery and rooting [deleted]
If you have cards that are not supported on Samsung Pay and want them supported, now is the time to call, message and tweet your bank/issuer and tell them you want to use your card on Samsung Pay.[xpost /r/samsung] Starting to today I'm sending requests for Samsung Pay support to all of my cards that are not currently supported. That includes Discover (they are planning for support in 2016), Chase, Barclaycard, Comenity, Navy Federal and PenFed. I'm calling, sending a message from my account, and I'm going to publicly tweet them as well. I urge other Samsung pay users to do the same with their banks/issuers who are not currently supporting Samsung Pay.
I've done a factory reset and now I can't log back in. So, I've done a factory reset after Verizon's recent update (it seems to have messed up some stuff) and now when I turn the phone on, it asks me to log into my Google account. I've done that except it's asking for the owner's account. That is the owner's account. I've changed my password to better able type it in. Would that have caused something?Edit: I've called Verizon and they forwarded me to Google, saying it's Google security feature and Verizon can't do anything about it. Google told me that the security feature makes it so that if I've modified my Google account in any way (password change) in the last 72 hours, I need to wait 72 hours. Even if I didn't modify my account, apparently the Note has a bug or something that makes it so I have to wait 72 hours regardless. Google rep proceeds to tell me that Verizon can reset my phone remotely and just push a new copy of the OS, circumventing the 72 hour wait period. I proceeded and called Verizon again and asked if they could do the reset. No. Apparently only Asurion (the insurance company Verizon works with) can do that. Asurion can reset and do stuff to your phone that Verizon can't. 
Is there any Note 5 cases similar to the Note 4 protective cover? 
Just got the Note 5.. Touchwhiz is pathetic. I had a Oneplus One which I passed on to my wife.. Cyanogen Mod is wicked - so much customization. I don't want to lose the functionality of the stylus etc. but I really hate touchwiz. Am i stuck with the stock firmware or do I have options?

No Gear VR for Note 5? This article implies it's only for S6 and S6 Edge. Maybe the old Gear VR will work with the Note 5?http://www.engadget.com/2015/08/19/samsung-gear-vr-innovator-irl/
Support for uk 4G? Been using my note 5 for about 2 days and I've noticed that my 4G isn't working but my calls and texts are. I'm in the UK so is that maybe the reason that it doesn't support 4G? My provider is Giffgaff and my phone model is N920i
Spotify randomly quits? Has anyone else had issues with Spotify randomly closing? Even while actively playing music? I'm not sure if this is a problem on Spotify's end or Samsung's, but I want to say it could be related to the aggressive memory management.
Verizon Android Pay Question I was reading that the Verizon Note 5 doesn't have Samsung Pay.  Does the Note 5 on Verizon still work with Android Pay?
Is it safe to assume the same roms that are already available for the S6 will become available for the note 5? Hey notetinos! I'm considering grabbing a note 5 around the end of the month, when my plan is up, but coming from a nexus 5 which is I've rooted and installed custom roms on pretty much from the moment I owned, I'm a bit worried that I'll get an itchy flashing finger with the note and want to root/flash etc. I know there will be less in the way of custom rom development for the note 5 due to the Exynos processor, but there seems to be some pretty cool looking roms for the S6 already and I think I could live with something like that on my note 5.Anyway, as far as I can see there's not really any custom roms yet, but I guess that's a lot down to root still being pretty limited (I think?) so I'm hoping in time that will change. Thoughts?

Note 5 GPS Issues Hey folks!  As of this week, I've been having issues getting a good GPS signal on Google Maps.  In the pull down menu, it continually says searching for GPS and the phone can't tell which direction I'm facing either.  Has anyone had this problem before?  Thanks!
How do I turn off/disable Samsung Pay? I enabled the Samsung Pay app in order to take advantage of the free charger deal, but I am finding it annoying having that app always running, and wanting to swipe up from the bottom. I only want to use this app when I choose to use it and only want to use it when I specifically open the app.Has anyone been successful in turning it off? I've turned off NFC, selected Android Pay as my default Pay System, tried force closing...is there a successful way to get this to turn off?

Samsung Galaxy Note 5 User Guide 
Looking for a good case.... I'm finally upgrading my S3 to the Note 5 today and I'm looking for a cool case to protect the phone. I have a Game Boy case for my S3 so I'd be looking for something alternative from a regular case, but if there's nothing then I'm cool with just a normal, solid case. I prefer rubber cases but again, I'm open to any quality option.I've scoured Amazon and Google and not really come up with much, so if anyone could point me in the direction of somewhere where I could find quality cases that are retro or something like that, that would be awesome. Thanks.
Where are the large S-Note widgets? This is what a action memo looks like right now: http://i.imgur.com/dIQGQi6.jpgIt is not resizeable. Here is what it apparently looks like on a Note 4 (see the third screen): http://phandroid.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/note-4-home-screens.pngI would like the large notes to be visible. Any ideas? 
Bezels Be Damned One of the biggest selling points for me on this phone was its looks, and that was due in large to the tiny bezels, truly making it an edge to edge screen. But in my hunt for a nice slim case, I'm finding the lack of bezels to be an issue! Due to the slight overhang on the front of the device from the cases, swiping in from the side is damn near impossible. So far I have used the super basic Insignia (best buy house brand) and the Spigen SlimFit. Anyone else running into this? Anyone have a very slim case that doesn't interfere, pretty much has to have very little lip on the front of the device.

International Note 5 band 12 Hello,I bought the international unlocked Note 5. I know the phone supports band 12 but I'm unsure if this is disabled from the factory. I'd like to use the phone on T-Mobile and with them removing the bands from phones like the Moto E I'm unsure if the same happens on this model Note 5. I'm not concerned with not having VoLTE on Band 12 as I use Google Voice primarily and Band 12 is fine for VoIP.

Root/Xposed questions I'm looking forward to getting one of these but I can't see myself using it full-time without at least root access (and preferably Xposed too). I'm still new to a lot of this Android dev stuff so I'm wondering, is work done towards getting these working on the S6/S6E likely to carry over to the N5 and get them working here faster? If that makes sense.And as a related question, how likely is it there'll be a workaround for using Samsung Pay with a tripped Knox counter? Is that something that just isn't possible or are there ways to reset Knox/fool the system into thinking it's still set?
Only sporadically receiving email notifications on Note 5. Help? So all I would like to be able to do is receive a notification when I receive a message in my gmail.  This is only happening sometimes.  I get notifications when I get messages from school in my gmail.  But I don't receive notifications when I get dating site messages even though my setting on the site are all good.  Makes no sense.  Sometimes I send messages to my gmail from my phone through the text messenger and sometimes I get the Gmail notification right away and sometimes not all.  What's going on?

Smart Lock not working with Note 5 (att branded, latest software) Anyone else have a problem with Smartlock working on the Note 5? I use fingerprint unlock and I have tried pin unlock but I still have to input to unlock the phone.  I came from a Moto X 2014 and when I connected my Moto 36to it I never had to input a code. I've paired this with the bluetooth on my watch, car and my Amazon Echo and none actually work.  Anyone else having issues?EDIT  -- Fixed the issues, seems to involve my college using exchange for email and permissions allowed on my phone after I setup their email on it.  Removing the account from my phone fixed the issue, not sure if there's a workaround but that did it.
New to the note5, have a few questions! hey guys!Just got my note 5 last night! I'm loving it so far! just have  a few questions.1) im having an issue with redeeming the samsung pay offer. I set up my card (chase) and its done. but when i enter the information i get the error: Im sorry your imei and/or mac address were invalid i've tried to fix this but nothing works. any help with it would be appreciated.  2) on my note 3, if i held the recent button it popped up with menus. on my note 5 i dont see how i can do this. especially on sync for reddit where i used this button to access the menu button where i could search posts and that sort of thing.   3) is there any way to have more than 1 fingerprint?  4) how is rooting the note5 (im on tmobile, preferably if knox isnt tripped)Anyway, this phone has been amazing so far.

Samsung Galaxy Note 5: 3 Killer Features that Make it the Best Smartphone of 2015 
Help restoring my N920T (T-Mobile) to stock. Almost immediately after purchasing my Note 5 I decided to root it and install TWRP. That went pretty smoothly, but since then I've noticed some odd performance behavior: poor battery life (less than 1hours normal use), spontaneous reboots, SIM card not detected messages, and keyboard lag. My friend advised me to do a full system reset (unroot, stock recover, etc). I've followed a few tutorials, and so I've tried to use ODIN v3.10.7 to flash an OTA. I've made sure that ODIN detects my device in download mode, loaded the appropriate file in AP, and have all the correct options checked. Still, I cannot get it to pass.Thanks in advance for your help! :)Here's a transcript of my log, if that helps:&ltID:0/007&gt Added!!&ltOSM&gt Enter CS for MD5..&ltOSM&gt Binary Check MD5..

Fingerprint sensor stops working when it wants to. Forces password entry instead. Anyone else? So this morning my alarm went off and I went to disable it. Couldn't. Phone wouldn't read my fingerprint. I was half asleep and couldn't remember whatever password I had setup as the backup to the fingerprint. Ended up being able to sign in through Google. This is the second time this has happened to me. The first time was Monday during class (I'm the instructor) and I had some bullet points on Google Keep that I was addressing with the students. Phone shut off. Couldn't get back in. Had to sign in through Google. I need to make and remember a backup password that sticks, but I shouldn't have to. My GF had the same issue with her GS6E+. And though I should have known my password (I can usually figure it out), she's notorious for forgetting all hers. I'm guessing there's a faulty fingerprint sensor that trips up on these phones.Just thought I'd share.
Note 5 owners: would you ever consider switching to an LG G4? I'm well aware of the bias brought on by asking such a heretical question here, but I've also posted to /r/LGG4 with a similar question!Would you ever consider going to a G4? Is the display *that* much more enjoyable on a Note 5? Is your S Pen too invaluable to drop for a removable battery, expandable storage, and an IR blaster?Has TouchWiz improved past the point of being a clunky mess of a UI?The build quality seems to be more pleasing to the eye than the G4, but I really don't enjoy TouchWiz. Multi window apps does seem awesome, though.The wife and I are getting new phones next week, and I just can't decide between these two phones. The last Samsung device I've owned was an S4, and while I enjoyed the display, it couldn't compare (for me) to the LG G2.Thanks!
Can anyone share pictures of your case and/or skin?

Is It Possible to Tether While on WiFi? I know this sounds odd, but a friend put his WiFi password in my phone without telling me what it is, and then left.  I am here for 3 days alone, and cannot connect to the network on my computer without the password.  He is hiking and without a phone.

DAE have crazy wifi issues? I have a great router at home that gets terrific range/signal in each room. All of my previous Galaxy devices (tabs and phones) have never had an issue getting a signal. But since I've had the Note 5, I have to be 1feet away from the router to get full bars and speed. I've held the phone in all different ways. Used different cases/no case at all. Made sure there was no channel interference. Factory reset both my phone and router to start from scratch. I've done it all, but it still persists. Any ideas? (btw, this problem also happens with my work and other wifi)
Does a case make this phone too big? Hey guys, im thinking of buying the phone but my biggest problem is how large the screen is, Im coming from the Iphone 5 and I have small hands so the fragile design of the phone means that im worried that the first time I drop the phone will cost me big bucks, so I was wondering does putting a case on the phone make it too big or is it still manageable?

Currently, I have to hit the power button and then scan the fingerprint.Thanks!
Samsung pay now searchable in the play store for verizon 
Not available with T-mobile pre paid? I've just spent nearly an hour trying to upgrade my phone.  Bare with me...I went to a T-mobile store to look at a Note 5 in person and ask some questions.  They didn't have a 64GB model and I was told no stores had them and they didn't know when they would get them in.  But they could order one for me.  They got busy and I left to just order it online.I went online and after putting it in my cart I was asked to choose a plan.  I don't want to choose a plan.  I have a pre-paid plan with them.  $3gets me Unlimited data (Up to 5GB at 4G) Unlimited text and 10voice minutes.  Perfect for someone that doesn't talk on the phone a lot.  I tried their chat.  I assume it wasn't someone that spoke English very well because some of their responses hardly made sense. And they told me to call for help.  So I called.  I was bounced around for 45 minutes and talked to 8 people.  From sales, to pre-paid and back again.  Finally someone (person #8??) said, I can't do this for you here.  You need to switch to a post-paid plan. But they couldn't match the $3plan, only the $5plan which is only 1GB.  I do go over that amount sometimes.  Then she said I could just go in the store and have them order it for me.... WTF??  Anyone know what the deal is with this?  I really don't want to give up my sweet $3deal.  I'm fine with buying the phone outright.  Is it possible to buy the Note 5 outright, and use my prepaid plan?I'm coming from a dev edition unlocked Moto X (2013) if that matters.  I had issues with T-mo getting them to set that phone up too.Advice?***EDIT**I went to another store.  No way was I going to make another phone call explaining everything.  Store#2 also didn't have the 64GB version, but the salesguy said he'd order it for me.  He went to the register, took mr CC and BAM.  Credit Card not valid.  Wait, what? Try it again?After three tries, I thought maybe my card had a security block on it because of the large purchase.  So I had to call the CC company.  They said nothing was wrong with my card, it was the merchant.  So the guy said he had 32GB Note 5's in stock that he could ring up right now.  But for some reason he couldn't place an order online for the 64GB version.  He wasn't sure if it was his system or not...So on my way home from work tomorrow I'll try again.  Does T-mo not have the 64GB in stock to sell and maybe they are on backorder??  I'm tempted to just grab a 32GB and deal with it.
Spotify cutting out Not sure is a note 5 issue or a Spotify one, but it only happens on this phone, but whenever I use Spotify in anyway, through headphones, Aux or out loud, after a few songs it just stops playing, not paused like just stops? 
Just received an update on T-Mobile! 
Ram Management My note 5 is constantly running with like 75% ram used. I can't get this down  whenever I clear it it just shoots back up. I already disabled as much as I could. T-mobile my account is not able to be removed. Is there anyway to get this down?
Why are the White and Silver Note 5's not available in my country? (New Zealand) In New Zealand, the only colours anyone has in stock is Black and Gold.Unsure of the relevance, but the N920I is the version in my country.
Can't qualify for Samsung pay!? So I opened an account with Bank of America recently so that I could take advantage of Samsung pay since my credit union card wasn't accepted with Samsung pay. The app needed a way to verify my identity and gave me the option to call BOA to verify. I call them up and they told me that I couldn't use Samsung pay because of my age and that I didn't have any credit or public records to go by. They weren't helpful in telling me what my next steps were in hopefully using Samsung pay.    I'm 18 and well I don't really know what to do now. Any help is greatly appreciated!
FYI: You can activate Samsung Pay with the screen off by swiping from the bottom of the screen! I thought this was pretty cool and that I should share it.
Samsung teases the Galaxy Note 5 as we approach Samsung's 2015 Galaxy Unpacked event 
IR Blaster? Why would samsung remove this feature?  the various leaks and rumors make it sound like its gone.  I find this surprising, since a lot of people rely on their smartphone to run their TV for chromecasting, etc.  It's also a real game changer if you are in an area where you don't have access to the TV remote, like the waiting room of a doctor's office, the DMV, or something like that.Very surprising to me.
Random audio crackling/spiking I've noticed the audio playback on my new Note 5 is not quite what I'd expect out of a ~$70device. Every so often (can be anywhere between a few seconds to a few minutes), the audio will spike, almost like what you'd hear on a scratched up CD. Sometimes it's subtle, other times it can be pretty loud. If I go back and play the same song again, it doesn't play the same spike at the same parts of the song. The issue is still present even if I have headphones or speakers plugged into the audio jack.Is anyone else experiencing the same issue? I've tested numerous audio playback apps and songs, and the only thing I've noticed is that the issue seems to only be present with .mp3 files with a variable bitrate (which is a good chunk of my library, because I usually downsample from 320/lossless), though I haven't tested it quite enough to be 100% sure of that.I've honestly got no idea whether this is a hardware or software issue. Or perhaps a little of both. EDIT: Ok, I'm pretty sure it's exclusively mp3s with variable bitrate, as I've been testing it with various songs and the only ones that have the issue are mp3 vfiles. I've also tested audio playback on two other Samsung phones: an S3 and an S5, and neither of them have any apparent issues with audio playback, variable or constant.To any other Note 5 owners, I would really appreciate it if somebody could test it out for themselves to see if they have the same issue. I'm not sure whether it's a hardware issue with my phone, or something that's affecting all Note 5's.

No 64GB models at VZW retail locations? My closest three VZW stores, which all seem to be run by the same group of employees, have been telling me that I can't exchange my faulty N5 in-store because they only offer the 64GB model online. I don't believe that, and when I call CS, they insist that the retail stores do have them and that the employees are being lazy. I already exchanged the first one due to a pink tinted display now the replacement is having issues. Tomorrow is the end of my return period, and I'm basically being told I have to settle for a 32GB model or just return the bad 64GB model and be SOL. The manager claims that there isn't enough demand for 64GB phones. Anyone happen to pick up a 64GB model at a VZW retail location? 32GB seems like a mistake.TLDR: Do you know if the Note 5 is offered in 64GB at Verizon stores?
Verizon note 5 Samsung pay update? Has anyone on Verizon with a Note 5 actually gotten the update for Samsung pay? A lot of articles saying the updates were rolling out now, but so far I've only been seeing people with  S6 variants saying they've actually gotten the update.
Charger problems...always cable charging Whenever I use the charger (that came with the phone) I have to constantly plug and unplug it until it says fast charging.  I'm at the airport and the first time I plugged it in, it said fast charging and the tip of the microUSB got super hot so I freaked out and unplugged it.  WTF is going on?  What's the easiest way to handle/fix this?  I'm on T-mobile BTW.  Appreciate your insight!
Looking to get Galaxy Note 5 Help I'm in Canada and there is no 64 gb on any carrier. Is it possible for me to get a 64 gb model unlocked for Wind Mobile?When is the Silver Titanium colour coming out?
Wireless charger not working So I bought this [iOttie Easy One Touch Wireless Qi charger](http://smile.amazon.com/iOttie-Wireless-Standard-Motorola-Smartphones/dp/B00UXS7958/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top?ie=UTF8) and it doesn't seem to be working.  It lights up but when I put my phone in, nothing.Is there any way I accidentally disabled wireless charging?  I was pretty heavy handed with package disabler pro but I don't see anything in there about charging.  I'm guessing either the charger or my phone is messed up but I have no way to test either as I don't have another wireless charging pad or phone with it.   Might just swing by Best Buy some time before my 14 days is up and see if they can test either one for me.  Just thought someone might have some insight, I'm a bit of a wireless charging noob.Edit: did try enabling everything in package disabler pro and no luck
Possible to find a white 64gb Note 5 in stock in T-Mobile stores? I know they have the Black (blue) and Gold in stores but I am not sure where to find white or 64gb for that matter.

For those of you checking this sub about the loss of battery and sd card option. Here are my thoughts coming from an s4. [deleted]
Issues dialing numbers... I can't figure this out.  Sometimes after I dial a number and hit send...the number vanishes and no call is made.  I'll have to re-type it and hit send again.  I've also encountered an issue when using voice commands to call people.  I tell it to call and it starts, but never actually places the call.  It just stops.  The phone has been factory reset and it has made no difference.  Any ideas? 
Glass protector with no halo. Is the zagg still the only one that doesn't leave a halo? I have had the xtremeguard glass protector on my phone for a few weeks and it already cracked on the edge due to it being lifted off the screen just slightly. I would love one that just fit right. The zagg is definitely more than I would like to spend but if it's the only option I have no other choice.

Has Anyone Gone From A Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge (Plus) To A Galaxy Note 5 ? Any regrets ?
Question about the S-Pen sensor. I was going to attempt to fix my friends Note 5 S-Pen sensor because of his weird situation. So he was able to wiggle it free without breaking the S-Pen but also not entirely breaking the sensor. His phone now thinks the S-Pen is out. So all the features work except the notification when you pull your pen out. I personally found that annoying and turned it off on mine.So his phone technically works like mine but does not know when the pen is back in. From reading I believe that his spring / sensor is some how bent down? Signaling the phone that the pen is always out of the phone? Should I open it up and try to slightly bend it back if it shows enough elasticity? I know if its bent too much inward, it  might break and think that the pen is always in and have the S-Pen not work at all.

S-Pen lasso and copy text gone? EDIT: It's still there. Just hold the S-Pen button while selecting the text. A copy dialogue appears. (thanks 3rd and Dong lol)On the Note 4, if there was text on the screen (i.e. a phone number) and you wanted to copy it, you could use the S-Pen if tapping and holding with your finger didn't work.I just tried it with a phone # (wanted to copy from a classified listing and paste into Hangouts to text the person). I lasso'd the text and don't see a copy function. This was definitely on the Note 4.Am I doing it wrong or did Samsung remove this highly useful feature? (to comply with copyright demands?)
Google Docs and Spen? I used to use Google docs on my S4 all the time. I just tried it for the first time on my note 5 and it works great.... Then I took out the spen and every time I would hover over the screen the phone would vibrate making it unable to be used. Had anyone wise experienced this problem before? I would love to use the spen to edit documents in my drive folder. Thanks
Is it possible to update an unlocked AT&ampT Note 5 outside of the US?

New S Pen Mini-Review: Why is this Stylus Better, and Why Should You Care ? 
Just bought a Note 5, and I have a few questions. It's a wonderful upgrade from my dying HTC M8, but am I being obtuse about a few things?I can't really save images from Google Image search.  The images loads up, but no matter how long I tap on the screen, no save option appears.  I have to actually surf to the webpage to save it.Also, what is the default music player?  On my M8 there was a basic app called Music that played all the songs on my phone.  Do I have to use Google Music?  That thought doesn't really appeal to me.Thanks for all your help!

Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Drop Test - FROM 90FEET! 
A few questions 1. When using the S-Pen to edit/draw on pictures, how do you get the save button to disappear, so you can more easily draw on the lowest portion of the screen?2. When pinching the phone between my sholder and ear while on a call, the screen tends to flicker on and off, as though the phone can't tell it's still pressed against my head. Is there anyway to up the sensitivity for this? It's pretty annoying to be on a call, need to use both hands for a second and wind up dialing a string of random numbers with my face.

Samsung Pay and SmartCards I have been searching for hours on this but I am trying to figure out if the hardware/tech that powers Samsung Pay can be used with other kinds of smart cards...the kind you would use for 2-factor authentication or message/file encryption. There are some Dell laptops that have both NFC and contactless smart card readers for this purpose. All of the search results come back talking about what banks/credit card companies work with it but I am specifically looking for card hardware types. I think it would be neat to be able to load a CAC (common access card) in to Samsung Pay and use my fingerprint to authenticate the card to my reader for login or message encryption for work. Thanks in advanced!
Weird lock screen activity. Today, I pulled out my phone and saw that my screen was black, except for the clock being shown in white at the bottom of the screen. All that it was displaying was the time. I had no idea that it could do that, so I tried to recreate it. It happened again, but it went back to my normal lock screen before I could take a screenshot of it. I also looked around in the settings and couldn't find anything about it. Has anyone else experienced this or have any idea what it could be?

What can I do?EDIT: I feel dead inside lads...I loved my S Pen...
Returning My Second Note 5 I RMAed my first Note 5 for a variety of issues. Second model has the same and even more.-Battery life is awful. Cell standby bug zaps my battery until its dead. When using this phone on Wi-Fi and medium brightness, I seriously lose about 1% battery life every minute.-Frequently loses cellular data connection. On Verizon. Have to reboot the phone to get it back.-Weak signal. In my house I get 1 bar, sometimes EDGE network.-Drops bluetooth signal periodically. Forces me to repair my fitness tracker, cuts out when using bluetooth headphones.-Google Play Music is horrific and buggy. One of my most used apps.I've been a long-time Samsung users. I've owned the Galaxy S, Note 2, Note 3 and now this phone. But I'm done. How can such an expensive phone be so cheaply made? Highly disappointing.
Let's talk wireless quick charging compatible devices Here is what we know.  Samsung announced wireless quick charging, a technology that combines quick charging with wireless charging. They have a compatible device up on their site.  http://m.gsmarena.com/samsungs_fast_wireless_charger_is_now_up_for_grabs_for_6999-blog-13602.phpI can't see paying that price.

Is there a way to alpha-sort icons inside of folders in stock TouchWiz?

I know that Nova can do all that but I am really trying to be fair to the new TW on the Note 5 and not have to switch launchers so quickly.

ABYSMAL battery life on new Verizon Note 5? Hey! Just upgraded from an HTC One M8 (which I could squeeze two days worth of juice out of) and now I can barely get 8 hours with my Note 5!My battery drain is about 10%/hour in standby, wifi, bluetooth, location and everything else off. From my battery statistics page, it says Google Play Services is hogging like 60% of all of my battery function. What can I do? Any packages you recommend to disable?For reference I could get maybe 3 hours of use out of the phone before it's dead :(
Notifications I've had my N5 for two weeks now and yesterday I noticed that I don't seem to get notifications when my phone is locked and asleep.

Samsung Pay free wireless charger arrived, still doesn't work right. **TLDR** New wireless chargers only charge to 100% and then start to discharge the device.I was excited when Fed Ex delivered my Samsung Pay promotion free wireless charger.  I thought, ok, first thing, let's test this bad boy out and see if it will work as a bed side charger. Referring of course to the reports (and experiencing it myself) that some wireless chargers will charge up to 100% and then stop charging so that the battery starts discharging for the rest of the time the device is on the charger.Well, my phone started at 85% then charged up to 100% and then the blinking blue light occurred and the phone screen says it is no longer charging.I'm on the phone with Samsung support right now.  The representative offered to let me mail them the 3 chargers that I now have that do not work properly with my Samsung Galaxy Note 5.  The solution she says is to replace them all.   I asked how replacing 3 brand new chargers with 3 more new chargers will solve the problem?Her answer, That's the policy.**UPDATE:** Spoke to the next guy higher up the chain, his response, That's a feature to save the battery in your device.  It is supposed to stop charging once it reaches 100%.Spoke to the next guy higher up the chain, his response, Yes sir, that's the way the product is designed.  It has a chip inside to make the charger go into standby mode when the phone is fully charged.
Best cheap MicroSD OTG Drive for the Note 5? So since we no longer have expandable storage and 4K videos take a ton of space, I was thinking of picking up a MicroSD OTG drive since I want to be able to use my 32GB MicroSD from my S4. What is a reliable brand that's still under $1or so? I have free 2 day shipping on NewEgg but I wasn't sure which brand was more reliable and I saw many on Amazon but the shipping makes it cost like $2for the Dash Micro I had my eyes on.

Note5 WiFi not working Brand new, 1 day old. All other devices on home network work great. Asus rt66u router, Time Warner Internet. Issues on both 2.4ghz and 5ghz. Based on some articles, I've tried the following. Rebooted router, cleared phone partition cache, and turned off smart network switch. No luck. Restated phone and factory reset. No luck. It shows that it's connected and has signal, but no app/browser can get anything from the Internet. Once I switch to mobile network, works great (but racks up my data usage on my plan of course). WTF?Edit: I also applied all app updates and the 1 system update. It's on 5.1.1.
100% Battery How long after unplugging from a full charge does your phone stay on 100%?  Seems like mine almost immediately drops to 99%.  Battery has been fine, but seems to have gotten worse now.  I have taken all the usual steps to keep drain at bay.  When my phone isn't in use at all the battery is a champ and barely drops any power.  Any use at all though starts to tick away at the battery quickly.  All I really do is look at Reddit is fun and text messages. 
Just Got a Note 5, Two Issues Has anyone experienced these before?1. When I'm talking to someone on the phone, and they're talking loud, they sound almost tinny I guess.

Took the plunge and pre-ordered mine from sprint. Upgrading from the lgg3. I love the new digitizer, and my battery life sucks on the g3, no matter the rom/kernel combo I tried. I'm always near outlets and with fast charging I think I'll be ok. I just want 4-5 hours of sot.Anyone else take the plunge? 
Downloading/Uploading account for large portions of battery drain. Hey folks,Everything is working great on my Note 5.  I actually get amazing battery time in nearly every scenario.  The only time my battery really suffers is downloading and uploading.  I'm not talking about idle drain I mean when you go to download an app or upload a photo, the amount of battery used is huge.Does anyone else have this experience?  Was this common in all phones and I just didn't notice? For example, in 8 hours, I lose 45% of my battery with 2 hours of screen on time.  1percent of that is data transfer, yet I only downloaded/uploaded a total of 165 Mb on Wifi, which would take all of about 2 minutes if done together.
Test driving the Galaxy Note 5... looks like I'm going to switch from an iPhone, but have questions. I've been test-driving the Galaxy Note 5 through Samsung's test drive program (coming from an iPhone 4S) and it looks like I will switch, but have some questions.1) What is the best way to get my iTunes music onto the GN5 in a very Galaxy-friendly way? (I've heard about Google Play Music, but I've heard it eats up a lot of data as it plays the music from the cloud.)2) How long would the GN5 probably get updates for? The 4S got updated for 4 years, and I've heard Android devices can be updated from none at all to even two years.3) What would be the best way to sync contacts between the GN5 and Mac?4) Security/privacy... I know Samsung has KNOX on top of Android, but does KNOX provide any increase in security for most users over following good Android practices? (i.e., Only install applications from the Play Store or other approved sources, etc.)Any other comments?
Searching for sim card My phone keeps saying randomly that my sim is missing then restarts and finds it...

I'd really like to get it in silver!
Samsung Galaxy Note 5 specs leaked, no microSD 
Opinions on buying a used note 5 ? I am currently in the market of a new phone.  I  have an iphone 5 so I am really searching for an upgrade. I found a used note 5 for 600$ on my local classifieds. I can still sell my iphone 5 for 200$ so i will be paying around 40for the note. I live in Canada so i really don't want to have to buy a new phone considering how low our dollar is and the high taxes. What do you note 5 owners think of this deal ? From what I have seen in /r/android people seem to dislike the new Samsung phones this year. 
fucking hell i bootlooped it trying to install twrp with ODIN, i did all the steps right but i went into recovery mode and i didn't have TWRP. I hit 'reboot' and all i see is the Samsung Galaxy Note  5, powered by android over and over. im on t mobile by the way. anyone know a fix? thanks
Is it stupid I am considering this phone because I love Samsung pay? I am bummed about the no SD card and also non removable battery, but the MST/NFC payments got me hyped.Is it stupid to want to get this phone for that being a primary reason? I honestly hate carrying my wallet around. I want to just have Samsung pay and my Driver license behind my case.How is MST and NFC payments going for the beta testers? I saw that it works at target (my go to store, in Portland, OR) any complications with the payment there?
Continuous cycling through screens? [deleted]
Anyone considering the Moto X pure or nexus? I still have another week to return my note 5 and a few upcoming flagships interest me like the nexus and moto x pure.  Stock Android on the nexus interests me but I also like many of the features the note 5 offers like the battery life, one handed use, the camera, the display. The moto x has pretty close to stock but also has moto voice and the touch less voice controls has always interested me. Anyone else waiting to see what else comes out this month or next? 
Best Quick Charge External Batteries? I just need some recommendations for good external batteries that have quick charging.
Power button problem? Got my Note 5 last week after my S4 met an untimely death due to douche bags at a gas station (another story for another time). The first few days everything was great, but the power button has started to malfunction. At first I couldn't use it to turn my screen off (which, while annoying, I could live with). Then it progressed to bringing up the restart/shutdown/airplane mode menu whenever it was pressed. Over the last 48 hours, the button has started to stick in the pressed position. It hasn't caused any operational problems yet, but I'm going to bite the bullet and take it to get it replaced later today. Has anyone else had this problem? Google didn't return many results when I searched for the problem online so I'm hoping it's just a hardware issue with this particular phone.
AT&ampT note 5 vs international Hey guys I'm looking for some advice. Currently I own an AT&ampT note 5 and I managed to get the international version as well.

Note 5 screen issue Hi!My note 5 has a display problem. The top part of the screen (approx.1/8 of the whole screen http://imgur.com/5iba3hF ) is unresponsive.

Samsung giving wireless Charger till Nov 8th for those who activate Samsung Pay [US Only] [deleted]
Why don't I see a Samsung pay app, and NFC not working I think when I first got my phone all the folders that it originally came with I deleted. I get pissed off at all the bloatware and got rid of everything preconfigured I can, and start from scratch. So now I don't see a Samsung Pay app to see if I can get it to work.Also whenever I try to go into setting then NFC and payment settings crashes on me and I can't get NFC to start working. I do have Package Disabler Pro, but it doesn't look like I disabled anything that would prevent NFC from not turning on.

Sprint Note 5 comes with free extra headphones? I just upgraded my iPhone5 to a Note 5 and at the sprint store the agent told me that there was a free pair of over the ear headphones included with the upgrade.  When I looked at the receipt it showed $25for the 32gb phone and $99 for the over-ear headphones.  Can anyone verify if this is legit or did I get scammed out of an extra $100? 
Wireless charger with nite ize steelie car mount? I have the steelie mount on the back of the my phone case and have to take my case off every  night to drop it on my charger. Has anyone modded their charger tof fit this mount?
Phone thinks it's connected (when it isn't) I'm at my wit's end, and I'm not sure what to do.  Hoping one of you might know something I don't.Beginning Friday morning, my phone thinks it's either plugged into the dock (flashing a ??Dock is now connected notification) or that a charging cord is connected (with a similar notification).  It then disconnects--since it wasn't connected at all.  It does this in very quick succession, up to maybe 2times a second.  It absolutely kills my battery life, since the screen doesn't turn off with the connecting and disconnecting, and makes the phone basically unusable.  I tried restarting and I tried a hard factory restart.  This got me about 2usable hours, but then it came back with a vengeance.  I thought it might be a hardware issue, so I plugged in a charging cord that's not plugged into a computer or wall with still no luck.I'm going mad here.  Anybody here with similar issues?  Anyone have any other ideas?  I may just have to send it back to Samsung and see what they can do under the warranty.For what it's worth, it's the 32 gb model on Sprint.
White 64gb Note 5 Verizon I really want a white note 5, but the 32gb option is too small for me. What's the best option for me instead of getting the black note 5? 
Should I get it?? Need your opinions! &ltoriginal note owner&gt Ive owned the original note (SGH-i717) ever since its release and its been a tank ever since (with the help of the otter box). Its been acting up recently with literally only 1 hour of moderate usage - ive changed the usb charging port three times (this past weekend was the 3rd). Even with the recent usb port change and with an extra battery , its still only letting me use for about an hour. Im ready to upgrade.Marques Brownlee made a pretty good review on it- only review ive watched so far. Only thing thats preventing me from pulling the trigger and making the purchase is the fact that there is no external storage and removal battery, the IR blaster i can live with out since I don't really know what its used for and never used it in the past.I wanna know what yall think so far, experiences, pros and cons, functionality for everyday use, ANY opinion will greatly be appreciated. I just don't know if I should just down grade to the spare blackberry that i have until the S7 releases or even wait until the Note 6 releases. Thank you for your time. 
Post your note 5 homescreens! The Note 5 is my first Android phone and I was curious to see how other people customize and design there homescreensIf you not comfortable with posting your home screen then maybe just the launchers  and themes you use.Inspired from a post from Android Central
Lockscreen wallpaper Whenever I make a plain black wallpaper it works fine for my home screen but the lockscreen always turns it into gray instead of black.Is there a reason for this that I'm not thinking of? I just want black, sounds so easy, lol
Looking to purchase a Note5 are there any deals out there right now? Posted this to the sprint, page maybe this is the better place.Last week Best Buy was offering a Gift Card for purchasing a Note5 on contract, two weeks ago BB was offering a Free Wireless charge, Before that they were offing both. This week when I decide to pull the trigger, nothing -_-, the only deals they have is $20of an iPhone with any smartphone trade. I really want the Note5 but do not want to pay $25for it under my contract. EasyPay would be a real pain, I have the money for the phone, I just want a deal!SamsungPromotions and Costco has nothing either.Does anyone know how I can get this phone discounted?Any help is greatly appreciated!
PSA: Your battery estimates are based on use over 7 days. A lot goes into your battery life, especially on Android.  Remember that, if you buy this phone new, and use it a TON on the first day, your battery estimates (time on battery remaining) will be significantly lower moving forward for the next few days.  Also, (someone please correct me if I'm wrong on this part) I'm pretty sure the battery makes estimates based on your current and previous usage, so your battery drain can seem aggressive when you're using the phone lightly if you've been using it heavily through the week, but should level out over time.  I know this was true for my Nexus 5, where the battery amount could even go UP at the low percentages if I didn't touch the phone.

Loving the Note 5 camera 
Fast wireless charging question I got the pad today, I was under the impression that it will give me something back similar to fast charging, but discovered that it takes around 1 hour 5minutes to charge the note 5 from to 10as per the videos on YouTube. However, my phone was around 25%, and it said that it will take around 2 hours 2minutes. Is this normal? Am using the stock charger that charges fast just fine.
I'm getting the Note 5 tomorrow and can't decide between the white or black version. Any thoughts from owners of either colors? Those who own the white one, do finger prints show up as horrible as the black version?   Has anyone else had the color dilemma? Is the black really nice when it hints the blue in it...in the light?
T-Mobile root question I have a Note5 on JoD and am interested in rooting/unlocking bootloader.  What's going to happen when I want to Jump later on and Knox is tripped?  Anyone have any experience with this?

Apple Music for Android Beta Review 
FYI If you use a Bank of America debit card with Samsung Pay Beta and aren't getting transactions logs or notifications, that's normal. BoA debit cards don't support this feature yet. [xpost /r/samsung] I've seen several Samsung Pay Beta testers saying they aren't getting transaction logs or notifications with their BoA debit cards on Samsung Pay. I've called both BoA and Samsung Pay support regarding this issue and Samsung Pay support gave me a definitive explanation... Apparently BoA debit cards do not yet support transaction logs or notifications (something BoA doesn't seem to tell their customers). So don't be worried if you are using a BoA debit card and are not getting these logs/notifications. I'm contacting BoA in the morning in hope that they will start informing their customer service reps about this issue.

Note 5 AMOLED Burn-in? The screen is beautiful, sharp and colorful, but im afraid of burn-in during heavy use of screen.I use a lot of gaming, skype, whatsapp, facebook and instagram where most of the elements are static. I have suffer burn-in before and i always try to stay very little time on statics images on my phone because of it.Should i give a shot to the note 5 (This could be the very first note i own) or buy another phone with LCD screen?
Touch screen problem So I'm having a problem after I updated my phone on sprint. After the update, when I unlock the phone it wont detect any touches on the screen. The s pen works but not my finger. If I lock the phone and unlock it a couple of time it will work fine. Anyone know of anything I can do to reaolve this problem?
Dear Samsung! Please give us a bundle on Note 5 + Samsung Orbis. Wouldn't it be amazing?!, I am excited fro the Note 5 and i also excited for the smartwatch too, but both of them together for a bundle (cheaper or for free) is even better.
Got a weird spam virus warning on my desktop pc, that also caused a warning beep on my Note 5. So, this is weird.  I was browsing the web using Firefox on my desktop pc. My Note 5 was on the desk, and connected via wifi to the same network as my pc.While I was texting my son, and not even using the pc, a popup message appeared that I had gotten a virus. The weird part is my Note 5 started emitting a series of what sound like warning beeps at the same time. Not a pattern that I recognized, nor any ringtone or other file that I had loaded on the Note 5.I could close out the virus message on the pc by closing the popup window - which also stopped the phone from beeping. I can't say I've ever experienced a popup computer message that also causes a phone on the same network to beep.Anyhow, here's the message and website that caused the problem:(note, I'm adding spaces in case the author of this message is trolling for hits)WARNING W I N D O W S   V I R U S   C H E C K  and then a couple of paragraphs of warning verbage.website: http://a p p w t c h g v e a w a y . c l u b / i n d e x . h t m l Any ideas?crp
Help: contextual menu, how to access it? Got my note 5 earlier today. While reinstalling my apps,  one of them required to access the contextual menu, which is usually located in the lower left if the device  (at least on my S4).On the note 5, this pops the application switcher.  A long press will open the multi-window mode.I tried doing long presses on other buttons but none popped the contextual menu. Any ideas? Thanks

Loading a custom rom vs Samsung Pay I didn't root my s6 edge and haven't rooted my note 5 just because i wanted to use samsung pay but ive been using it for a little now (since verizon just got it) and its more of a hat trick over anything.

Rooted then unrooted then screen randomly chooses to not turn back on after first button press So I recently rooted and then unrooted my note 5 and now I'm noticing that my screen randomly doesn't want to turn on when I press the home button or power button on the first try. I have to press either at least twice when this occurs to get the screen to turn on.It happens randomly, not all of the time. Sometimes it is fine then others I have to press the buttons multiple times. Ideas?
Has anyone had any luck getting Samsung to replace their phone after the 'design flaw'? And by design flaw, I mean accidentally inserting the pen backwards and breaking the mechanism. Aka Pengate.Share your experiences here with third party vendors and Samsung regarding this issue. Both Verizon and Samsung don't seem to want to help me.
ARGGHHH! I broke my Note 5's Camera lens! God damn it... high end phones are just not going well for me! I just broke my Note 5's Camera lens... like shattered it completely! It must have been punctured by the corner of a desk or something while I was at work.I managed to peel off the shrapnel of glass and i noticed the camera is still taking O.K. shots at a distance but it will not focus on any close objects and OIS for video does not seem to be working very well.Should I have the whole camera assembly replaced or should I just try my luck on the glass?Just came from a Nexus 6 which i broke the displays twice on about two months ago.

Note 5 not showing up in the Verizon website via their search bar or Devices category ~~Can anyone else see the Note 5 upon searching within the http://www.verizonwireless.com search? I tried clicking the devices menu and even there the Note 5 is not found.~~~~**Only when I tried Googling for the terms Verizon Note 5 that I find the direct link.**~~Even the Edge Plus is not there. Are they deliberately trying to hide it? To sell more s6 phones? To sell iPhones more? At this point, the concern is legitimate since everyone in the media virtually shuns anything that is not Apple and paints all the fear, uncertainty, and doubt, even Microsoft was not immune last week, despite their marvelous Surface Book launch.

OK Google voice detection with Nova Launcher? Hi there, new owner of a Note 5 and I'm trying to get Google voice search to work *when my screen is off* because I prefer it to Samsing's S Voice for numerous reasons. I'm told that Nova Launcher can do this via the OK Google hotword switch inside the gestures tab. I have that checked, and I also have the trusted voice option selected in the Google app settings. But this hasn't changed a thing - Google voice search still only triggers when the screen is on, or when the phone is charging. Any ideas? Does anyone else use this feature with Nova?
Getting a Note5 later this week! Background: I have had a Samsung s4 and then s5 for the past few years. I love the devices but wanted a size upgrade and like the note lines style (my wife has a note3).Low and behold we are upgrading and both are going to the note5 and excited about it. Anything I need to know? Any features you use that you weren't expecting to use and love. I'm excited about the S pen as a great feature. And being about to screen shot easily is exciting to me. Any tips. 
Low light photos How do the low light photos look from this phone? My note 4's camera gets extremely grainy in low light, and when I tried taking photos of the night sky all I got was black. Have low-light photos been improved in the note 5? Can anyone post some example photos?

Wireless charging woes with the galaxy note 5! Just wanted to share and see how others are faring with the Note 5 and wireless charging?I have two devices and samsungs fast wireless charger. While one charges without a hitch, the other (which happens to be my daily driver) keeps getting a wireless charging paused message within 3seconds of sitting on the pad.The device worked fine on the charger up until two days ago. Anybody else experiencing this? I'm using the same adaptor and USB cable found in the box and it's clearly an issue with the phone itself.EDIT: The device is being replaced. After further testing, I found that even with Daydream on the device does not wirelessly charge. Further more, even with the device powered off it does not manage to wirelessly charge for more than a few seconds.
Grabbing a note 5, selling LG G4 I think I'm getting rid of my LG G4 tomorrow. Not too crazy about the phone, I don't even know why I didn't wait a few months for the Note when I knew it was releasing. Love the look of it and the size.Anything I should know? I love Nova Launche so might install that when I get my Note 4. Is wirleess charging cheap? Or does is the piece expensive? I read headphones come with the phone, is this true? Thanks all! 
Slow WiFi I am on my second Note 5. The internet speed on my phone is atroicous, even though it pulls down the same speeds as my other devices. It doesn't make sense. I've tried resetting, clearing cache, resetting router, etc. Anybody have any help they could offer?
Going caseless for the first time. I've been experimenting with going caseless on my Note 5 for a whole month now. I have to say that I'm impressed with the overall caseless durability. There are no noticeable blemishes on the back glass at all. The front glass has had a nylon screen protector on it since purchase so I know the front screen is perfect.I've had a couple of drops onto carpet but nothing on concrete yet. I've noticed that I've been more careful with the device since I took the Defender off. I much prefer the vanilla look of the device over any case, even slim ones, that I've seen. Truthfully, the only physical problems I've had with it so far seem to be manufacturer related. The power button has lost the click that the volume buttons have and it becomes rigid unless I blow into it. Possible dirt, possible malfunction of the mechanism behind it. The second issue I have is with the magnetic link inside of the S-Pen holder. My pen comes loose with what would be the equivalent of a small, soft drop or bump on the bottom. TLDR: Went caseless and don't regret it... yet. 
Would anyone care to compile a comprehensive and detailed list of apps we can safely disable? An easy list is just anything carrier related and anything samsung related that you don't use - but sometimes it's a little tricky, disabling some apps can apparently slow down other apps in unexpected ways and maybe even drain battery faster. Because of this, I've always been hesitant to disable any apps. But I suspect we might get some advantage in terms of free RAM for the notorious multi-tasking limitation.
Having issues with Google Play Music and songs longer than 15 min Hey everyone, I'm hoping someone can help. I listen to a lot of classical music, and many tracks are relatively long (20+ minutes). I didn't have this problem on my previous phone and it works fine if I go through a desktop to play it, but when I try to play a song on my note 5 that's longer than roughly 15 minutes, it just loads forever and doesn't play.Any ideas? I've tried clearing data, removing and re-adding my account, downloaded the playlist, streamed it, even did a hard factory reset. Thanks in advance.Edit: It's a Sprint Note 5

I have a soft spot. Or, rather, my Note 5 does. It's on the back, 3/4 of the way down. There's a bit of give there when I grip it (TWSS). Tap on it and it sounds hollow, not solid like other parts. Nit picky as hell, but it gives it a bit of a plastic like feel and makes the phone feel less premium. It's a cliche, but almost $90after tax...I think we expect more. Screen problems too everything's tinted green,  and there are strange black parallel vertical lines on the lower right section of the screen. Looks like tiny railroad tracks. Viewing angles are awful. Already bought a replacement,  waiting to be unboxed, and the original is going back next week. I hope it was just bad luck,  because there's a lot to like here. Anyone else get a flimsy one?

Apple Lossless-&gtAAC automatic transcoding when syncing music... any way to do that?

Samsung Pay available to install on Note 5 I got my email about the Samsung Pay Beta earlier this week, but when I went into the app, I still had the 'coming soon' screen. Today i checked on it, and got the install button! Just wanted to let you guys know if you hadn't checked it lately.
Torn between Note 5 and Edge Plus. Hi there,I need some convincing, or advice, regarding which of these two devices I should get. I realize the edge plus doesnt use the curved screen to its fullest potential, and while notifications are nice, I'm really only considering this phone because it's so damn sexy, and gold.On the other hand, I'm also really wanting the Note 5, but after reading some things on this reddit (im on sprint) I fear the battery life may be really bad unless I disable a ton of things. But then again, the edge plus is essentially the same phone, so the battery life is probably very similar. 
Stuttering and general slowness with the Note5? So I really do like this phone. The camera is phenomenal and the build is great. However even after doing a factory reset a few weeks ago, this phone seems to have stuttering and general slowness at times. Sometimes it takes Google Messenger 4-5 seconds to open. There are frame-rate hiccups and things aren't as buttery smooth as I'd like.Power saver isn't turned on, and I've rebooted the phone many times. It's up to date software-wise and I don't have many apps installed - under 5I do believe. No Facebook app.Is anyone else experiencing a non-buttery user experience with this phone? Just generally curious. I really want this phone to be smooth like the Exynos chip should be.

Sticky Buttons Is anyone else noticing or having troubles with their note 5's power and volume buttons getting sticky, and getting difficult to press. I've returned one phone due to this issue, and now my new phone is having the same issue after only a week and a half.Just wondering if this is an on going issue with the phones, because I'm finding it hard to believe that a random fault on a phone would happen to me twice.
Is it safe to use an extension cord with the wall charger?

No need to leave NFC on with Samsung pay, it automatically toggles NFC for you. [xpost /r/android] This feature should be good for battery life and for those of us who don't want to be toggling it when we are going to make a payment. I just tested this at Walgreens because someone had asked me if SP turned NFC on automatically. I tested it by turning off NFC and making an NFC payment at Walgreens, the payment went through with no problem and afterward NFC was still disabled.
Few quick questions I currently have a Note4, and was thinking about upgrading to either the Note5 or S6 Edge / Edge Plus, as there's a black friday deal with my local (canadian) phone company that would make it a better deal for me (more data). Just have to sell my note 4 and it'd end up being about the same price I pay per month right now, for more data and a new phone.Of course the only downside is i'm stuck on a 2 year contract.All my previous phones have all been factory unlocked, so I never had to worry about stuff like unlocking and all this, and I never was in a contract for my phone plans.I have the option of the Note 5 (which im leaning towards), S6, S6 Edge, S6 Edge Plus. There's also iPhone 6/iPhone 6s but im not really a fan of iphones and theyre more expensive even with the $30off deal that is going on.Is there any spec differences between the S6, Edge and Edge+? I know the Edge+ is bigger so it has a 300battery, same as the Note 5. Will I have warranty? like if the parts aren't working I can get it repaired for free? I know most places if you drpo your phone yourself then your out of luck, or if you root your phone it voids warranty.What happens if your phone gets stolen? Can it be replaced?Im only asking cause this is a big step from note 4 (got it off a friend for cheap), as I always had 'cheaper' phones.Just looking for some advice before I make the plunge.
Terrible standby battery life. Does this seem right to anyone? FIXED*HI everyone. I am having some terrible battery life.  I went from 100% to 25% overnight with battery saver on. Can anyone else tell me what on the name of sweet chocolate Christ is draining my note 5?http://imgur.com/34bJLPyHI guys, Thanks for all the pointers but I managed to figure out it was a wifi issue by eliminating wifi all together, but I found a fix that works by adjusting some wifi settings and tested with wifi on. This time I went 100% to 93% overnight!http://imgur.com/34bJLPyHere is what I did.  1) went into service mode by typing *#0011# into the dialer, then turning on wifi power saver. http://imgur.com/34bJLPy2) went into wifi settings and turned off network notifications and always allow scanning. http://imgur.com/MOqvKCj3) charged up to 100% and unplugged as I went to bed. Went from draining 75% to 7% problem solved.  I hope this helps anyone else out.  I couldn't be happier, now if I could just fix my slow wifi speeds I would be content. 
Contacts unable to retrieve Hotmail contacts From the first day I used this phone, I've synced Gmail and Hotmail accounts with no problems. Emails and contacts sync as they are supposed to. Just today, I noticed, the Contacts apps just plain refused to retrieve/sync contact information from hotmail. And I lost all my contacts. I've checked in my Hotmail that the contact information is still there but it is not loading into my phone. I tried removing the account and adding it again but it doesn't work. Any idea why this is happening and a workaround? 
What's your favorite case for the Galaxy Note 5? I really liked the OEM case for the Note 4, so I was disappointed to see that the OEM case for the Note 5 offers much less protection.I'd prefer a case that's similar to the OEM Note 4 case, but feel free to mention any type of case that you like.
WTF happened to my Battery Settings? It disappeared. 
Finally, customized how I want it It took me a while, but I finally found the right combo of disabled packages, launcher, and screen on time. I'm loving this phone!http://imgur.com/a/egct4
S-Pen stuck inside unit *DESPITE* never being inserted backwards or incorrectly. Warning: Samsung support is USELESS First of all, I was having display issues with my Note5 where the sensitivity/accuracy was completely off - a particularly  big deal when attempting to type with the keyboard. This resolved on its own fortunately, however the real problem occurred when the stylus refused to come out. It's always been inserted the correct way, so I don't understand how it's stuck in there since it's *not* backwards! From the looks of it, the spring-mechanism on the stylus itself is broken so I can't eject it from the device.I contacted my carrier, who shipped me a replacement device....HOWEVER I only got the device itself (no accessories). You guessed it...the replacement *didn't* come with a stylus! After several calls I eventually ended up at Samsung support, who told me they do not carry the S-pen separately and literally asked me if I had checked eBay or amazon. They stated that the S-pen is an accessory and I'd have to contact the samsung accessory department. I don't agree with this, as the S-pen is really part of this phone (and is advertised as a part/feature!). After much arguing with Accessories they stated that they wouldn't have any shipments of S-pens for at least a month, and I may have to pay for it when they do. At this point I don't care and am willing to pay the $30, but this is absolutely pathetic. Apple would have handed me a brand new device already without dealing with all this bull****. So, if anyone's wondering, it is indeed possible for your S-Pen to randomly jam inside your Note5 even with proper use. Samsung support is abysmal at best...

Sketchbook for galaxy missing from the galaxy apps store? How's it going everyone, just wanting to see if this is an isolated issue with me or if everyone's sketchbook for galaxy is missing the the galaxy app's store from Samsung?It is listed that it is still offered on their webiste (http://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/galaxy-note5/galaxy-gifts/) however when trying to search for the app it is nowhere to be found...

App optimization in recent update So ever since the most recent update (T-Mobile) the app optimization that was added prompts me on what feels like a 12 hour basis to enable it to improve battery life.  I already decided I wasn't interested in using it and turned it off wholesale.  However, I still get that notification and it's becoming really annoying.  Is there any way to disable it permanently?
Thinking of switching to a Note 5, a few questions So I've had a Nokia Lumia 93for a couple of years and I've been seriously  considering getting a note 5.My question is, whats the battery life like? I have 4 emails, 3 of which are set to receive emails as they come, the other every 2 hours. I'm also on Reddit like 9minutes on my phone and the occasional half hour long calls along with hundreds of texts a day. on an average day, I go through a fully charged battery in about 14 hours. Is this achievable on the Note 5?Also, why do you love your Note 5?
S pen stuck backwards all the way. The only thing sticking out is the notches near the tip. [deleted]
Touchwiz tooltip help Just got my Note 5 last night. I did the test drive for Samsung and switched from iPhone. I am thoroughly pleases with my decision however, the tooltips are driving me nuts and I can't figure out how to disable them. These are the pop-ups that come up constantly even when you press okay, like the reminder about headphone volume, a reminder to clear app defaults, etc. Any help? And please, I have no desire to root. Thanks so much.
Constant vibration on note 5 Hi redditors ???, would like some help on my note 5.My phone just keep on vibrating every few 2 sec maybe when i receive a notification and the vibration would only stop when I see the notification. Would love some solution from you guys and I can't seem to find one on Google. Thx

Buzzing sound while playing music I'm sure this isn't a problem with this phone only, but when I am charging my phone and have an aux cord plugged in there is an annoying buzzing sound. This has happened with my astro headphones too when I plug an aux cord in. Anyway my question is does this happen to anyone else? Can I fix it?

Edge+ vs. Note 5 screens. There is a noticeable difference in quality between the S6 Edge+ and the Note 5. While the panels have the same specs on paper, their real-life effect is quite large. The Edge+ has a faint blurry grain to any flat colors and a barely noticeable fuzz to what should be crisp lines. The viewing angles are also pretty bad, especially on the curved edges, which distorts the colors along the sides of the screen. Hold one next to a Note 5, look really close, and you'll see what I mean. I ended up trading mine in for a Note 5. I compared several other Edge+ handsets, and they all exhibited the same lack of quality. Very disappointing.
I got hands on time with the Galaxy Note 5. I work at a cellular retail store in the United States. Samsung rep came in with a black bag. Inside was a galaxy note 5. 32gb memory no SD card option and no removable battery. Back class is curved nicely to fit your hand. I spent about half an hour with the device. I wasn't allowed to take pictures as I expected. The Spen has added features and the top clicks like a ballpoint pen for no other purpose than to provide satisfaction for fidgeters. It was a pretty cool experience.

S Pen falls out?! Anyone else having issues with the pen coming out without you pushing it? I've had a couple very minor drops of the phone with a case on, maybe a foot at the most and onto a hardwood floor but nothing major. Anyhow this morning I left for work and got the notification that the pen wasn't near. I never took it out last night. I'm baffled. Also it's popped out as if it's been pressed a couple times before too. I've noticed it and popped it back in thinking maybe I hit it or something but now I'm thinking it's possibly an issue with the phone, not me.
Note 4 or Note 5? Galaxy S4 Upgrade Hi,I've owned my S4 for about 2.5 years now, the longest I've ever owned a phone but my contract is up and its time to upgrade. I've done extensive research and considered almost every possible device and have come to the conclusion it's between note 4 and note 5. I've always had an admittedly dumb rule of never buying an older gen phone when a new one is available and I'm having trouble pulling the trigger on the note 4. I know that the note 5 has no removable battery, no SD card slot which I definitely need, and you can't take it apart which means repairing it for $5 myself is not possible as it was with the GS4 and as I imagine it would be with the note 4. Still, I'm having some fear of missing out on the 'best' new tech and a nicer screen. The other thing is also the software updates which I'm behind like 4 gens on at this point on my gs4. Still running KitKat.. Considering n4 doesn't have marshmallow yet.. I have no issue rooting. If I root, can I install the newest OS or will I have to wait for the releases? Note 5 users, should I pull the trigger on the 4 or is the 5 worth it? Maybe smoeone who's owned both can chime in as well!Thank you
Bunch of nice photos of the Note 5 - no IR blaster 
Google Calendar not syncing? When I put an appointment on my calendar using the desktop, it shows on my phone immediately. Vice versa, no. Appointments made on my phone do not show up on the Desktop Google Calendar app. I logged out an back into it on the desktop. I made sure I checked Accounts/Google on my phone and made sure Calendar was syncing, and then manually synced it. Again, appointments don't show up. Anyone else seeing this issue, or have any suggestions of settings to check? 
Debating whether to buy a Note 5 or a Note 4. Need feedback - Main concern is longevity. OK so in Toronto, Canada the Note 5 is currently priced at $36for a 2 year contract and the Note 4 is $20for a 2 year contract (so it's $16more for the Note 5). Reason for getting the Note 4 is mainly the removable battery and it is somewhat cheaper. Reason for getting the Note 5 is better build quality, new interface, it's the newest generation, newer s pen, etc., etc., etc. Now when it comes to the removable battery, I'm more interested in the increasing the lifespan of the phone and not having multiple batteries to bypass charging since I'm not a power user. I want to keep either phone for 4-5 years and not 2 years. I found out that the Note 5 battery can still be replaced just not by the user but can be done by Samsung or a skilled technician. The price for a Note 4 battery is $25, the price for the Note 5 battery is $6including labor as well. So really it is only an extra $35 I would have to spend every 2 years to prolong the life of the phone. I guess you can say that with the Note 4 it is less of a hassle to replace the battery and as well you can have multiple which I already mentioned that I do not need to have but it is an added bonus. If I go with the Note 4 then i'll already be one generation behind and it will get outdated fast in 4 years as there is a new release every year... Would appreciate any feedback regarding which phone to get and my plan to use Samsung/skilled technician to replace the non-removable battery. Thanks.

Slimmer clear case than spigen neo hybrid crystal (plus best tempered glass)? Hey dudes, got my note 5 today, LOVE IT! I got a spigen neo hybrid crystal case online, but I'm just not that happy with it. It's bulkier than I hoped it would be so I'd like a thinner clear case, any suggestions? Also, I bought a tempered glass screen protector from the optus shop (I expected it to have massive halo) and it has massive halo so I know there was a screen protector thread already but I can find it so suggestions for that too would be sweet. 
Note5 duos sim selection on notification shade Hi, I just recently bought a note 5 duos and have set my preferred sim for voice, and text and data in the sim manager. However I am not sure what the preferred sim for voice does as call buttons for both Sims are available in the dialer and similarly in messaging. Also, what does selecting a sim in the notification shade do? Thanks for your help! 
Will root simply be impossible on ATT and Verizon versions? I want to upgrade but from the looks of it, ATT and Verizon phones are screwed when it comes to root. I'm on ATT and my plan is not in a position where I could possibly buy the T-Mobile phone and use it on ATT. So will root just never happen?
No stock calendar widget on Tmobile Note 5? Just did a factory reset b/c package disabler somehow removed the stock messaging app which I want to test out. I noticed that there is no stock calendar app, which I was also interested in trying since it sounds like 'S Planner' used to have some useful features. Did samsung completely remove and stock calendar widgets or is this a Tmo issue?
Fast Charging Issue I recently noticed that my Note 5 wasn't fast charging every single time I plugged it in. I tried different outlets, messing around with power saving mode, etc. I tried everything. This morning I decided to use another USB cable to charge it. I found the cable that came with my Nexus 6. When I use that one, it fast charges every single time I connect it.I'm pretty sure the cable that came with my Note 5 is the culprit. Just wanted to pass this along in case somebody else was having the same issue.
Help! Stylus Stuck in Phone! Details Inside... My stylus is currently stuck in my phone the correct way. The tip is toward the top of the phone and the clicker is toward the charging port. The stylus top is about 1/8 below the edge and the clicker won't work. I dropped the phone earlier and the pen bent, so I bent it back into the straight positioning and the procedded to slide it back into my phone. Now I am sitting here showering the Internet trying to figure out how to get it out and have came here for the help. I am aware of the paper/plastic method but since I don't have anyway to grab ahold of the pen I doubt it would work. If you know of any way that doesn't void my warranty and doesn't require me to send it in, as I'm locked into a 2 year contract and I only get two warranty claims before my deductible jumps up to the point where I should just get a new phone. I just go this phone 3 weeks ago aswell.
Cracked my Note 5 back less than two weeks into the purchase. Who else cracked his/her Note 5? Who wanted a glass back in the first place? When I told the salesman I have second  thoughts about the glass construct of the phone, he told me: Just buy a case! So what the hell is the point of the premium build quality of I'll have to cover it with cheap ugly thick plastic to protect it from minor trauma? It baffles me that Samsung sacrifices exchangeable battery and SD card slot for something that is essentially a disadvantage.
Hands down the best picture I've taken with a mobile device 
Set to vibrate quickly On my S4 I could press the power button and there was an option to silent or vibrate the phone. But that option is longer there on the Note5. I am missing somewhere I could do this quickly without making a noise when adjusting the volume down?Edit, word n stuff

Question about Samsung Knox So I was an idiot and dropped my note 5. Glass on the back cracked. (The day before my case arrived too!) I'm a former iphone user so I'm pretty clueless about Samsung software. If I try to get the phone repaired by a local repair shop, will it trip Knox? From what I understand, it's a security program that has a fuse that trips when you try to root it, so a hardware repair won't be an issue, right? 
Lens over heart rate sensor scratched? I've had my Note 5 for about a week now.  I never actually got around to closely inspecting the phone until this evening.  After carefully removing the plastic from the lens over the heart rate sensor I discovered a scratch/crack.  It's very small and is right between the LED and the first sensor.  I don't think it effects performance at all, but I'm not sure if it'll get worse.  I've still got time to get a replacement from VZ if need be.  Thoughts? 
Question about S pen writing app When I was in the store looking at it, you could try out the s pen.  The writing application they had up made your handwriting look much neater but it still 'looked' like handwriting.  I got my note 5 but i dont see any 'neater' handwriting when i write with the pen.  Does anyone know what this app is or is there a setting to change to make this work?  I have US Cellular, GNote 5.  Thanks!
Question regarding screen protectors I can't find anything specifically stating that a tempered glass protector is the best option or not. Would the s pen work with a plastic protector? Or are my only options no protector or glass protector?I tried to search the subreddit and did some googling but couldn't find anything definitive. Maybe one of you have tried a plastic protector?Any input would be great since I plan on ordering these today so they get here when my phone does. Thanks!

Ok Google' always listening on Note 5? Recently picked up the Note 5 after two years with the Moto X and I love almost everything about it. One of my criteria for selecting a new phone was that it needs always-listening voice commands, ala the Moto X, which of course the Note 5 has via S Voice. However, I've come to find that S Voice is pretty clunky compared to Google Now. It's slower to respond, the voices are less natural (tried downlaoding the high quality ones and they still don't sound half as good as Google's). But the biggest issues is that it doesn't integrate as well with Android overall. For example, when I say What's the weather tomorrow? Google loads up the weather in the Google app which then lets me view extra information like the hourly precipitation. S Voice just fetches a lame little card from Accuweather with the high and low. For other questions it fetches cards from Wolfram Alpha. I don't want that, I want Google results! My question is if anyone knows any workaround to get Ok Google working when the Note 5's screen is off, so I can be rid of S Voice altogether? Of course I can use OK Google it when the screen is on, but I want always listening functionality. Seems like a long shot, but I figured I'd ask around in the off chance that it's possible through some app or rooting monkey business.

Broken S-pen Sensor It's not what you think. I have been using the S-Pen pretty heavily the past few days playing with  all of the features. It was working great. Earlier today I went to use it and it no longer gives me the s-pen detached notification nor any of the pop ups that it used to when detaching the s-pen.I double checked to make sure all the features were active and even booted my phone in safe mode and factory reset it just to make sure. It is still not working... Now I'm just banging the phone to see if that somehow works. Anyone else have any issue like this? All I can find online is the backwards S-pen scenario. Will be taking my phone back for a new one but was just wondering if this has been encountered by anyone else.tldr broken S-pen sensor that was not broken by putting in S-pen backwards.

Random calling So the last two nights in a row my phone has called my GF at 2am. I was up both times watching TV the phone was laying face down with the screen locked (I use fingerprint lock). I knew it called her because it freaked me out when her phone which was on the charger next to mine started ringing. I have no idea why it is doing this is there some sort of auto call feature I may have accidently setup or something?
Anyone here sent their note 5 in yet? Mine was sent in last week as it would not fast charge (with included cable and block) or connect to my PC via USB. I hope to save another soul from all the googling, downloading of strange software from forums that promise to help, and quadruple checking of Samsung drivers. Resetting the phone and erasing everything didn't help either.The service center in Los Angeles was kind enough to try and fix my issue, but realized their software update ( unique to them and different then over the air ATT ones) would not work because they can't see it on the PC either. Their verdict was that it's a main board issue and that only the repair centers can handle the fix. Mailing in takes 9-11 days average turn around...So if u are in the same boat with a main board issue, get your old phone ready for another round of use. 
Is an app using my camera? Does the wireless charger mess up your motion sensor? Hey everyone, have some strange things going on with my phone.1. Trying to take a picture through the Facebook Messenger app will black out occasionally.2.  My rotation/motion sensor doesn't seem to work always.Problem 1:So, could be a problem with the Messenger app, but occasionally when I open the apps camera to send a quick photo, the camera is just black.  Similar to how a computers webcam can't be used if being used else where, and you have to close whatever is using it to get it to work where you want it.   So closing the messenger app and restarting it fixes the problem.   Freshly opening the app, the camera will work, but if a save a photo or go use my stock camera app and go back to facebook messenger, it will be blacked out and I have to restart it.   Problem 2:Just started noticing that sometimes my phone won't detect rotation occasionally.  I keep my phone portrait locks so I only notice when using the camera, next time it happens I'll unlock rotation and see if it is phone wide or just the camera.  I believe this one is only resolved by restarting my phone, the problem is more new and I don't think jiggling the phone to make it detect the rotation has fixed it.I don't know how the sensor works, is it possible that my wireless charger is magnetizing the sensor and getting it to stick?  I believe that's just a wild incorrect visualization of mine of how it works because restarting the phone would then not be the solution.Sorry for the long post, just trying to give details.  Also, anyone else have the wireless charger because the charger port seems incredibly fragile? I'm all for a the bumpy transition to a new standard mini USB.Anyone else having similar happen?  How do I see which apps are using my camera?**Tldr:   1 &amp 2 at the top of post.**
SideSync isn't working on WiFi. I have a Lenovo Y510P laptop, and a TP-LINK WR740N router. I connected both the laptop and the phone to the network and turned SideSync on in both devices. Both are continuously scanning and not recognizing one another until I use an actual cable to connect them. I rebooted both and it still doesn't work.
An iPhone 6 users review of the Note 5 So I had an upgrade to burn on my jump plan before the period renewed so I figured I'd give android another shot with the Note 5 since it was the android phone that impressed me the most over the past year. Here are my impressions having switched from an iPhone 6 I had used for the past year. Also note that I've been on android MANY times before. I flip flop often so I'm not new here. First off I'll talk about the hardware. Being an iPhone user, I'm accustomed to the slick aluminum and glass build and I love it. I don't put cases on my phones because I appreciate a good build. I'm happy to say the note 5 doesn't disappoint by comparison to the iPhone. The aluminum trim feels great. The glass back, though not cool and crisp like the aluminum back on the iPhone still feels premium and feels gripper in my opinion. The white model I got doesn't show fingerprints which is certainly a plus. The phone is overall expertly built and I love holding it. This is a huge improvement over the last note I owned which was the Note 3  Software wise TouchWiz is light-years ahead of my last experience thankfully. It's no longer sluggish and jittery. I love the lollipop animations. It's a blast to use and far more exciting than ios. Sure the transition caused hiccups with imessage but that resolves itself in a couple days and it's not androids fault anyways. Little quirks I dislike primarily are some of the apps for email and podcast. The email apps are not as good imo as the stock apple app. Idk why so many developers don't include mark all as read as an option. The stock Samsung app, after some digging, does have the feature but it takes too many unnecessary steps. That's a nitpick thing I know but I use that a lot so it is annoying how many steps it takes. I also dislike that there is no stock podcast app and you have to dig through the app store for some 3rd party options. Player fm  I found after trying a few since it's the only one that competes with apples stock app. Another nitpick I know but basic functions like this I feel should be apps that are slick and available out of the box without having to go through trial and error. On the whole android has finally gotten to a point with its ui  that it can keep up with ios. No more jank and jitter. Steady framerate. It's just fun to use. Ios on the other hand is plain boring to use. It gets the job done. Edit: One big quirk I hate also is the inaccuracy of the fingerprint sensor. Idk if my unit is defective but it has like no better than a 50% success rate. Almost always takes multiple tries. I have to hold the phone just right to get it to work on the first try. Battery life: This is my one big disappointment with the Note 5 and Android. I know that most of the blame is on Google with their optimization of android but part of it goes to Samsung with the smaller 3000mah battery. The Note 5 is able to last me through my average workday comfortably which is great for most people. But when you're like me who came from an iPhone 6 with its teeny little 1800mah battery which could last 10-15% longer it is upsetting. You expect a big phablet  to pack great battery life and it annoys me that this drains so quickly. If my iPhone was at 100% before I went to sleep, I would wake up the next morning and it still had 100%. I do the same with the Note 5 and it will have just over 80%. If the phone isn't doing anything it shouldn't be draining battery like this. Standby needs to be improved on android. They need to find a way to be at least nearly as efficient as ios. In summation, battery life is perfectly fine and satisfactory, but when compared to iPhones  with tiny batteries, it is annoying that this can't touch them. The quick charger is also a big help in case you need a quick refuel after work for a night out. It really does make a difference and it isn't a gimmick. I really liked this feature and it did alleviate my anger at the relatively poor battery life.  Camera I can't comment on because I'm not a photo taker so Idk what's good and bad. Every review says it's the best so let's just trust them lol. If you ask me if I would go back to the iPhone I'd say probably yeah because of the battery life, and all my friends are on imessage but it's such a narrow reason to go back. The Note 5 is a fantastic phone that I enjoy and if I didn't have T-mobile jump, I totally would be fine being stuck with this phone for another year.Anyways there it is. Hope you enjoyed.
Annoying pop up ads... Anyone else getting these?  I've had my AT&ampT Note 5 for about 1days, and these very annoying pop up ads started about a week ago.  Ads for fanduel, HBO Go, bullshit shopping junk, etc.   I thought maybe they were coming from the facebook app, so I disabled it and the ads still pop up.  I even ran malwarebytes to see if my phone was infected but it found nothing...  any suggestions?  I never had this problem on my Note 3.
How do you hide apps? I want to hide some of the apps in my app drawer. How?
Does the Note 5 have the same 'camera focus' issue as the Note 4? I'm about to do a charge back on my Note 4 tomorrow if Samsung/ATT doesn't replace my Note 4.Since I bought my Note 4 it has had the camera focus problem. I drove to the repair center (2 hour drive up, 2 hour drive back) and they told me they didn't have the part. Fantastic! So then, I sent it in via UPS or whatever and the damn tech just did a software upgrade and sent it back. Same fucking issue..ATT will only offer me a refurb which I will not take since I bought it off contract for $900, and Samsung wants me to mail it in again but I told them I would not do that again. I'm pretty salty at this point.I really like the phone but the camera thing is unacceptable. I already had all my apps and all the bloatware removed etc. PINAAnyways, enough with the rant..Trying to find out if the Note 5 has the same issue?https://www.google.com/search?q=note+4+camera+focusing+problem&ampie=utf-8&ampoe=utf-8^ In case you don't know what I'm talking about.
Galaxy Note 5, S-Pen smells like burnt plastic Recently, I picked up a strong smell from my S-pen. It smells like burnt plastic. Is this normal? does your s-pen have a strong smell too?
Day one with Note 5, worried about heat Just got my Note 5 delivered today, and during initial setup it got quite hot. I know that phones get warm while setting up and downloading a ton of apps and settings, but it worried me, and in general this CPU runs hotter than I'm used to seeing. Upper 50s celcius usually, not charging, not in setup, just normal. Granted I'm still on day one. I returned my Nexus 6 because it got uncomfortably hot and signed on to AT&ampT's Next plan/indentured servitude so I could get this. Heat was my big problem with the Nexus, and it'd really be aggravating for it to be a problem with this too. Anyone else having any issues? Am I nuts? I'm willing to believe I'm nuts. Thanks, all.
Bluetooth range issues - Range is less than a few feet when wifi is turned on Hi all. This post is my last hope that someone has had these same problems and has come up with a solution. After two months of flawless use with my phone, it developed an issue with the range of bluetooth. I started noticing that my smart watch would disconnect on the walk to the watercooler where before I wasn't having this problem. After some experimenting, I discovered that the range of bluetooth was around 1-2 feet when wifi was turned on. Turned off, the range improved to a meager 7 feet or so. To reiterate, range was 20+ feet before with no quality loss or stuttering. I had the phone replaced under warranty and it worked fine for several days before the issue popped up again. I've gone through support with Samsung and AT&ampT and even demonstrated the problem at an AT&ampT warranty center, pairing with no problem to the floor model Note 5 and and walking across the store with no connection issues.I love every other thing about the phone, but this is extremely annoying. I'm using a lot more data by keeping wifi turned off for so much of the day and I generally feel bad that this expensive device isn't working right.Has anyone had this issue? Any solutions?

Samsung Pay won't open I opened Samsung Pay this morning to install it, which it did. But now when I try to open Samsung Pay, [this](http://gfycat.com/HelplessHardtofindChupacabra) is what happens.I'm on T-Mobile and I'm rooted (Knox is tripped) so could that be the reason this is happening? I know Samsung Pay isn't supposed to work if Knox is tripped I just thought it would be an error that would show up after opening the app.
Stalling issue I've had a note 5 for the better part of 2 weeks now it's a great phone but I get intermittent stalling of apps and downloads.This only happens while connected to WiFi.  LTE works great. The weird thing is that once the app starts you get great download speeds. You just have to sit through the spinning wheel for 3seconds beforehand. Every device in the house (in addition to an old note 3) has no problem connecting to WiFi with no delay. I've tried a hard reset,  factory reset and clearing the cache and nothing works. Has any one else found this problem? I ran a search in reddit and one user fixed it with toggling off Enhanced 4G LTE services but that isn't an option in my settingsI'm in Canada on Rogers and on 5.1.1.
Android Authority does a giveaway of the Note5 international version! 3 Days left! 
So i dropped my phone today... And it cracked the LCD but not the glass. ehhhh this sucks i dont have any insurance on it and its a JOD phone... holy crap! what to do? i can repair it myself. just dont know where to buy the part
Accepted into Samsung pay beta but how do I update app? I got accepted in to the beta yesterday morning but every time I open up the pay app, I get the same coming soon page. I have the latest tmo update installed and unrooted, does any one know how to update the Samsung pay app so I can start using it?  Thanks.
Music squares gone? On my S4, the Samsung music player had something called Music Squares which would pull songs from your music library based on criteria you could select from a grid, like relaxing to energetic. I can't find this on the Note 5. Has anyone found it or an alternative?
Lost my s-pen today :( It just fell out and I didn't notice. Pretty sure my dog hid it. This isn't the first time the pen has just slipped out. Pretty big design flaw if you ask me.
Anybody have trouble with in call muting? I frequently use my phone to join conference calls at work, and I've noticed a troubling trend of the mute button not always muting my microphone. It seems to always mute initially, but after some time, it seems to silently unmute itself (the indicator still shows being muted, but people comment that they can hear me). I haven't been able to find any specific common event that occurs when this happens, but I'm just wondering if anybody else has experienced something similar? I can't find much online about this...
Will an unlocked, internation version of the Note 5 work with T-Mobile? (I apologize in advance. I am not quite as tech savvy as many of you.)I am absolutely in love with the gold version of this phone, but I understand that it is not being offered by US carriers. I see that Amazon is selling a Factory Unlocked, International Note 5 in gold. Do any of you know if this would be compatible with my T-mobile SIM card/service? I've never dealt with factory unlocked phones and can't seem to find a definitive answer elsewhere on the topic. 
When is the 64GB Note 5 coming out in Canada? 
Keyboard cover popup Is anyone else having this issue: when I'm watching a video on YouTube, and I turn the phone to landscape, a message pops up saying that themes don't work with the keyboard cover (which I don't have, obviously) - and it deletes my material theme and turns me back to the stock theme. It also cancels my video. What the hell? 
Battery life - first three days 
Oh these bastards - rumor of Note 5 Active with bigger battery coming out in November http://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-5-active-rumored-for-november/&gt The tougher Galaxy Note 5 Active would allegedly equipped with a waterproof rating and larger battery (4,100mAh over 3,000mAh), according to tech site Phone Arena, which also suggested that the 5.7-inch jumbo phone would arrive in early November, in time for the bustling holiday shopping season.http://www.phonearena.com/news/That-4100-mAh-Note5-battery-It-may-be-in-a-Note5-Active-coming-in-November_id72890

Best Note 5 To Use In Europe ? Hey guys im looking to get a note 5 ,but living in Portugal its not available here.Here are my questions:What model should i get ,for it to work with lte bands 3,7 and 2,and come unlocked?Where should i get it ?P.s If i get it from ebay ,what should i look out for?Fake note 5?
Default applications - Use always / Just once options I can't find these options anymore. Am only presented with the available apps to open the app and the selected one becomes the default afterwards. I need to clear defaults if I want to open different apps later. Is this the case with you guys on the note 5?
Samsung Galaxy Note 5 S pen fix for stuck S pen 
SideSync Won't Install on Win 1I downloaded the SideSync software from the Samsung site, and must've gone through the installation 1times now, multiple reboots and attempted troubleshooting with no luck. I'm able to open the installer which prompts for administrative rights, i click Yes, and then it lets me get to the destination choice, and as soon as I click Install the installer disappears and nothing happens. Has anyone had this issue or know what's causing it? Driving me nuts. Is this a Windows 1not being supported yet thing?**Solved (for me)** Thank you PDXMatthew - https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxynote5/comments/3ip2rd/sidesync_wont_install_on_win_10/cuik4u2
What is the metal key in Verizon Note 5 box? This is my first android device and after opening the box ( for Verizon ) I noticed the replacement tips for the S-pen and there was a little key under the phone. Also in the picture instructions it shows there is a spot for a SIM card. I thought Verizon kept their SIM cards inaccessible? 
Did you go with the 64 GB or 32 GB? How is your experience? I've had the 64gb for the past week or so, but I'm wondering now if I should downgrade. It would mean getting back $12(plus Samsung is also doing a promotion for the next two weeks for new phones activated after the 25th They're paying up to $12of your first 3 months fees)32 is definitely small, so you have to consume storage consciously, but it can be done. What has your experience been?  The good thing is you can always get a small micro usb flash drive for movies on long trips thanks to USB on the go.
Can unrooting phone hurt battery life after changing it back to stock? My battery on my note 5 (tmobile) has been crappy lately after unrooting it to stock.Before rooting my note 5 I had my phone charged at 100% it would a drop a percent or two when hardly using it but recently after unrooting it the battery falls to 96 percent after 4minutes or so. Battery usage estimating says 11 hours :( . Before the battery estimating used to say 28 hours before i rooted it.I have already did a factory reset and wipe cache parition after unrooting it but nothing works. Also turned off the VOLte and wi fi calling and disabled some bloatware with package disabler
Touch Screen problem Hey guys,So I got the Galaxy Note 5 a fortnight ago and over the last few days the touchscreen has been playing up - sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't or drops out while I'm using the phone.  The S pen works fine every time but it's obviously a little annoying having to use that most of the time to browse on my phone.Does anybody have any suggestions as to what I can do to fix it?  I reset the phone and sometimes that works, sometimes it doesn't.  I would consider doing a factory reset but, never having done that before, I'm worried I'll lost all my contacts (apps and photos are fine, I can put them on again without my trouble).  If you guys could give me any sort of advice as to some things to try that would be greatly appreciated.
Plastic film on Flash? [deleted]
Are different Note 5 variant different in terms of hardware as well? Hi. * Thinking of buying the N5. * Since I travel, was recommended to get the F variant. * Since the F is way more expensive, I was wondering if I can purchase a used one from a carrier, and flash it - remove crapware, remove lock, and use as if it's the F. * Is this possible, or these are different on the hardware-level? Thanks! 
Delayed notifications on wifi Anyone having delayed notifications when they're connected to wifi? 
Thinking of buying a Note 5 - a few questions for you, if you don't mind... I'm torn between the Note 5 and the Nexus 6P. I've enjoyed my series of Nexi and have a bit of brand loyalty, and in particular have never had much affection for vendors' themes and UI tweaks. On the flip side, I'm curious about the Note 5's one-handed features and stylus input. With that in mind, a few questions:1: If I change the launcher to Google Now, or even Nova or something else, what if any functionality do I lose? I think I've heard Air Command is launcher-independent. Does Instant Memo still work? Fingerprint unlock? One-handed mode? Using the stylus to quickly grab a screenshot (see question below)? 2: I've read TouchWiz is more mature now, not so much an eyesore of resource hog. Anyone made the conversion from pure Android to this iteration of TouchWiz and been content with it? Or are there just some really great theme packs out there that can give me my old Googley look and feel?3: I rely heavily on OneNote in my work life and am curious about this as a companion platform when not toting my main work machine. Instant Memo only shoots into S Note, right? I'm guessing if I really needed to pull something out of S Note (e.g. an Instant Memo item), could I use the stylus to get a screenshot and just paste it into OneNote on the phone as a JPEG/PNG -- maybe? Right?Thanks for your time and input.
Can you have the Album Cover on the Lock Screen? On my old Galaxy Note 3, when I play my music, the Album Cover is set as the background on the lock screen. Did Samsung remove this feature in the Note 5? 
Is the Samsung Pay Promotion (Wireless Charger or Wallet Case) Over? Also I read earlier in the month many Verizon customers were having trouble taking advantage of the promotion.  Any VZW custos end up getting this to work?
Anyone had issues with SideSync losing communication when the GN5 goes to a lock screen? I've been test-driving the Note 5 and generally enjoying it, however notice that SideSync periodically loses communication when there is no activity on the phone's screen (and it thusly goes to a lock screen.)Anyone else had this issue and mitigated it?
Issues with the S Pen not writing on half of the screen. Help please! Just bought the Note 5 a few days ago and immediately noticed that the pen occasionally didn't work on the right side of the screen. I thought maybe finger prints were the issue. I finally sat down and tinkered with it for a few hours and realized that I cannot write in the semi circle were air command pops up, even if air command is closed. This seems to be a software bug and not an issue with the S Pen itself.Furthermore, if I hover the pen to get a little dot on the screen where I am about to write, it will not show up in the semi circle on the right side of the screen. It is as if the writing feature does not work in that portion of the screen. It cannot be a coincidence it is the air command portion of the screen is the area that I cannot write on. I have tried disabling air command but that does not work.Is this a known bug? It is hard to find help on this issue because the phone is new to the market. If anybody has had a similar issue please let me know and if a solution was found, any help would be greatly appreciated.  
After last nights update I have no WiFi or cell service [deleted]
Anyone else make their Note 5 back transparent? I have been on the fence about doing this ever since the post went viral. Just wondering if anyone else has done this and if they have been successful in doing so? Did you have to buy double sided tape to stick the glass back on or did enough of the adhesive stay on the phone to do so? Post pictures if you have done it as well too! 
S-Pen fell out, lost This was just a matter of time. You know how you insert the pen, and click it so it stays? Many times I have gone to use it, and noticed that it got bumped around in my pocket, backpack, whatever, and the pen was in there, but it was not clicked in anymore.So this morning I had my phone at my desk, got up to use the bathroom, about thirty yards away, and felt my pocket buzzing in the bathroom. Notification: Your S-Pen is Detached. Yeah, it was gone, and I retraced my steps and it's nowhere to be found. What's the process for getting a replacement S-Pen? Anbody know what they're charging? The phone is about two weeks old. Very frustrated by this.

Import calendar data from LGG2? Any chance this savvy bunch can tell me how to import my calendar data from my LGG2? The USB port on that sizzled and I only have 40% charge left before it's dead forever. I have a feeling it is not  possible without syncing it with Gmail or some other  service (the Internet told me that,  but I refuse to give up!) Thanks in advance.
Can you help me find the perfect case for Galaxy Note 5? Hey there,I'm going to purchase the Galaxy Note 5 and am looking to find the perfect phone case to accompany it. My perfect case would be: 1. Real leather (Brown not black) 2. Clip magnetically, not via a leather strap (for a cleaner look) 3. Not cover the volume or power buttons so I can press them directly instead of through a layer of material 4. Be thinI found this perfect case here: http://www.mobilefun.co.uk/piel-frama-framaslim-samsung-galaxy-s6-edge-leather-case-tan-p53640.htmHowever Piel Frama only make that case for the Edge and Edge+I am looking for style and comfort.Can anyone find or does anyone know of a case that fits all or most of the criteria?

Decent Leather backed cases? I've been looking everywhere for one and can only find ones with a cover or leather textured. Has anyone seen any around? Just leather backed, metal sides. Something nice and plush.
Chrome tab and changing button First, is there a way to show tabs for Chrome only?Secondly, can I change the window button (left of home) to function as the menu button like it used to be? I found out that you can hold the back button but I still prefer the way it used to be. Ty
Is the Note 5 compatible with Qualcomm Quick charge 2.0? I know the Note 5 no longer uses qualcomm cpu's, and qualcomm only lists the note 4 and note edge as compatible quick charge devices. Does anyone know if they are still compatible with battery packs and chargers that are qualcomm quick charge certified?
Does the rear camera have plastic film on it that should be removed?

Samsung Note 5 review [deleted]
Voice wakeup issue? Hey everyone, Every time I try to use voice wake up by saying Hey galaxy it ends up crashing over and over save for a few select times actually working. I can't get it to work at all and I haven't been able to for about two months. I tried resetting it and clearing the cache a million times but nothing seems to work. Package Disabler is not messing with it at all, I already checked that. Any suggestions? I also have looked all over the Internet to no avail 
Note 5 not animating GIFS in Samsung Messages or Verizon Message+ [deleted]
My Contribution to the awesome pictures you can take with this phone. I am completely blown away what kind of pictures you can get from this phone with very little skill or effort.  I'm really loving it.[Here's the gallery of images in \(in Google drive\)](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B_tymSa7zRbcZ1AyNk9oYzljaG8&ampusp=sharing)
Which variant to buy? I'm on AT&ampT, but destroyed my Note 4, no insurance. I have 13 months left on my contract. It'd cost $50to get a Note 5 via early upgrade through AT&ampT, so I might as well buy something on Swappa or other source. Which variant should I get? **Edit:  Went into a research black hole. Now considering grabbing a fair condition rootable Note 4 on Swappa and using that for a year until the Note 6 comes out and my contract will be up.**
This is ridiculous. Anyone having battery problems? 
Anyone else having problems with getting their device to initiate fast charging? Lately everytime I go to charge my phone it's been taking me about a minute or so while messing around with the cable and power supply to finally get my phone to fast charge. Im constantly unplugging and plugging in the USB cable until it finally for some reason decides to fast charge. 
One handed keyboard won't return to full size. So messing around with some options I found out that pressing the home key 3 times rapidly will turn on a one handed mode for the phone. Doing it again will return it to full screen, along with the option presented on the screen. However my Samsung keyboard has stayed in one handed mode and I cannot get it to return to full size....I have gone to using a third party keyboard to get a full size keyboard back. Anyone else have this issue or perhaps fixed it?
Has any one gotten their $5credit from Samsung? I have yet to receive the  $5credit or the wireless charger. I know many have gotten the chargers, I signed up at the tail end. But I did sign up for the credit day one. Wondering if anyone has heard anything about the credit or if you signed up for the wireless charger, at the last week, if you received one.

S-Pen stuck in slot in the correct direction Hi everyone, as the title says, my S-pen is stuck in its slot even though i inserted it the correct way. I didn't drop my phone or do anything damaging that could explain this. The pen is sucken in a bit more than it normally is, but otherwise i don't see anything noticeably different. I can press the pen in a good amount but there's no click sound and it won't eject. It just goes back to a depth slightly lower than normal. Any help would be greatly appreciated, and if i cant' fix it myself I suppose i'll just have to go into my carrier's store. Thanks in advance.
Phone won't turn off on charger When my phone is on charger and I get a notification my phone never goes back to sleep. What's going on 
These battery stats seem bad. What can I do? http://s2.postimg.org/nns2lz909/Screenshot_2015_08_22_18_56_10.pngMy phone was fully charged for the first time last night (phone off).  I unplugged it and turned it on.  I've got auto brightness set.  Wifi, data and sync on and that's it.  Most bloatware disabled.  I've got lots of other bells and whistles off too.  All I've done so far is browse the net and check some settings.  So far the battery seems horrible for me.  Any ideas? 
Phone Network Issue I recently got a WD MyCloud NAS and am able to access it remotely from outside my network and internally through my TV and Xbox. However, my Note5 cannot pick it up. I realized I was unable to ping the phone from my laptop and vice versa. However, I'm starting to realize it is the phone. I can run a network scanner from my computer and it detects the IP of my phone, but the phone does not see the computer. The phone cannot even ping itself! Anyone have any ideas?Phone: 192.168.1.4Computer: 192.168.1.7
So I've been using Samsung Pay lately, but the transactions don't show up, any idea why? 
New Note 5 Owner! Any Tips? (Canada Note 5 (N920W8) In terms of improving battery performance, cool themes, apps that are very useful besides the obvious social media ones?Pretty stoked, got the Gold 32 GB version. My last phone was a Nexus 5, so I think almost everything is an improvement. 
Google Play Music Output Does anyone use Google Play Music and notice that the volume is really low when you play out the speaker?I also use SoundCloud and music from there is way louder than from Google Play Music.
Does the write with screen off feature work with PIN lock? You can pull out the pen on the Note 5 with the display off and write on the screen. I love this feature. My question is, does it still work if you have a lock screen PIN, or does having a PIN disable it and force you to enter the PIN when you pull the pen out?

Camera Black in third party apps My camera works fine with the original camera app, but if I use anything else like instagram, FV-5, or any other third party app, the camera will appear black. Is this a common problem with the note 5? edit: got instagram to work with an update but fv-5 and Cinema4k (the app) still wont work.
Canadian Note 5 Colors Is it me or is that all of the Canadian carriers only carry Black Sapphire? I'm interested in the Pearl White color but there isn't an option to purchase that color. Anyone know if Pearl White is coming any time soon or is it only limited to Black Sapphire for now?
Does the Note 5 still have the Sidebar? Coming from the Note 4, and I can't figure out if there's still the sidebar or not? The one that gives you quick access to multiwindow where you drag apps out from the side.  Is there an option I'm missing to activate it, or is it simply not in this version of TouchWiz?
Stock messaging app sudden lag/slow? Anyone else get lag or slowness from the stock messaging app randomly?  I just had it happen.  I cleared the cache to see if that would do anything, but it didn't do much.  Seems like the lag/slowness just went away on it's own.  *Edit* It appears that Power Saving is causing it.  Once power saving is off messages are back to normal.  With Power Saving on...it slows the app down.
Those of you who were lucky enough to get the titanium silver, let's see it! I'm in the US so my only chance of buying one is to import. I'd like to see some photos of these in real life. How do you like it? Do you find it to be too reflective? 
Press power button, lock screen comes up. But it only stays on for 1-2 seconds. Has something changed? I feel like the lock screen would remain on for 5-1seconds in the past... because it's extremely noticeable how fast it turns off now.I have all power saving options off.  How can I extend the time that the lock screen stays on?  I use my phone often at night or early in the morning in the dark as a brief light... but having to tap the power button every couple seconds is immensely irritating.
S Pen So my friend had to try to put the S pen backwards, I was near a Samsung shop and i got it fixed in no time since i didn't try to pull it out. However i got home &amp i noticed that screen off memo and sound/vibration aren't working , the air command menu only pops up when i press the button. I don't know if they got it out the wrong way or what! Would a fresh software help ? Any ideas ?Thank you in advance,

How do I change the lock screen picture? I just got a Note  5 from Verizon.  I can't figure out how to change the lock screen from the stock Samsung pic.  There isn't an option in the settings menu, only to change the lock screen pin, but nothing for the picture.  Also tried to select a picture from gallery, but it only gives option to save as screensaver.  (The stock pic remains as the screen lock even when having changed the wallpaper).  Note 5 Redditors, please help!!!
Recommendations for a good glass screen protector? When I bought my note a few months ago I bought it with the Zagg glass protector and hated it. I didn't like the fact that it had the halo effect on the side and it didn't cover all the way around the home button or camera holes. Does anyone know of a good one that they are using? I'm afraid to buy one from amazon because alot of the reviews seem fake. Also none of the say anything about prevent that halo effect.Also I'm probably going to get a case or a bumper with it, so if you're using a glass screen protector and case let me know if it is working out for you.

Do alarms drain the battery? This is something I've wondered about every phone. Does always having scheduled alarms turned on significantly drain the battery? For example having one on that goes off MWF and another that goes off T/Th.
I'm successfully using Samsung Pay Beta in the US and loving it! Talk about Samsung putting Apple to shame! Samsung Pay rules! Being able to use it in any mag stripe reader is brilliant and it's something I'm enjoying quite a bit. Once you get it app set up, the app can be opened by simply swiping up from the bottom of the screen, even on the lock screen. The you just use your fingerprint and tap to pay.Anyone else using the beta? 
Where to get the gold Note 5 from AT&ampT? Been looking to upgrade to Note 5 but specifically want it in gold color with 64GB storage. I've tried major retailers like Amazon, and even phoned Best Buy and neither of them has it. And yet I've seen many ads of Note 5 in gold color. One option I have is the unlocked version but I don't have much cash to shell out at once so upgrading with AT&ampT is ideal. Do you know of any retailer that carry it? (AT&ampT carrier)
Defective Unit? So I have the sprint model of the note 5 and have noticed a couple weird things. Here are what I believe are the most important. 1. Can't go more than half a day on full charge with moderate use. Just having the screen on with auto-brightness for a minute or two will drop down 1%. 2. When charging, both the phone and charger get very hot to the touch. (Using samsung provided charger)3. When trying to call, occasionally the dialer will stop after about half a second of dialing and I will have to restart the phone to be able to make a call.4. I get lots of error messages saying phone must restart or signal errors (error 34 is most common one)Are these things normal?
Need assistance with Note5. Texts dont appear on lock screen. So i had a note5 i got last month and when i got a text i could see it on the black lock screen and reply if i wanted without unlocking the phone.  But this phones screen had issues so they replaced it for me for free.  The new phone does not show texts like that when i get them.  I have looked around, enabled the lock screen notifications for Message+ and still nothing.  I did install that nova launcher, but im not sure if that caused the problem.  im about 90% certain that the issue was there for the day before i installed nova launcher.  Can anyone confirm if they have nova launcher and still get lock screen texts?  or maybe someone knows what my problem is.Any help would be great.  Its not horrible or user breaking, just inconviant to have to open up message+ to reply.
YouTube fullscreen I like to use my phone in portrait lock so I don't accidentally press something when the phone is only slightly rotated. Anyways, I guess the YouTube app updated or something but I didn't see. I was using the app just fine, pressing the full screen arrows fills up and auto rotates the screen like its supposed to. Suddenly one video when full screened, instead, centers the video and fills the rest of the screen with black. Is this the case for anyone else or am I the only one that's peeved by this? 
Note 5 Bad Battery Life I am getting very bad battery life on the Verizon Note 5. Android System is using most of my battery and then it is cell standby. I am currently at 53% with only 1 hour of on screen time. What can I do to fix this?
Current, future and potential Note 5 owners, I have three questions for you. Hey all,I'm quite possibly going to purchase the Note 5 and have three questions I want to ask the fans directly:1. What's the situation with unlocked bootloaders/rooting/rom'ing? At the very least I'd love to be able to root my device and load a TWRP or similar.2. Has anyone tried xposed? If not is there an indication of the progress of support for the phone?3. What don't you like about the phone? I am really interested in purchasing the device but I'll have to take it on contract and would like to know what I'm getting myself into! Thanks for the help in advance. 
Convince me to buy a Note 5 Im really interested in the phone but my main issues are the size may be too big and the battery life, other than that I love everything i've read about this phone, so please convince me that its worth a buy
No Silver Titanium on Verizon? Is that color carrier specific?  Thanks.
Charging issues Using an unlocked verizon note 5 on t-mobile, every time I plug the USB charging cable in to charge the phone it makes the notification sound that it is  connected, and immediately after the phone makes a disconnect sound and stops charging.  The phone does it nonstop back to back. Sometimes the phone freezes up it does this so bad.Also getting a notification that the phone is connected to a dock but I don't use a dock. And I don't have one. Also getting notification about power sharing when ever I plug the phone in. Anyone had anything like this happen to them?Samsung had me put the phone I need safe mode and clear some cache, but the phone has the same issues, if not worse now. Used different USB cables, wall plugs, and wall outlets. Waiting on Samsung to call me back.
After screen has been off for 5+ minutes pressing home/power buttons doesn't turn the screen on... I did a factory reset so I know it isn't me as it happened before I even had more than 2 apps installed.I don't understand if this is my phone or specific batch of them or what...All T-Mobile is allowing me to do is spend $2to do an exchange on the phone but I don't think this small issue is worth it.Anyone else having this issue? Has anyone had this happen on any of their other phones?
Switching to Note 5, looking for tips and advices Hello everyone!    I'm looking to buy the note 5 soon and just have a few questions before I fully make the switch (coming from a note 2 user):  1. How do you change (prolong) the battery? I'm looking to using the phone for at least a year or so, since I'm quite a heavy user, I tend to do a minimum of 1 charge a day. I might need to change the battery along the way, but how do you do it? Or am I shit out of luck and need a total phone replacement?    2. For people who have used up most of the space on their phones, does the system significantly slow down?  3. How game changing is the phone compared to note 5? Leaving the removable battery and sd card, how much more better is the note 5 in terms of its specs and features?    Thanks for the help everyone!
Netflix promo code update I just got my code today in my email, so it didn't take too long except I had to call pretty high up into prize logic to get my stuff complete so a manager might have pushed it through faster. They probably got tired of the 5 voice-mail a day for two weeks lol
Galaxy note 5 screen protector. Coming from iPhone 6 Plus...I Just bought a galaxy note 5 and I love it. But the thing is...should I put a screen protector or tempered glass for it? Because I generally don't like to put  screen protector for my phone. Is the glass screen on the front durable ?Edit: And I'm also scared that since using s-pen..the screen will be prone to more scratches. 
Fingerprint and backup pin? Is it possible to lock the phone with your fingerprint and also show a pin unlock as backup? It asks for a password as backup method now...
Crazy battery drain overnight! Anyone else have issues? Hey all, I just got my Note 5 4 days ago. Everything has been fantastic so far. Came from the One Plus One and went back to Samsung. Last night I went to bed with a 26% battery, thinking I'll just charge it when I go to work as I hate leaving it plugged in all night. Woke up late because my alarm didn't go off, only to find my phone was dead!I'm baffled as to how it drained 26% in 6.5hrs. As soon as I got my phone, I disabled all useless bloatware from my service provider and maximized my settings to ensure battery life. For 3 days its been great. I did notice my Cell Standby usage was unusually high yesterday, about 19% battery drain which I thought was odd....Anyone else having this issue? Possible fixes? Thanks guys and gals!
Don't have None as an option for the lock screen? Trying to use a different lock screen so I need to disable the lock screen to not have a double lock screen. Is there a fix? 
Is there a battery case that doesn't add a significant chin? I thought I saw one on Kickstarter some time ago. Not sure what it's called, or if it works with the Note 5. And that one adds an memory card slot as well. Or are there any other battery cases out there sans the chin? 
Suggestion of cool and awesome launcher for my note 5? Any suggestions? Im still with my basic theme and launcher. Want to change it into another cool and awesome launcher or nice theme?
Samsung Pay 2nd review (after using it for a few days now) Summary: The technology works fine, but the humans involved can be a little difficult.I've not encountered a single magnetic card reader that failed to work with my Note 5 (obvious exceptions are ATMs, gas pumps, or any similar machine where you need to physically insert the card). What I have encountered several times is employees who think I'm an idiot for holding my phone on the side of the card reader instead of over the NFC pad. They try to babytalk me through it and some have even put their hand on my phone to try to help me (I don't like that).Worse is when THEY need to select the payment method on their side of the terminal and they see me with my phone out so they just choose the NFC option and so I can't test the magnetic strip method. Well, I guess I shouldn't care about this becuase NFC works too. but I want to be using the cool new thing, so I get annoyed.ALSO, one weird hiccup was when I bought something at the Disney store, I gave in to the clerk because she was being particularly babying towards me ... but when I used the NFC method they asked me for the CRC on the back of the card. I remember inputting that number into Samsung Pay, but I couldn't find it anywhere in the app/interface when asked for it and I was later quite annoyed that it asked for it at all. There is no card, it's NFC, Samsung Pay is supposed to generate virtual card numbers, I don't even know if the CRC on the back of my physical card would match up with the virtual one Samsung Pay generated. On top of it, I can't help but think the whole thing would have gone effortlessly if I was allowed to use MST instead of NFC... tempted to try again soon.Also, one girl at Subway was particularly perky and excited about seeing me use Samsung Pay, she thought it was the coolest thing ever.
Flash Cover Plastic and Scratch Removal Random question for Note5 owners. I recently noticed that the plastic cover that protects the flash and heart rate sensor is scratched (and, yes, I removed the little piece of plastic that was on the cover when I got the phone). I'd like to attempt to remove these annoying scratches, so do any of you have any recommendations how to go about this? Any household products I can use? I tried using a dab of toothpaste but that didn't work. 
Instead of receiving messages in group text I'll get this at times and switch to Textra to view the text. Anyone else? 
I Shopped With Samsung Pay All Over NYC But It Couldn't Kill My Credit Card 
Extremely slow loading photos/videos inside of apps. So I've had the note5 since release and have noticed that photos and videos in apps load incredibly slow. When I open a gfycat in reddit sync it can take several minutes to load. YouTube inside of reddit sync takes a minute or so to start playing the video. Pictures of apps inside Google play store app take 3seconds or so to appear. Posts on Facebook take about a minute or two to load.  Does anyone know of any known issues causing this with the note5? I came from a GS4 and never had an issue like this. Is my phone defective? 
Getting a Note 5 and thinking about getting a dbrand skin If I get a screen protector, would I put the skins on top of the glass or is it not worth it to get a dbrand skin for the front of the phone.edit: Love the person who's down voting all the comments :)
Disabling the close all button in the app switcher? Is there a way either through a skin or customization without rooting of getting rid of the stupid close all button in the touchwiz app switcher? Otherwise love this phone, but this is so annoying when I hit it by mistake and lose all my current opened apps statuses (including browser tabs)..
Unlock then fingerprint? From turning my phone on it requires me to swipe up then do the fingerprint.   Is there a way to turn off the swipe portion?

Need your opinion/help on my stats. Could you guys tell me if my stats are normal or not? I'm worried about Google services being my second highest battery drainer yet my SOT isn't that bad. I have auto brightness on by the way. I see several people showing their stats and Google services is never on top of the list. I'm wondering if I could get even better battery life if I could find a fix for this. Thanks!http://imgur.com/a/MlNl5

So I cracked my screen... Where do you guys recommend going to get it replaced? I know that when I had an iPhone that I would just take it to an apple store but what would I do with my note 5? Thanks! 
Turning on/off location sets new alarm... When I use Google Now to set my morning alarm (specifically using the Ok Google voice command), and then I turn location services on/off, it will set another alarm for the same time. So every time you push the location button in quick settings, it will set a new alarm (whether you turn it on or off doesnt matter. It sets a new one for both). I got it to set 5+ alarms and I can replicate it 100% of the time (only using the voice command with Google Now, not typing it in on the clock app). What a weird glitch lol. Can anyone replicate it?

Wrap/Case that adds grip but doesn't take away from the beauty of the phone? So we all know the Galaxy Note 5 is not only one of the most beautiful phones but also one of the slipperiest phones of all time. I want to keep the esthetics of the phone as much as possible but I also don't want to worry about it slipping out of my hand all the time. I purchased a dbrand skin (black carbon) in hopes that it would provide some grippyness but unfortunately it is just as slippery if not worse. What is the most minimalistic option I can add to my phone to keep the looks but add some grip?   Are any of the slickwraps skins any more grippy? (bamboo cork or leather) or will I have to go with a clear case? I'm sure I'm not the only one that was wanting this so please let us know what your solution was and how happy you are with it. Thanks so much in advance!

For users required to have a PIN For people with work-provided phones: does the fingerprint reader qualify instead of pin as a secure lock?My work-provided Note 3 is required to have a PIN lock. I assume the fingerprint reader would be allowed in place of it, but want to check. I realize it may vary by employer, but just wanted to get a sense of people's experiences.
One handed operation The Note 4 had a couple one handed operations features. Like minimizing the screen, does anyone know if the 5 has this feature?

S Pen issues turning me off from buying a Note 5, but I still want one. Should I still go for it? I've been lurking around this subreddit because I have plans on getting a new phone in a couple of weeks or so. I'm honestly torn between an S6 and a Note 5, and currently using an S4. I want an S Pen because I love to doodle (yup, I doodle on my S4 and it's kinda hard lol) and the added functionality. But I've read a lot about the Note 5's S Pen here, like getting stuck even if inserted the right way, but I'm actually scared of the reverse insertion because I sometimes space out, the clicking mechanism getting broken, suddenly losing the S Pen, etc etc. I know replacements are available but I live in a country where shipping is a mess (lost items, high customs tax) and sometimes getting accessories from Samsung stores is a pain in the bum (had to buy a charger cable from a different store because the Samsung store doesn't have them). Obviously I may overuse the S Pen because of the doodling habits and I may encounter any of the common problems I read here really soon. So should I still go for the Note 5 or let the S Pen go? Thanks a lot for your input :)
Samsung Pay randomly appearing? I have Simple Pay turned off for now because the only card I have currently has no funds, waiting on all that. Anyways, in the meantime it seems the last few days since I activated it, it just shows up on my lock screen or home screen out of nowhere. Tried turning all simple pay things on and off again but nothing seems to have fixed it yet. Minor annoyance. 
DBrand Leather skin problems! Has anyone else purchased a DBrand leather (or any other) skin and had any issues with the cuts? I just received mine today and the cut across the bottom of the skin is AWFUL. No where near a straight line. I have been waiting for this skin for a week so I don't have to risk running a completely naked phone so I went ahead and installed it. It does not fit at all. The bottom edge is so jagged that the glass is clearly visible under almost the entire bottom edge of the skin. It also falls a little short on the top corner as well. I have sent an email to DBrand explaining the situation to see what they are willing to do for me. Just wondering if anyone else had run into this issue??(link to a couple of pics of the skin)http://imgur.com/a/rtI5D
Battery life: My first full day with the Note 5 
case vs tempered glass screen protector are you guys putting your phone in a case and a screen protector? Or just one or none at all? I really dont want to use a case and would rather just buy  a glass screen protector.
When opening am intent in an app and it asks what app to default to is there a way to select just once? I do not always want to use the same app for certain things. I come from nexus devices and have not owned a Samsung since the note 2.
Can I flash a custom recovery? Hey guys. I recently switched from an iPhone to Android, so bear with me. I'm aware that AT&ampT is attempting to prevent users from rooting the note 5, so is it possible to install a custom recovery? And without tripping KNOX? Thanks
Interact with lockscreen quick settings Is there a way to interact with the quick settings toggle without unlocking?

Anyone come from an S6/S6Edge? How does the Note 5 compare, beyond the obvious screen size, of course?Have they fixed the annoyances that plague the S6(E?)Things like:* Grinding OIS module on the camera (makes it seem like it'll fail sooner rather than later)* Shitastic RAM management * Disappointing battery life?* God-awful glare* Rage inducing palm detection (My palm is always accidentally hitting things on my Edge) - on that note (no pun intended), how is the palm detection, given the crazy small bezels?I'm upgrading today and am trying to decide between a Note 5, G4, or jumping ship to a 6S Plus.
Fast charging almost doesn't work I use only the charger that came with my Note 5, and when I plug it in it shows Cable  Charging and not Fast Charger Connected almost every time. And it is really really slow, especially compared to fast charging.Also, sometimes after multiple time of plugging and unplugging the cable (in both ends and also the wall brick) it does work. But not always, and after frustrating many times of in and out..Help someone? :)

Phone will not automatically connect to the radio in my 2015 Subaru WRX. **UPDATE** Pairing from the steering wheel (voice method) worked. Thanks for the help guys. I have an issue where bluetooth will not automatically connect in my car. Bluetooth automatically connects to my tablet, sound bar, minispeaker, headphones, you name it but my car is a no go. My Note 4 never once had this issue so it makes me think maybe it isnt the radio. Upon initial pairing (which happens a lot because I am always flashing roms) everything is fine. I get back into the vehicle and it will only connect if I manually initiate it via the bluetooth screen and turn the car radio off then on. Maybe takes two tries. The other weird thing is that it is only connected for media, I have to view the settings and toggle on phone call audio like 5-1times before it actually sticks (which also populates indicators for battery and cell strength on the car radio). Anyone else having issues like this? T-Mobile variant, rooted and ROM'd. Issue also existed when it was stock unrooted.

Question about album art Not really a question about the phone itself but I like this community so I'll ask here anyway. Why is it that when I'm listening to music on my phone(using the music widget), the album cover doesn't always show up? It's right there in every folder that contains all the tracks and the front cover jpeg but only a very small portion of them actually show up. Am I using the wrong file format? It seems like they're all the same...What am I doing wrong?[1](http://imgur.com/iAMiOhg)[2](http://imgur.com/oF7PDU9)

My T-Mobile Note 5 is screwed...bricked? I installed Marshmallow through Odin and used the .PIT file and kernel and recovery that was in the XDA tutorial.  I wanted to return the device to stock Lollipop but it doesn't seem to want to happen no matter what I try.  I have downloaded stock ROMs and loaded through Odin successfully but the phone boots to a blank wallpaper that just fades in and out.  It does nothing else.  Other stock ROMs I tried put the phone into a bootloop at the T-Mobile screen.  So I did a wipe of cache as recommended to break the bootloop and that didn't fix that either.  I need an expert here to help me out because I have a very expensive paperweight on my hands now. :(I appreciate any help in advance.EDIT: Thanks to /u/Unheard for the advice...Kies 3 worked!
Note 5 in Canada? From what I've seen from multiple carriers in Canada, only 32 gb model Blacl Sapphire is available. Excuse me? Can we at least get a 64 gb if there's no Micro SD slot and more colours? I mean Black Sapphire is great but I was really looking forward to Titanium Silver.
Can we please stop the anti note 5 circle jerk?! OK, so you're not happy about non-removable battery and no SD slot. Go read/watch some reviews on other phones and and hit up their sub-reddits. Some people are actually excited about the positive changes that have been made to the Note 5 and it would be nice to have a forum to discuss this device without the constant negative posts and down voting of any praise post. It's just a freaking phone people.
Smart lock question So have a pebble watch and I cannot get notifications unless I have the phone locked. Currently using the the fingerprint to unlock. So I have added my pebble watch as a trusted device as this then allows me to get notifications to it. But the kicker is when I need to access my phone I have to press home button, swipe a lock button then use my fingerprint to unlock it. So it's an extra step that is really annoying. Any way around this?
Slow messaging Is anyone experiencing lag or slowness when using the messaging app? I tried switching keyboards to see if it helps but for some reason at times it lags or gets extremely slow.

ATT - how to remove unwanted persistent notifications Ok, I am dumb and cannot figure out how to attach an image.

What's the difference between Note 5 HK version and the one available in Australia? Samsung won't release the Silver color for Note 5, in Australia. I can order one off t-dimension.com, but it says HK version. Would there be any difference between the two? Thanks guys. 
Any way to get Bluetooth media volume louder The audio for media is very low on my galaxy note 5 compared to ringtones or notifications. When paired to my bluetooth audio speaker my iphone is loud like it should be. I know that the Bluetooth speaker is able to push sounds loud enough but why can I not get the note 5 media to be as loud? I've made sure the volume is at max by clicking OK and then going past the orange line. It seems they're having issues with this in the past but I have not been able to find a fix for Android. Any ideas
Samsung Galaxy Note 5: New Leak From Sprint??s Website Reveals Full Specifications 
Quick Charging Woes I've had the device since September, and I've noticed that with time I've developed issues with the detection of quick charging. Sometimes it'll take up to 1times of unplugging and replugging my phone into the charger for Fast Charging to start. I've been using the same power brick and cable that came from the box, should I invest in a new cable? What should I do?Edit: I contacted Samsung via email and they said if I had a warranty with my retailer (Verizon), they should be able to replace it for me or I had the option to send it into Samsung themselves. Verizon changed out the charger with their own Fast Charging cable free of charge, and now it works flawlessly.

BestBuy One Unlimited plan question. Does unlimited data include wifi-hotspot? Did you do the BestBuy One Unlimited plan when you got your Note 5?  I did and I'm curious if the unlimited high speed data includes unlimited use of the wifi-hotspot.   Do you use your hotspot for Netflix or gaming?
Can anyone please tell me what this icon means? 
Upgrading to a Galaxy Note 5 I have the Verizon Galaxy S5. This would be my first Note. I'm not afraid of the size. I do have one key question. Every time I am using my Galaxy S5 my RAM hits upwards of 1.35GB and never lower. I know the Note 5 has 4GB of RAM. Will that substantially help me get rid of the lag and delay like for example it takes about 5 seconds for the fast app switching menu to come up, the keyboard to display, and others. I guess what I'm sying is the 4GB of RAM does that mean assuming I'm running the same apps I'll see 1.35GB used and close to 3GB free therefore making it a very fast phone or will I still see lag with even 3GB of RAM free. 
Poor 3d performance? Hoping mine isn't a dud, curious to have others weigh in here. First noticed this using Google Earth, moving around with 3d cities on feels very sluggish, surprised just how slow it is. In a big city? Forget about it, crawling practically.I did some benchmarks using 3dmark. Ice Storm Unlimited netted me a score of 23413, and Slingshot using ES 3.1 gave me a 1081, the latter giving me extremely low fps (4-7) throughout. At the end of the Slingshot benchmark it had a message along the lines of your device is powerful yet it's getting lower than expected performance.Guess I'm concerned I've got a lemon but wanted to check others' experiences using things like google earth, benchmark scores etc. Planning on using this for gearvr that comes out next month so obviously I need a device in tip top shape to power something that demanding. Any input appreciated!
Another rumor about Note 5, S pen is tactile and new feature named quicknote...quicknote sounds nice. 
My phone has been really laggy It started out as just the messaging app. The time between touching the keys and them showing up is getting really long. Now it has moved to the videos. The audio is not timed correctly anymore. Has anyone had this problem? How did you fix it?
Battery Life Suddenly Short and no Quick Charge http://i.imgur.com/D8Nf7ui.pngJust yesterday or the day before I noticed my phone wasn't quick charging except once using my car charger (after being plugged in for a while charging normally). And yes I've tried different cables. The one I'm currently using is not the one it came with and it was quick charging my phone but now it's not.Also my battery life seems noticeably shorter. I was getting around 2hours of battery life before and now it's predicting 13. I've checked for apps running in the background so I'm not sure what's going on here.
Official Power Bank with wireless charging capabilities? As shown down the page here: http://www.samsung.com/sec/galaxy/note5/accessories/Does anyone have any information on the specifics of this accessory? It sort of looks like it's a power bank that has wireless charging capabilites, but it also looks like it may even clip onto the phone (highly doubtful).

Anyone getting Message not found MMS message from anonymous users? I have noticed an increase in the number of MMS messages that are coming in as Message not found from an unknown user.  The message will appear in the message thread of specific people, so it's clear that it's coming from certain people, and these people will say they tried to send a picture, and it's just that I'm not getting it.

Network reception stops working Hey Everyone,I've had my Titanium Silver Note 5 for a week as of today and I absolutely love it. It's a fantastic upgrade over my old Note 2. That being said, I've found that a few times my network reception will just stop working. I'll turn on/off Airplane mode to try to kick start the phone to find a network, but it doesn't seem to work until I reboot my device. There is no notification on my device stating it has no network reception, but Spotify won't load songs, Snapchat will just hang there and I can't even use a Google search because it claims I'm offline. Has this occurred with anyone else? If so, is there a fix?
New Note 5 optimization suggestions I just got my note 5, I had the note 4 i decided with a 64gb i can live without the SD card and removable battery even though i am pro keeping those options. (i already miss my IR sensor)im looking for advice to really make my battery last as long as possible without restricting the processor heavily. (if anyone has detailed experience using regular power saving mode that would be nice) as of now im not using any battery saver options, and im not terribly unhappy with the battery, but it doesnt seem to be any better than my 4 at all.Ive already uninstalled as much bloatware i can find (anything i may not be thinking of would be appreciated) and my ram is between 1.3-1.4 free, is this normal? good?what setting do you guys use for display screen mode? im using amoled cinemaif anyone has any tips, settings, features they do or dont use to optimize the phoneand lastly, any cool apps to check out would be appreciated!!!!I use nova prime for my home launcher, and have some cool icon packs, really love customizing my phone, i like dashclock widget is nice, i also like month calender which has a ton of customization optionsI play a ton of RPG's, i have most of the Final Fantasy remakes and i used gameboid for a GBA emulator (i need a new snes emulator, snesdroid is not great)i use textra for texting and swiftkey for keyboard (cool to match up a keyboard and notification theme without making it look cheesy)Reddit is fun (is there a better app for reddit?)and anyone not using it, i strongly suggest signing up for google rewards, earn lots of free money with that
Wallet Case? I am looking for a wallet case for my Note 5 but I dont want one that has a tab closure (see [here](http://www.amazon.com/Abacus24-7-Wallet-Leather-Galaxy-Pockets/dp/B011IUHL9I).)  Any suggestions?
Mini messaging window (like one handed mode) I keep putting my messaging app into a small size that I can move around the screen.   Unsure how this is happening.   It's about the size of the one handed mode window and functions similarly.   Sending this from mobile. Does anyone know how I am doing this?  The window overlays the rest of my screen.  It's almost like a mix between one handed and split screen/multi-tasking.  Ty for help.
Note 5 Wi-Fi issues Hey guys. I'm loving my note 5 and it's great. One thing is really pissing me off. When I'm on the PC I have whatsapp web open all the time and with my note 3 when I leave my phone untouched on wifi it doesn't disconnect. With the N5 it keeps disconnecting. There's one group which is quite active and when I didn't get messages for about 1minutes straight I knew something was up. I press the home button on the N5 and in about 5 seconds all the messages load on the phone then whatsapp web pops it up.I turned off smart network switch and also when you dial in *#1101# or something and turn off that wifi saver. Not sure what else to do. Thanks guys.
Upgrade time, need advice note 5 vs s6 edge+ My employer is about to order my phone upgrade. I currently have a Note 2, which I have liked, but have had a few issues with. I like the edge, but note 100% sure which way to go.Some of the issues I have had with the Note 2:* While on calls, my face/ear push stuff on the screen all the time, turning off wi-fi, bringing up world clock, etc.* TouchWiz was a bit crappy on this version, although I have heard its better now (and I assume used on the edge anyways)* After about 2 years, my charging port gave out, forcing me to buy a battery charger and swap out batteries all the time.* I never really had much of a use for the stylus, I will on occasion pull it out, but really never have a major need for it.
What are the improvements on Note5's camera over the Note 4's?

Deals/discounts for note5? Does Reddit know of any other deals going on whether in store or online around the internet? Looking for Note 5 on T-mobile, preferrably 64gb version, but willing to settle for 32gb if a deal is decent enough.I'm aware of costco's cash card deal and best buys deal, but BB doesn't have tmobile phones apparently, and Costco seems to only work for 32gb, which none of the stores near me seem to have stock left. Hoping to find something similar or better before the deal expires, and hoping maybe theres something I havent found. As much as this phone costs, I want to at least feel like im getting some sort of deal out of the insane purchase price. :P
4g/3g/1g on and active while connected to WIFI. So I am having an issue with this. I know from reading it is normal for it to show the connection and be grayed out indicating its not being used but I am seeing them go white throughout the day. I feel like this could be causing some of my battery drain. Anybody know whats going on. I am worried because I also bought my son a Note 5 yesterday and need to make sure he isn't going over on data.
Battery Setting missing? The title basically says it all, my Battery option in my settings is missing and idk why. Could it be due to something I disabled?
Worth the upgrade at this point? I've had the Galaxy S5 since April 2014 and have loved it as my first Android after the switch from the iOrchard. Unfortunately I never treated the S5 with the care it needed and never got a case. Fast forward to at least one screen replacement and a current cracked, 2nd screen that is literally starting to peel off from the front of the phone. I know I'll miss the removable battery and SD card slot but I think I can manage better my photos with cloud storage. Now to my questions...seeing that currently I'd most likely get the 16GB through Costco since they have a great deal including $25Costco cash, how do you recommend managing apps and the space they take up? Additionally, would I be better off sticking with the Galaxy S6 Edge or is there actual benefit to the casual user in the Note version? I'm intrigued by the stylus but just don't know how many actual situations come up that it would be of use. What have yours been? Finally, any recommended cases that allow for easy pen use? I will 100000% be protecting my next phone like Fort Knox. Thanks all.
Group Messaging Stopped Working After Adding Contacts Hi, I recently encountered an issue with my Note 5 where I can only see one person's responses to group messages.I'm 100% sure that group messaging was working before. For example, I was in a group text with some project team members and everything was fine. After adding those team members to my contacts list the group message stopped working. Oh, and it appears that now all of my group texts are experiencing the issue.To clarify:-In a group message I only receive 1 person's texts. The other people's don't show up at all.-I believe that all of the group members can see the texts I send out.-This happened after adding some people from a group message to my contacts, however I does not necessarily mean that it is the cause of the issue.Any Ideas?

Atrocious connection strengths (on AT&ampT) So I had my Note 3 for a while now, loved it to death, it had some minor issues operating in my room but nothing major, AT&ampT doesn't really get great service by me, but it was always at least 2 bars of 4G and my wifi network, router one room over, always had at least 3 bars.  Fast forward to earlier this month: Given my love of my Note 3, I excitedly upgrade to the Note 5. Much to my dismay, not only do I find it's battery life very underwhelming, especially compared to the 3, but I also cannot place phone calls from my room anymore, not even standing near the window. Now I'm lucky if I even get 1 bar of 4G, or 1 bar of wifi strength. Is this something with the Note 5 in general? Is it just bad at signals? It's incredibly frustrating because the phone is gorgeous and I love it, but the lack of functioning connections on a phone kinda kills it for me.
Amazon Underground App? Hey everyone, I've been trying to install the Amazon underground app for about an hour now and I can't get the damn thing to work. I've tried allowing unknown sources, restarted my phone, tried different mirrors, etc. But all I get is a notification saying that all apps associated with this action have been turned off or blocked or whatever. Any solution you guys know of? I looked everywhere and couldn't find anything. 
Strange netflix issue - very slow UI/load This problem is driving me nuts, hoping someone has a solution or has experienced it. Basically loading any INFO in netflix is incredibly slow over Wi-Fi only. On first open the app takes ~1m to load the front page, if I need to load more info it's just as slow. If I switch to LTE it's normal. If I click on something to watch, it streams fine, goes HD very quick. Subtitles take a bit to appear. I usually figure stuff out on my own but I'm genuinely at a loss on what to do next.Here's what I've tried with effect:Google DNS(no change)Different router(no change)Tried other phones on same wifi(they work fine)Laptop on wifi(works fine)Browse netflix in chrome on my Note 5(works fine lol)Updated PhoneUninstalled/Reinstalled Netflix

Will my Note 5 work on Mobilicity? (Canadian Network) Hi there,As the title shows, will the *Samsung Note 5 \(SM-N920W8?\)* work on the Mobilicity wireless network?***Sadly, the device's model is not listed on willmyphonework.net, and so I resorted into looking at [preliminary specifications](http://pdadb.net/index.php?m=specs&ampid=8704&ampc=samsung_sm-n920w8_galaxy_note_5_lte-a_32gb_samsung_noble) and [bestbuy.ca](http://www.bestbuy.ca/en-CA/product/samsung-sasktel-samsung-galaxy-note-5-32gb-smartphone-black-2-year-agreement-sm-n920w8/10389073.aspx) for the bands:* **2G**: GSM 850/900/1800/1900* **3G**: UMTS 85(B5), 1700/210(B4), 190(B2), 210(B1)* **Other**: LTE 70(B12), 1700/210(B4), 180(B3), 190(B2), 230(B30), 260(B7)&gt Mobilicity's network uses AWS with bands 1700/210\([source](http://mobilicity.ca/support/faqs/most-popular-questions/i-have-a-phone-already-can-i-use-it-on-the-mobilicity-network-1/)\)  Is that the same as UMTS 1700/2100?&gt Wind Mobile also uses AWS 1700/210\([source](http://www.windmobile.ca/my-wind/faq/devices)\). They also sell the Note 5 to be used within their networkMobilicity uses an identical frequency. If WindMobile supports it, then Mobilicity should be able to support the phone as well, correct? ******TLDR:** Will a Samsung Note 5 work under the Mobilicity wireless network?*I wanted to know before I decide to purchase one to make sure that the phone would work. Also, Mobilicity does not sell the Note 5 themselves :(*
A question about Slow Mo on the Note 5. Hello everyone, I am currently in the process of deciding what phone to upgrade to. It is between the new Note 5 and the IPhone 6S in about a month, or whenever it comes out. I am currently using a 5C (boo) and sometimes an S4, so I know my way around both OS systems. One of the deciding points (as trivial as it may seem to some) is the slow mo function. I was wondering if anyone knew what the fps is on the Samsung Note 5 Slow Mo function. From what I've seen, the apple devices seem to be superior in that area. I wanted to know if the Note 5 is comparable. edit: grammar
How to get Write on PDF working  Wherever I download a PDF and try to open it, my 2 options are Adobe and Google docs. Either option doesn't support the write on PDF function however in every review I've seen, this is touted as a feature which admittedly would make my life a lot easier. Is anyone able to get this working?Fwiw, I'm a Rogers Note owner.
How fast would the battery degrade? I'd consider myself an average phone user in terms of usage. Social media, texting, pictures and the like. I'm thinking of picking up this phone but I have a very general question.How many years (assuming 1 charge every day) would the Note 5's battery be considered viable for a one day affair?I understand this is a very vague question but I'm just trying to gage exactly how important a replaceable battery is for Android phones. (Coming from an iPhone 4 which has lasted me forever and still holds charge pretty well)
New note 5 user, couple of questions. Hi, great phone so far, however have a few issues maybe someone can help figure them out:1) Data toggle - non existant in the notification tray, any way to bring it back?2) Lockscreen brighteness, my lockscreen wallpapers are noticeably brighter than the dock one, any way to balance it out?3) Since on the topic of wallpapers, where do you guys get yours?So far only this, thanks for any help you can provide!
Package disabler not allowing snapchat on 4g? Is anyone else having this problem? 
Music volume level fluctuates on its own when using headphones It doesn't matter if I'm using Spotify or the stock music app, the volume fades between soft and loud whenever I listen to music. The equalizer settings are set to normal. Nothing like SoundAlive or special 3D/Bass/custom presents are being used. But the volume adjusts multiple times during a song, almost as if someone was constantly moving a dial. This happens if I am streaming music on Spotify (quality settings are at normal) or listening offline. And as stated, even if I'm playing saved music. Multiple headphones and speakers used - it happens on all of them.

Fast charging problems We just picked up a Note 5 and noticed immediately that the Fast Charge feature is hit or miss.  More often than not, when we initially plug in the cable, it says Cable Charging.  We have to remove and plug in a few times for it to say Fast Charging.In doing some quick searching on the Internet, it seems we are not the only ones experiencing this.  Is this a known, confirmed problem by Samsung, and is there a fix for it?  It's pretty frustrating.
Google Play Services for Note 5 run Android Pay Has anybody been able to locate the google play service .apk that works on the Note 5. APKMirror has several variants, however non of them are compatible with the Note 5 that  I am aware of. Trying to get Android Pay up and running. 
Samsung test drive - impressed by battery First full day after depleting down to and then up to full charge for actual usage. Received the phone early yesterday and I've been on it since. This is my first Android phone but I guess you could say I know a few things about optimizing performance from frequently visiting android forums. Anyways I thought 6 hours SOT was impressive.  Quite honestly whenever I visited the android subs,  I got the impression that battery life sucked across the board for like... All users. 
My note 5 stays unlocked HiMy note 5 sometimes doesn't lock (fingerprint security type) ...I have smart lock enabled but sometimes in class when i put my note 5 down for an hour I wake the screen and find it unlocked and just need to swipe .. smart lock only has on body detection and bluetooth device enabled (my car).Anyone has experienced something similar?Thanks!

Problems with my new Note 5 is it a hardware issue? Ok so I recently got my 64gig note 5 after my note 3 finely started getting wierd. Anyway I have several bluetooth speakers and a Bluetooth radio in my car. But about half the time when I go to start playing my audio books,  it won't actually play. Actually this may be a problem with the note 5 and mortplayer for audio books. But I feel like it's probably how the phone is handling it rather than the apps fault. Also I've been trying to play some games on here PvZ 2 for one example and it keeps locking up. For either of these issues the only fix seems to be reseting the phone,  I've never reset a new phone as much as I've had to with this. Any suggestions? Verizon if it matters.

[Help] Activation/unlocking for a new phone? After some hard word and saving money, I decided to finally look into getting myself a newer phone. Two years ago, I bought an unlocked Samsung Galaxy S4 from Best Buy for MetroPCS (my carrier). Now, I am looking into getting a Samsung Galaxy Note 5 (white pearl) from Best Buy, however, it is under Verizon Wireless for a 2-year contract deal. Is there anyway I can unlock the phone online or by any method and buy myself a SIMs card for MetroPCS to use under my carrier or will it be impossible? Or should I look into T-Mobile phones?

Did you root your Note 5? When I got my Note 3 I rooted it right away and installed a custom ROM. I like the idea of being able to customize whatever I want, and getting rid of all the bloatware. Im getting my Note 5 tomorrow, and I don't know if I should root it or not. What did you do and why?
Tethering app Hey guys,  so I'm coming from a iPhone which had a jailbreak app called Tetherme which allowed the phone to be set as a Hotspot without the carrier knowing.

I've used PdaNet and Foxfi and those haven't worked. Please please help.  
Is it possible to disable the notification number on top of apps and folders? Pretty much that. I have my social apps in one folder on my home screen and whenever FB gets anything a number appears next the app icon and then on the folder icon as well. I usually don't check my FB until later and it's just a minor cosmetic inconvenience to have the numbers on the folder. I'm wondering if it's possible to disable that. Thanks everyone!

S Pen upside down? Does it matter which way you stick the pen in? I mean does it matter whether or not the Samsung logo is facing down when you insert the pen? I noticed that today I happened to stick the pen in logo facing down instead of up. Kind of freaked me out! Anyone have an answer to this?
Battery life not that great? About 50% depleted and I only have 2.5 hours of SOT, which equates to about 5 hours (versus the 7 hours many others were reporting).

Galaxy Note 5 to Get 6in 4K AMOLED Display with 700+ppi, Says Samsung's Leaked Roadmap 
Will NOT buy this Galaxy Apple Note 5 I am very disappointed. It seems that Galaxy is deciding to go the route of the sadists at Apple that treat their customers like sheep.That culture at Apple is like a Cult. They force you to do what they say,when they say, they don't let you use other apps unless their Apple. anytime you have a problem you have to go to Apple. Samsung Always allowed you OPTIONS: The option to use ANY apps,The option to remove your battery,the option to add memory by SD card, the option to OPEN your phone. NOW they decide that you can't have an SD to upgrade memory NOW you have to BUY another one.AND THEY HAVE THE NERVE TO DOWNGRADE THE BATTERY POWER!!!!! This is inexcusable,unforgiveable and insulting. I am going to wait until this one TANKS and they come out with the NOTE 6. I am sticking with my NOTE 4.Because I am NOT a DRONE or a SHEEP. I hope the MASSES of SAMSUNG users don't allow SAMSUNG to think that emulating APPLE is going to be good for their bottom line.Don't BUY the NOTE 5 or should I say the Samsung Apple Note 5 its nothing short of an ABOMINATION. A surrendering of Samsung company mantra and Samsung company soul.
My horrible screen protector drama So about a week before the note 5 came out I was sure I was going to buy it so I jumped onto amazon, and I bought a glass screen protector. It delivered the day I got my note 5. awesome! Great timing. I installed it and it had a pretty bad halo effect, I contacted the company and asked for any tips to possibly get the halo to go away. They suggested the very standard stuff push down and from the middle out. I didn't work. They mailed me another one for free to try again, awesome great customer service! They don't even charge shipping. I get that replacement, and I take my time and install it. Halo effect is still there. I email them and let them thanking for the replacement, but the halo is still there, and mention that I have been reading and it seems its a common issues with some protectors so I will just buy a protector from another company, or I would wait until they re design the protector. Not pushing blame, I was still very happy about getting a second crack at it. Just didn't work. They reply in an email and said that the halo effect is due to the curved glass in the Note and that is just the way it will come and they will send me a tradition wet install protector. I figured why not I will give it a try. I have been installing Zagg invisible shields for the last 5 years or so, I figure wont be a big deal to slap that on. I get that replacement in, I was very happy because they actually sent a full body which is great I wanted something to protect the back glass also, so sweet! I get ready to install it, turn the phone off, install everything. Dry it off, and keep it off for two hours. Longest two hours ever. After two hours I power it back on, start replying to everything I missed, and then the screen starts freaking out, I power it back off, double check there isn't any moisture left, none found. I turn it back on, it is still doing it, I bite the bullet and pull the protector off. The screen stops acting up, so good I still have the back installed so I figure I will do what I should have done the first time and go get a glass Zagg from work. I keep using it for awhile, then I decide to charge it a little. I plug it in, makes the plug in chirp, then makes the disconnect sound, it does this four or five times then nothing. It never recognized a usb cable after that. So it seems the first time in the 7 years of installing wet protectors and its my phone that I break :( of course. Luckily I have a wireless charge mat so that was limping me along for awhile, until the store I got my phone at had more in and then they exchange the phone for me since it was so new.The company that made the screen protector had great customer service and mailed me two replacements on their dime. But I am now too scared to put another protector on my new one 
Anyone have any experience with the GS6? One week left before return window closes on my Note 5. Hey everyone, so I really like my Note 5, but I came from an iPhone 5 and It. Is. HUGE. I definitely now want a bigger screen than my 4 iPhone, but 5.7 hurts my thumbs and doesn't fit in my pockets well (I'm a 5'7 male). I'm really enjoying android (except spotify continues to play when I get phone calls), so I'm considering the GS6. Will I notice the loss of 1GB of memory? Is the battery life *that* bad? Thanks for any input you can share!
Battery troubles Hey guys, I can't be the only one that feels the Note 5 battery is a disaster. I can wear the battery down by 10% in literally 2minutes with taking a picture or two, chatting for a minute on whatsapp and googling a thing or two. I used package disbabler to turn off a lot of the bloatware, always have my screen at around 15% brightness, what am I doing wrong? I had to disable the percentage icon on my status bar because it's too tough to see it deplete by the second. I'm seeing people post amazing 7-9 hour screen on times, but starting to believe that's fake, since I can't get past 4, no matter what I do.I can take my phone off the charger at 100%, put it on the aux cord in the car for my 32 minute drive. And it will be down to 91% when i get out of the car. Wtf

Note 4 vs Note 5? Which one is better and why? [x-post from /r/galaxynote4) I currently have a Note 3 and am going to upgrade in the next few months, can someone please tell me why I would want a Note 4 vs a Note 5 or vice versa? No MicroSD card for the Note 5 is a huge disappointment for me, however the improved specs are impressive.  Thoughts?
Update broke charging I used to be able to charge with anything and it always charged faster than it drained while using it. Since this last update it charges extremely slowly with anything but the factory charger. Is anyone else experiencing this? It's the Verizon version BTW. 
Jumping to iPhone 6s I feel like I'm the only one on the internet with this opinion, but I wanted to get some feedback on my usage of the Note 5 and if I'm just overreacting here. (getting 6s anyway)1. Bloat:  When an app like Package Disabler is created with the sole purpose of making a Galaxy phone manageable, there's a serious issue.  And no, I didn't end up using it. the day I pay for a Pro app just to turn off other apps is the day I eat a gun. 2. Lag: For real samsung?  I know every phone under the sun will lag after you put on a bunch of apps that all run in the background and eat up memory, but this phone has 4GB of RAM!!  when I get a good day of use out of the phone, there might be around 20-25 apps in the recent apps page, but by that time, just hitting the recent apps button takes a solid 2 seconds or more to actually pop up. hitting the home button also takes around 2 seconds, then the homescreen redraws.  This is crazy. None of the apps i have here are games of any kind. just basic chrome tabs and social/work apps. and I usually have 1.7 to 1.9 GB of free RAM just sitting around. 3. Battery: I'm on T-Mobile. I use Battery Saving Mode almost 100% of the time. I never get more than 2.5 hours screen on time.  Dont care what apps I'm using. Don't care that I'm exclusively on 4G LTE (unlimited data, I'm using it).  I've gotten great battery on the iPhone 6, LG G3, and Moto G that doubles this phone with the same usage. This is just bad. 4. .....sigh.............Iunno.  I gave it a month. I tried to like Samsung's way of handling UI.... I just must not be the right user for it.  I had the most fun with my iPhone 6 and still have to keep an iPad Mini on hand for the iOS only apps I couldn't give up when I sold the 6. It just makes more sense to use my free Jump from T-Mobile and get a phone I'll like. 
Quick Charge 2.works with Note 5 
Can't decide if I should make the switch from Iphone to Note 5 or G4. Words of advice much appreciated! I have an Iphone 5s and was thinking of getting the new 6s. I don??t particularly want to support Apple anymore and the Iphone is kind of boring now, so I decided I want an Android. The Note 5 seems awesome with the following exceptions (not to beat a dead horse):1.No removable batter/sd card (this isn??t actually too big a deal for me)2.I read people hate touchwiz ??is it really that bad?3.Battery life/future battery life4.Long wait period for Samsung updatesEven with these cons, the Note 5 seems very enticing. Other than that, I was thinking of the LG G4. What do you think? Perhaps some of you can share experiences with the N5/G4, and if you wholeheartedly recommend a switch from Iphone.I appreciate your time!

Note 5 Backwards S-Pen Button Extraction This is going to be a common issue popping up for sure, 2 days in and I already have seen a bunch of users with this problem.  It is simply a bad design and it is quite easy to ruin your 50$ s-pen with this problem.   There is no reason they should have designed it in the matter.  The button tip should be bigger than the hole and there should be an area in the casing machined out slightly bigger to allow it to sit flush.  It will be an easy revision if they choose to do it, otherwise I foresee some social media anger in the not too distant future, if the Note 5 Active doesn't quickly overshadow this model.   You know what I brought though? Solutions.      This major problem is that the S-pen clicker gets stuck in the holster port after you extract it after putting it in backwards. Inside the holster port is little catches that normally keep the s-pen in place, when the clicker button engages this it becomes stuck to the point where it can pop off the s-pen when extracting it.  The good news is that the button can be extracted, you have to build a tool to do so.      The tool you need a long, thin rod with a small barb on the end of it.  You insert this tool into the space between the button body and the holster port walls, you twist it in so the barbed hook engages the button body then you pull.  Eventually you can work the button out.  You can build this tool from a relatively thick paper clip.  Straighten the paper clip out, bend one side into a handle and the other side into a small hook.  Use a pair of wire cutters to cut the hook into a small sharp point.  When using this extraction tool you make need to utilize a small pair of pliers on the handle to get enough force both when twisting and when pulling out.        Let me be clear, I have no idea if this make cause damage to the internals of the holster port, but it beats sending it out for warranty with a button stuck inside it.  Once replacement Note-5 S-pens are out I'll test to see if there is any damage.  I may try to repair my s-pen with a small bit of epoxy on the button mating nib.  But I'll do some testing before I try to stick it back inside (in the correct orientation).https://snarky.smugmug.com/Spenextractor/i-W9DZk2p/0/L/20150824_135823-L.jpgTwo versions of the tool with source paper clip.  A pair of wire cutters and LED light will be handy.     https://snarky.smugmug.com/Spenextractor/i-whRHsG4/0/L/20150824_135845-L.jpgA closer view of the barbs tips.  You make have to trail and error the angle of the bend and the sizing.  The width of the hook diameter here is about 4mm.      https://snarky.smugmug.com/Spenextractor/i-g8xF8jf/0/L/20150824_140050-L.jpgFinally, here is that little bugger extracted.  Like I said, I'm going to see if I can reuse it.  If I get a positive response from actually posting this solution here, I'll post the repair of the s-pen here too.      Thank you guys, hope this helps some of you.

Deciding between nexus 6 and note 5. So I just purchased the Nexus 6 and I love it but I also love my note 5. I love how I don't feel like I have to root the device at all where as with my nexus 6 I feel like I have to root it because it is missing half of the features that I like to have in my phones like the back button on the right. Question, I know there has been root released for the tmobile note 5....should I be worried for jod or insurance purposes about rooting it if I decide to in the future? I know rooting trips Knox so I'm worried a bit so that's why I haven't yet.

Anyone else having location issues? I first noticed a problem when my Pebble started showing wacky weather stats a few days ago. When I open maps or any other GPS app, my location is spot on. I have enabled location services to use wifi, data, and gps for location.My weather data on my phone and on my watch think I'm somewhere totally different: https://i.imgur.com/1U6ftJ0.pngI'm actually in Florida. Is anyone else having problems?

getting a Note 5 soon , want your recommendation for a good case with a Kickstand Hello I'm getting a Note 5 soon , I was choosing between Lumia 950xl and the Note 5 , in the end decided to go with the Note 5 for the pen (I considered Lumia 950xl because it was rumored to support a pen ) , anyway I want a your recommendation for a case with a Kickstand 
Slow wifi Anyone having issues with the WiFi speeds on their note 5? Mine is considerably slower on WiFi than lte, almost 3g slow. I've tried clearing the cache on my phone forgetting the network and resetting the router. Any other ideas how to fix this?
Distorted Noises/Chirping when listening to music when headphones plugged in? Has anyone else experienced sound issues when listening to music over headphones? Every now and then I will get a weird chirping sound or distorted noise. It doesn't seem to happen when I am listening to music over Bluetooth, and I just bought a new pair of headphones because I thought that was the issue, but it is still happening. I am currently listening to Spotify and it doesn't seem to be happening, but it happens pretty frequently (2-3 times a song, not every song, maybe every other song or so, randomly) when using the default music app.Any ideas?
Samsung Pay - day one, short review Firstly, it works seamlessly and easily. Anywhere that I would normally swipe my card (emphasis on the specificity of the word swipe as it won't work on ATMs or gas pumps where you need to physically insert your card), all I had to do was hold my phone next to the reader and it just worked. No second guessing how or where I held the device, just stick it next to the strip reader and it picked up my signal no problem, every time. I also got a notification shortly after each transaction telling me the amount of the transaction (which I liked, but you can disable notifications). It then keeps a log of my transaction in the info page for each card (which I also like). All positives so far and no negatives!The only thing that I think I underestimated was just how many places require you to hand your card over. I made about ten transactions today and only 4 of them were with Samsung Pay. Eight of them probably could have been made with Samsung Pay if I was willing to hand over my $80phone to a perfect stranger working for $10/hr who doesn't care if they drop my phone or not.On a related note, now that it's clear to /r/android (read: Note 5 haters) what Samsung Pay is, they've changed their tune from saying it's just another shitty third party bloatware app to saying chip and pin cards are the actual way of the future so MST is useless. Both of the cards I've programmed into Samsung Pay have chips and need to be inserted at certain stores under certain circumstances (I think it's triggered over a certain dollar amount) and they worked with Samsung Pay without requiring the chip insertion (due to the fact that virtual card numbers are used by the app I suspect). But the bottom line is it works on chip and pin machines no problem and I've never seen a chip and pin machine without a magnetic strip reader.And one concern: I've got my debit card right next to the back of my phone in a case with a card slot ... I'm worried that the MST will damage the magnetic strip on my card. So far it still works after activating the MST at least a dozen times, but I'm pretty pessimistic about the safety of my card.Summary: it works, but you'll still need a physical card.
Note 5 supposedly to include with auto eject pen. 
First day using the Note 5, battery seemed to be doing good, but then I checked and saw Gmail. Need help with optimisation I was getting around 4hrs of SoT which seemed fine to me. However, the second app which sucked the most battery was Gmail, which was kinda a surprise as I didnt even open it during the day. I have one google account, and 2 hotmail accounts on it. Is there any way where I can reduce the frequency of syncing? I set it to check every hour but it still takes too much juice I think.Any alternative apps for the Note 5 which checks email but doesnt take so much juice?This brings me to my next question. I've decided not to root my phone this time around, I've set the DPI to around 50with the help of another thread and for now, it feels like I can live without rooting. Only the camera looks wonky but that's ok. What I did want to know is, I want to set the phone into such a state where, all mobile data is turned off, and the phone switches it on every 15mins or so, just to check for notifications instead of always being turned on, and using more battery in the process. As far as I'm aware, I can't use tasker for this as it needs root to toggel 3G. So is there any other way I can set the phone to do this via any app? Or maybe at least just use 2G and not 3G when the phone is not being used and in my pocket?Thanks in advance!
PSA: Hidden in the settings, you can set up a Samsung equivalent of Guided Access to prevent a kid or friends from goofing with your phone when you hand it over. There's also a Guided Access kids app. I don't recommend handing over this expensive device to a child or a not-so-good friend, but if you do, protect your apps and data!There are actually 2 functions in your phone for app/screen locking and one additional download by Samsung for a Kids App.Option 1:Accessibility&gtDexterity and Interaction&gtInteraction ControlWhen activated, you can press Home+Volume Down to restrict touch, the power key, the volume key, and keyboard. You can pick and choose how you want it done - for me, I just have the power key turned off.  The app by default turns off auto rotate, hides new notifications, and turns off all your home key buttons, essentially locking a person into the app you place them into.  Most importantly, when you activate it, you get to pick what parts of the screen are locked.This is the perfect tool for kids.  You can put them into a single app, turn on the smart lock, and let them play.  Or, start a playlist of videos, lock the phone, and let them play.  Unless you lock the whole screen, this won't stop jerky-mcjerkerson from flipping through your whole camera roll, though.  I'd suggest locking the whole screen for that one.Some of your friends could get clever, though, and figure out who to unlock your phone.  In that case, you may want to use app pinning...Option 2:Settings &gt Lock Screens and Security &gt Other Security Settings &gt Pin windowsThis allows you to pin an app.  Once activated, when you go to your recent apps, a pin will show up on the bottom right side of the app.  If you click it, your phone will be pinned to that app.  Whoever uses the phone can do anything the app allows, but they won't be able to leave the app.  When they try, they will be booted to your lock screen (provided that is left on when you set up pinning).  If you have a fingerprint set up, then they won't be able to get into your phone without your help once they leave the app.This is perfect to give to someone if you want them to demo an app or make a phone call.  It's invaluable if the person you give the phone to knows how to turn off Interaction Control.To sum it up, Interaction Control is better for kids and granular control situations, since you can prevent a person from locking your device, changing the volume, typing, or even doing anything on the screen.  App Pinning is better for  older kids and untrustworthy adults, since the person can actually use the lock button, volume keys, and keyboard, but will be automatically booted to your fingerprint reader if they lock the screen or attempt to turn off app pinning.Option 3: Kids App.In Google Play or the Samsung app store, download Kidstime App for Kids (**Note:** Apparently Samsung doesn't want to support this yet for the Note 5. I reached out and will let you know if I get a reply).  Kids Mode is another available app.Kids mode is a free option that has a camera, animated activity zone, and more.  KidsTime App for kids comes with 3free games and books and a subscription service ($5/month) for 10apps and books, curated with more added over time.  Both services allow you to control the lockscreen and prevent in-app purchases.Kids Mode should be good enough, since you can download your own assortment of apps and approve them inside Kids Mode to be available in that launcher.  You can also set approved contacts and allow your kids to make calls from Kids Mode.
Mirror Image and video for the front camera, are there any ways to change this? Hey guys, wanna check with you all, the front camera is actually saving selfies as mirror image. I heard that in Note 4, there's an option to save as flipped. I can't find it in Note 5 though, am I missing something? Or are there any other solutions to this?*I think even the rear camera is affected. :&lt
Based on what we know now, would you rather get a Note 5 or an S6? I'm debating between these two, and I'd love to hear other people's opinions. I'm waiting to get an S6 to see what the Note 5 looks like.I am excited to also get a Samsung VR, which has a model for the S6 and the Note 4. I assume that also means there will be one for the Note 5.Battery life is a big deal for me, because I'll be tethering a lot and expect that to be a power drain. Will have to wait to get exact tests on which lives longer...Size is not too much of an issue for me. I like the bigger Note formfactor, but the S6 is big enough.Price might be a selling point. Since the S6 has been out for a bit, maybe there'll be some kind of deal in August/September that makes it notably cheaper than the Note 5? I'm on T-Mobile so would be buying this full price.Anyone out there right now have an S6 and is regreting it/considering switching? How about people like me who want an S6 but waiting to see if the Note 5 is cooler/better?
I recommend you use the camera on this phone a few times, even if you have nothing and nobody to photograph. It's making me wonder what's possible in the future for pocket sized cameras 
How does everyone like the Youtube live broadcast? I tried it out today and I was really impressed with it. Seems like 1080p is the highest resolution it supports, but the picture quality was great on the live broadcast.
Does Samsung pay need NFC to be turned on or does it automatically turn on when you launch Pay? [deleted]
[Advice] Planning on purchasing my first ever note 5 on Tuesday for my birthday, need help making sure I'am buying something legit. I am not planning on buying the device from some unknown retailer, however I just want to be able to look up the IMEI or something so I can be sure that I've purchased an original device. I know with apple products you can look up the serial number on their website, however I wasn't able to find anything like that from Samsung and was wondering if anyone knew where I could look up this info when I do make the purchase? I only ask because retailers are infamous in my country for selling really well made fakes coming from China. 
Set your screen to AMOLED cinema It looks way better and completely removes any subtle discolouration you might think is there. I don't think it's a bigger drain on battery, so do comment if it is.Settings&gtDisplay&gtScreen mode
The free wireless charger from Samsung Pay promo on backorder Has anyone actually received the wireless charger from the promotion? I keep getting emails telling me it's on backorder. I signed up for Samsung Pay 2 days after getting the notification of the promo (about a month ago). I find it strange that Samsung wouldn't have planned better to ensure they had sufficient stock to support the promotion.
USB connection not working? A couple of days ago I was able to transfer my music onto my note 5 through a USB connection.I??ve been trying to transfer some more files but my computer can??t recognize my phone anymore. I??ve tried reinstalling the drivers, restarting my phone, restarting my computer, switching cables, nothing works. I??ve also tried using sidesync and it won??t connect either.I suspect it might have something to do with the packages that I??ve disabled in package disabler but I don??t know which one it could be.My disabled packages: http://imgur.com/6wtSUPs.jpg

Available Storage After watching plenty of review videos, I haven't been able to find out how much available storage there is on the device out of the box.. I'm deciding between a 32 and 64 GB Note 5 and I don't want to get a 32 gig and end up filling it up too quick.When I was at Best buy it said there was only like 13 gigs or something available, which seemed absurd to me, but I figured this had to do with the store OS they put on there for demos.. So can any one help me out here?!
Is there a way to disable that dumb listening at high volume nonsense warning. 
Disable notification sounds and interruptions when listening to music/watching a video? I'm trying to find a way to do as the title states. I hate when I get texts/calls when I'm listening to music and it turns my music down and plays a tone. Not only that, but it will play the tone through my headphones AND the speaker on the phone. I see no way to disable this in the settings. I tried the Don't Pause app, which is supposed to set them all to vibrate, but it doesn't work. Anyone have a solution to this?
New flairs and better UI for usability [deleted]
Samsung I hate you so much So I generally go through phones like crazy, I always have to have the latest and greatest. At my peak I was getting a different phone once a month (I know it's insane) I have been a more manageable every 60-9days. Well here is the problem I have with my note 5. The new iPhone just released and at this time of year that's the next phone to try. My note is almost paid of, I would just be jumping onto the next phone. EXCEPT now I have samsung pay setup and working, I can't leave. I love it, it's the future to me. I find myself not wanting to even look at a new phone. Samsung has found a way to keep me tied to this phone. 
Default programs (possibly) not working correctly Is anyone else having an issue where you click on a link in google search to open up a browser and it always asks which browser to use?  I always select the same browser and it tells me where to go and edit the defaults, however the next time I click on a link it does the same thing.  I do go to the default application setup, and the browser is there, however it doesn't appear to be working.

Anybody have Cell standby draining battery on T-Mobile Note 5? Cell standby has been at the top of my battery drain and im only getting around 12 hours of battery with about 2 hours of SOT. I have quick chargers all over the place but still I would like to not have to worry about that.Any suggestions on getting rid of it short of going into airplane mode?

Anyone have luck with tempered glass screen protectors? I ordered a Yootech tempered glass screen protector but it suffers from the dreaded halo effect, where the edges of the glass do not adhere to the display due to the Note 5's slight display curvature along the edges.This is evidently common among many tempered glass protectors and it is tough to determine which ones (if any) won't have the halo issue.Do you guys have any recommendations? 
New Note5 owner. Hey guys, I'm recently came back to Android after a few years of iOS usage. I used to root and do all that good stuff back in the day when slide out keyboards were the shit, and I'm completely out of the loop for Android now. Any apps, tricks, tips, general help, step by step instructions to get the most out of my phone? I'm a dental student if that means anything to anyone. As always, thanks Reddit for the help! I read some of the other pages but I feel like a unified New to Note 5 page would be helpful and I need them lol.
Alternative to wireless fast charge? Is there a product out there besides the one samsung provides that will allow us to fast charge wireless? 
Those of you with the international models, do you experience the subtle lag that users on carrier models experience? ^ just curious if you experience the type of lag that someone on say, ATT or Verizon may experience with the bloat they load on. I'm in the US and looking to purchase an international model for the updates alone. 
The featureless Galaxy Note 5 Lets talk for a bit. So far we have a really good idea of how the Note 5 is going to be, and we're certain that it'll cost between $700-$800. What exactly are we paying for? So far we know we're not getting an IR blaster we're not getting SD card slot we don't appear to be getting any sizable upgrades over the Note 4 other than higher specs.

I ran into a problem and I remember seeing someone post about it. My cousin was messing around with the s pen by just clicking it. Then after it stopped clicking. The spring or something is out of place? 
I'm getting a Note 5 tomorrow and I'm honestly worried about a few things So as a little back story, I'm upgrading from a galaxy s5. I've had the phone for a year now and it was great... until Lollipop rolled out and just turned my s5 into a slug. (I was on sprint) So tomorrow I'm getting T-mobile to buy me out of my contract and I will be upgrading to the Note 5. Here is what I'm worried about: Will it stay updated? That's all I care about mostly. If I had the money, I'd be getting a Nexus 6p (for those updates) but right now, getting that phone is not an option.A few questions:Are you guys happy with your Note 5s?Is there anywhere I can sell my s5 case? I spent a lot on a Spigen case and I would want to use the cash I spent on it to put towards a case for the Note 5 if possible. (budgets lol)And that's about it. When I first saw the Note 5, I wanted it right away, but with my experience with my s5 and how slow the updates came, I became attracted to the Nexus 6p. As that is not an option for me, I have decided that the Note 5 is my best bet. I know I will love it. Just worried about software updates.Plus, if you guys have any tips or any sweet deals I can take advantage of with T-Mobile, let me know. I'd appreciate it all. (:
Email sync going too far back? Recently I've been getting email notifications from emails I know I have already deleted. Like I'll get a notification saying 26 new emails and I'll go to the stock email app and  the emails are old unread emails from March to before. Has anyone experienced this? Is it a setting I can change on my phone or app settings? Is this a server issue? I had a Note 3 previously and didn't ever have this problem. I've tried signing in and out of my email accounts and I've tried restarted the phone several times. I'm with T-Mobile, if it makes a difference. 
Is there a safe and proven way to root the Note 5 ? I have seen a few 1 click roots but I don't think they are trusty. Help? Like topic says, I just want to root my phone. I understand it disables samsung pay, but that's it right? I don't want to use that feature anyways. How can I root it?
Galaxy Note 5 Battery tips how to save battery 
My Note 5 lasted 12 days before dying forever... http://imgur.com/0jBKVuC This is the sight that befell me after just 12 short days of owning my Note 5. I will preface this post by saying that i've never broken, dropped or dented a single phone, Note 5 included. It was sporting a tempered glass screen protector from day 1 and never had a single drop, bump or nick. It was in flawless condition when this happened. I was mid call on my Note 5 when it happened. I went to hang up the phone and my screen wasn't responding. Thinking that it was a bug of some kind, I restarted my phone. To no avail -  it still didn't work. After a half hour of fretting and googling I saw it. At first it was just a tiny purple spec on the top left hand corner of my screen -  barely visible. Within the hour it had spread to my entire carrier symbol. By the end of the day, my screen looked like the photo above. I sent it away to Optus and they agreed to replace the phone -  no charge. However, I am nervous to take another Note 5 given my bad experience. Has anyone else seen anything like this?  Any advice?
Memo App Hey guys,  need some help.  Just recently got the Note 5 coming from an S5. Thought I backed up everything I was going to need to transfer to the Note,  but to my horror,  I didn't think to back up my memos.   I have factory reset my old S5 and created a new Google and Samsung account for my wife.   Now  on my Note5 I'm using the same account for Google and Samsung,  but the Memo App doesn't seem to be installed on the Note5. I installed it from the Galaxy App store,  but there are no options to sync or restore.   Am I SOL? 
Still worth it? Hi everyone,I am thinking of paying out my contract and starting a new one so I can grab the note 5. My only worry is that the phone came out in August and the s7 will maybe be coming out soon (with possible SD support even) which means the note 5 may fall to the wayside and not received marshmallow for months e.g. Kind of like the note 4 did (I had one).Basically I'm asking if I should pull the trigger and pick up the note 5 sometime this weekend. Bit of further info/backgroundI would be hoping to root and install xposed for minminguard and would be open to cm13 if marshmallow is delayed. Thank you guys and gals :) 
What does your home screen look like? Here's mine. 
Verizon Note 5 Update (Samsung Pay) Just starting a thread to see when people have received their update. Probably like many, I sideloaded the Samsung Pay Framework and cannot install the new Samsung Pay app without getting a Framework error. I'm really hoping I don't have to do a factory reset. Please update if you've upgraded and if this corrected the framework issue. As of 2:04 PM EST, no update to my Note 5.Updated: Installed new update at 2 PM EST and I'm able to get to the page where I can add a card. Left my wallet at home so can't confirm but is looking good. It got rid of the framework issue so that should be all set. One user said that their SMS and MMS stopped working. Please comment below if you are or aren't experiencing this issue

Are you happy with your Note 5? Ex- iPhone user So I'm due for an upgrade from my IPhone 6 plus and I've been researching for days on android phones. I've narrowed it down to the note 5 and the edge plus. However, I've seen a lot of people complaining about the ram management on the phone. On my iPhone, a lot of my apps close after a while too. How do you like your note 5 though? Or is there a better phone to look into? 
So I'm thinking of buying a Note 5, and I have a few questions. I'm seriously considering purchasing a 64GB Black Galaxy Note 5, but I have a few questions I hope you guys can answer for me. I'm planning on using this phone mostly on T-Mobile (over 95% of the time), and occasionally switching to AT&ampT (i use prepaid plans on both networks).1. Is there any difference in what antennas are in the phone between the international version of the phone, and the t-mobile/at&ampt versions of the phone?2. Should I buy the t-mobile version of the phone, then pay to unlock it? Or buy the unlocked international version instead?3. Where's the cheapest place to buy the 64GB version of the phone for all 3 versions listed above?4. How hard is it to root this phone? Is it possible to remove the Samsung bloatware/touchwiz software from the phone, and if so what would be the downsides to this?
What happened to the pedometer on lockscreen? I am so pissed that this feature is gone. I always peeked at my step count all day long. 
Poor battery life. How do I improve? So I came to the note 5 from my iPhone 6 (not 6plus) and so far it's a fun experience. I've been on android before but this is the best experience I've had so far since the software is finally quick and consistent and has far fewer stuttering than before but there is still one nagging issue that remains which is poor battery life. Yesterday was my first full day with the note 5 and it was shocking how fast the battery drains on this phone especially when compared to the iPhone 6. For instance, my normal morning commute involves about an hour or so of podcast listening to downloaded episodes. I don't use the screen much at all. By the time I arrived at work, my iPhone would almost always be still at 100%. The note 5 on the other hand was down to 94%.My day continues with some light texting at work and about 45 min to an hour of video streaming through netflix or Hulu etc on lunch. By 5pm my iPhone always had around 60% charge. Maybe it would dip into high 50s if I used it harder but never below 55% before 5pm. The note 5 yesterday was dropping to 60-55% by 2:30. It seems that the note is at least 10% - 15% worse on the battery so far. Even on the two times I've left the phone at 100% overnight the next morning the phone is at 95% without me touching it. IPhone could stay at 100% all day if I don't use it.Any time I actually use the phone whether it be to text or check a quick feed, I can literally watch the battery life tick down almost as if I have to pay 1% for every single action I do with the phone. I never noticed with my iPhone. I just feel a lot less confident with this battery and really would love to improve it to at least get it close to where the iPhone 6 was. The one saving grace is the quick charger which is shockingly fast to recharge. I love that feature but I don't want to bring the charger to and from work or have to buy a second one. I don't have to worry about getting to an outlet. I NEVER worried with the iPhone. It always made it to bedtime no matter what. Please help me right the ship here. So far I've been running the brightness at around 25-30% as always. Sync is turned off as I do this manually.

Does it get better I've stayed away from Samsung for a long time but decided to give them another shot, especially since I can upgrade a lot through tmobile. Well, I have had this phone for 5 days now and the battery is horrible. I send a text message and it goes down 1% each time.  I have tried the turning off the volte thing and lots of stuff people have recommended and it's still atrocious. The screen is the biggest culprit, but I think that's fairly normal So, does it settle down at all and stop sucking? Do I maybe have a defective phone? Because at this point, I'm really regretting a Samsung again. 
Is there a good and cheap case available right now for the Note 5 ? 
Battery Problem, mediaserver? 3rd day having this phone, first day I was amazed by the battery life and I loved it. 2nd day it was slowly ticking away faster than usual. I didn't really think it was much. 3rd day, today, and suddenly the battery can't last more than 5 hours, my phone gets hot really fast as well. It seemed like when the phone is on and is being used, 1 percent lasts 2 minutes. I checked whats draining it and I saw mediaserver. Any suggestions and help?

Where are Samsung Tasks? I was just curious where the Samsung Tasks are for the Note 5. I'm coming from a Note 4, and with that phone I was just able to open up the calendar app and select Tasks. It doesn't look like that's an option with the Note 5 and I have to set an actual calendar event for a reminder. Any ideas or suggestions? Thanks!
Note 5 in Canada Got the black version (32gb) from a Bell store in Canada (BC).Been using it for a few days now, just only added instagram/snapchat/facebook etc on it so far.Are there any apps, tricks or optimizations that people have done to make the phone 'better'? I don't really use any of the Samsung apps, and i'm not sure if its possible to remove or uninstall those, if not, would it just be disabling them to increase performance?Does anyone else know how the Samsung promotions currently work? I know there's the samsung pay, but my friend suggested I wait until there is a really eye catching offer out there (He said the best is a 100$ gift card for use on the samsung store only). Or should I just grab what I can now and go with it?On a side note, does anyone else dislike the Black/Blue color scheme? I really wanted either the Gold or the Silver to differentiate from most of the S6 Edges and stuff out there, and the fingerprints on the back seem more noticable in the black color. Does anyone have a case suggestion out there? I used to use one of those plastic covering ones, but those seem to make the phone even bigger in the pocket than it already is.

Fast charge not working on first, second, third, even fourth time plugging in? My phone often requires several unplugs and plugs to get the Fast Charge initiated. Not sure what's causing that. Anyone else?
Problems with glass screen protectors? I was just about to pull the trigger on a Zagg glass protector, but saw all kinds of complaining.  Apparently the glass doesn't fit the curvature of the screen well in some cases and there is a halo effect issue? Also, the Otterbox Commuter case I'm using causes problems. Anyone have first hand experience? 
Whats the best camera setting to take fireworks pics at night? I can use trial and error but hoping someone can advise.
Looks like us Verizon customers are getting a chance at the Samsung pay promotion... 
Can the capacitive button lights be disabled on the note 5? There is an app that allows this on the s6. Is there any way to do this yet with the note 5?
Can I not disable mobile data? [deleted]
Youtube the video 101 things for note5 
I've had mine on for a week now I love it but when I put a case on it tends to move as I use the full front skin and not just the top and bottom pieces because it just looks better, for the most part I have just kinda been using it without a case and I am loving it so far. ( white leather front, mahogany back with white leather on the camera)
go on the dialer and type in ##873283# will do a full prl and profile update, run a speed test before and after see if it helps.
I tried briefly, but it made no response. It should still have battery, based on its last remaining battery life.  Took it to Verizon, they tried all the stuff I already tried, had no clues. Getting a brand new replacement at least since it's within 15 days, but have to mail it in because it's a 64GB and nobody keeps it in stock.
Action memo. Do you have the note 5?
Overall pretty well I'd say. I got some other apps and games and they're mostly smooth. Rayman Adventures and Angry Birds run well enough, and Drastic emulator seems fine as well. There are some games where framerate seems like it could be higher but it's not as bas as Aaaaaa
how does it let you know that its fast charging?
The S-pen has always came with two types of tips. There's the black tip which comes on the S-pen, and then there's the grey tip used for screen protectors. Not tempered glass though, you can use the normal tip for that. In the box your note came with should be an tip removal tool and a bag of about 3 extra black tips and 3 grey tips. Try them both and see which one you like the most. it is true that the pen uses electro magnetic fields to write. Hence the reason you can write thru objects,  the tips just have different amounts of friction associated with them. 
My PC has no WiFi connection, but it shares a network with a wireless router. If the phone is on the same sub net with that WiFi router, it will work. I've found the WiFi sleep settings can be problematic when using this setup. USB is a lot more reliable since it's a direct connection. I will play with the Bluetooth setup today and see what happens. My PC has BT as well.
Touchwiz isnt really that bad on the Note, and once you replace the home launcher its virtually nonexistent. After applying the debloat fix on my note found in the XDA forums my battery life is insane. I imagine it will get even better with the release of M.With the exception of pure google devices this is an issue with almost all manufacturers. Mainly because of the phone companies. As far as the G4 goes I wouldn't get it. Its a nice phone but the Note is MUCH nicer, especially for someone coming from the build quality of an iphone. The note 5 will be very close in that regard. My wife has the G4 and its a great phone but after using both there is no doubt the note 5 is the right choice. 
Just got one with built in wireless charging for mine. Didn't really need it but had 20credit trade in at the Verizon store that I had to blow. 
Interesting you say that as the default keyboard is definitely channeling the Google keyboard look. There is a dark theme in the options if you prefer that. 
I went with a Spigen hd plastic protector, it's pretty much invisible. The s-pen is a little less smooth (or slippery depending on your point of view) but still works great.Been reading a lot of reports of halos with tempered glass on the note 5 due to the curved screen edges, is that a non issue?I got it mostly because the screen scratches very easily, not sure it provides any drop protection.
I actually had one last week. Fell about 3 feet onto the parking lot ground. Only the bottom corners of the screen protector cracked. So, $8 has already saved me $175.
Yeah, I got the update this morning.
Huh.  I'm not having that problem at all, using it with my car bluetooth, a couple different headsets at work, and my earbud at home.  I wonder if you have a handset with a defective bluetooth radio?  
Thank you for your input! I'm curious about the pen,  what type of features does it have? 
Most significantly, tempered glass provides more protection for the screen.  It's harder, and it prevents cracks better.  I also think they maintain more visibility than plastic.  Honestly, I see no advantage to plastic whatsoever.**Edit:** Ok well maybe price, but you're only talking about a difference of a few bucks, which is immaterial when it comes to protecting an $85device.
[here's](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00R0ZAMTM?psc=1&ampredirect=true&ampref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00) a link.  Mine came in yesterday and it does work.  Plus it comes with an mini-usb to regular usb adapter so you can transfer files to and from your computer.  I just put in the SD card, plugged it into the mini usb port on the phone and the phone opened it right up and I could access the files on it.  cheap and it works.the only reason I'd say it's not a full solution to the no SD card slot issue is because it hangs off the end of phone (instead of being tucked safely inside of it) so it would be subject to damage - to the phone.  Best to use it by plugging it in to transfer files and then remove it asap. The other problem is that you can't be plugged in to a charger while using it.  Wireless charging would fix that.  Much, much better than nothing though.  
If this had a USB input also it would be perfect.
For the folks that don't already have a microSD card, you can get a OTG flash drive such as this http://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-connector-Android-Devices--SDDD2-064G-G46/dp/B00RBGYGPG/ref=sr_1_1?s=pc&ampie=UTF8&ampqid=1442499534&ampsr=1-1&ampkeywords=otg+flash+drive
It's in the video around the 3min mark when they talk about the stylus. They don't talk about the app just that it has good hand writing recognition. 
For some reason it was doing it on my m9 also, I have been using the Google keyboard to help. The Google keyboard seemingly stopped most of the lag, for whatever reason the Samsung keyboard and hangouts is just an awful pairing.
The back is .079 [2.00mm] thick. It also raises above the screen a bit (good for preventing scratches if you place it face down on a table) with an overall thickness of 0.432 [10.97mm].The side bezels on the Note 5 are so thin that sometimes the raised rim from the case makes it difficult to register a touch on the extreme edge, but I will take the added protection over the rare inconvenience.  
Does anyone know why my split screen view doesn't show that little button in the middle in between apps? I can't figure out how to adjust the size of the windows. 
Our phone is capable doing long exposure photos!Used pro mode in camera and a led light.You need to set exposure(shutter speed) 5 or 10secs depending on what you will draw. Put your phone somewhere , and a timer would help you while you are gettin in position. When you hear the timer sound open your led and start drawing until you hear the picture sound. Thats all! 
While Samsung Pay may not work 10% of the time, it's still better to use it because of all the corporate hacks going on. By using Samsung Pay, your CC info is tokenized so if a retailer gets hacked, your real number and info is not exposed.  From a security aspect, I would prefer using Samsung Pay over my real CC any day.
I used to be obsessed with SOT. I have my phone rooted. Auto sync off. Google app on only when I need to use dictation for texts. Screen on basic, brightness below 50, etc. I get a minimum of 6 hours SOT, a max of 8 -sometimes more. I stopped checking, though. With the fast charger, I just keep the battery topped off consistently at 80, and just don't worry about it anymore.
Okay. I'll try some of these and see what happens. I love the phone but I find myself constantly monitoring my battery and having to charge. Thanks guys. 
Mine is doing the same thing im rooted so im going to flash another rom and see if that helps
It definitely still gave the shutter sound for the two photos it didn't take. 
What overlay? I have fingerprint authentication and don't see an overlay.
Get Doze. Oh man does it help. I just went a full 24 without charging. 
Let me know how it works out.  I had another video on my personal youtube channel for a fix of the same bluetooth issues with the Note 4 that people who had other Android devices commented saying it fixed. 
The second part of your answer is correct.  **Settings** -&gt **Applications** -&gt **Default Applications** -&gt **Press Clear** (on MX Video).I think you're getting downvoted because resetting the phone DOESN'T clear the defaults.  (That would be horrible...)  Factory resetting the phone, however, will clear the defaults.
I see.  If a new sim produces the same error then it might actually be the phone.  Did you blow out the sim slot with a little air to remove any debris that might have gotten in there? 
The camera on the Note 5 is excellent. I find the detail better than the iPhone and miles better than the Xperia Z1 I had before (both of which are solid cameras to begin with). I leave my dedicated point and shoot camera behind when I go on vacation now.
I got my N920I from eBay dispatched from the UK for ??420. You won't get warranty anywhere other than from the seller because the note 5 isn't available in Europe.
Just go into settings&gtdisplay&gtfont&gtdownload new fonts. http://imgur.com/yDsGXwW
Welcome! Since you posted in this subreddit, I'm assuming you went with the Note 5, so some of these tips are phone specific. Some may be region-specific as well. Here are all of my tips, apologies if someone else mentioned them as well :) **Apps to Download*** [Google Opinion Rewards (Free)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.paidtasks&amphl=en) | Surveys from Google for Google Play credit. Google Play is the equivalent of the App Store, and recently made it so you can split app cost between credit and other payment methods, e.g. a credit card. Make sure you have location enabled, as many surveys are location-based. If you save up you can use this money to get all of your premium apps.* [Samsung Pay (Free)](http://www.samsung.com/us/samsung-pay/?cid=ppc-) | This is probably already on your phone, but you should set up a credit or debit card. Unlike Apple Pay or Android Pay, Samsung Pay works at many terminals that don't have NFC. MST technology allows your phone to imitate the magnetic strip of a card. Simply swipe up from the bottom of your screen to open the app (if you have that option enabled - I set it up to open from either screen off or the lock screen), use the fingerprint sensor and hold the phone over either the NFC location or over where you would normally swipe a card. The only place it definitely doesn't work are places which have deep readers where you insert the entire card rather than swipe, like the ones found at gas pumps. This is limited to certain [countries](http://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-pay-expanding-to-more-countries-665992/) and [banks](http://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00043884/997408820/Y/), though that list is constantly expanding.&gt- As an aside, whether you're purchasing a phone or simply activating Samsung Pay for the first time, Samsung occasionally has awesome rewards or rebates. Check out [Samsung Promotions](http://promo.samsungpromotions.com/) to see if you're eligible for any.* [Nova Launcher Prime ($4.99)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher.prime&amphl=en) | There is a free version available, but in my opinion the premium version is well worth it. You only have to buy it once, and can install it on all future phones. Unlike an unrooted iOS phone, unrooted Android allows you to completely reskin your phone. A few useful features of Nova include but are not limited to:&gt- Gestures. You can declutter your homescreen very well. For example, in order to open the app drawer - where apps that you choose not to put on your homescreen live - you can set a gesture to simply swipe up anywhere on the homescreen. You can also double tap (or swipe up or down with one finger or two fingers...) to open Google Now or put your phone to sleep or any number of useful combinations.&gt- App Drawer/Folder Layout. You can change virtually all of the backgrounds, transition animations and so on. I have my app drawer in the style of white material cards with different folders to organize apps. I can go into specifics if you'd like.&gt- Icon Layout. As you may know, on Android you can organize your apps anywhere on the homescreen. Nova allows you to resize the icon grid, make icons larger or smaller, and many other customization options. You can also download completely new icon packs from the Play Store. I use Elta. Another useful icon feature is the ability to launch actions (the same ones you can do with gestures) from an icon by swiping up on the icon. To add this, just long press the icon &gt Edit &gt choose a swipe action. This also lets you change the app label or specific icon.* [Zooper Widget (Free/$2.99)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.zooper.zwfree&amphl=en) or alternatives I forgot the name of and I'll add soon | Create custom widgets. Android allows widgets on your homescreens, rather than just your notifications panel, and these apps let you completely make your own from scratch or, with Pro, modify templates from the Play Store or internet.  This lets you make custom clocks, weather widgets, calendar widgets and so on to place on your homescreen. [This is one of my homescreens](http://imgur.com/ArvdVYJ) the clock is a modified template from the Play Store, and the folder labels are also custom widgets.**Settings to Change*** S Note &amp Stylus | If you went with a Note 5, one of the main benefits is the stylus. For some reason, Samsung completely hampered the main stylus app, [S Note](http://www.samsung.com/uk/apps/mobile/snote/). Luckily, if somewhat un-intuitively, the features they removed are available for download. Open S Note &gt Click on More in the top right &gt Click More Features &gt Install, at minimum, the expansion pack. If you want to use the stylus effectively and have 15 minutes to spare, [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOUBsz8jRv8) goes over the relatively hidden features of S Note. There are plenty of other stylus settings you should play around with, from Air View shortcuts to keyboard settings. I kept the default Samsung keyboard because if I have the S Pen out, the keyboard defaults to a handwriting mode. Just don't put the stylus in backwards :)* Samsung Themes | Go to your phone's settings &gt Personal &gt Themes. While Nova (or another launcher like Action Launcher 3) reskins your homescreens/app drawer, TouchWiz still shines through in certain areas of your phone, like settings and notifications. These themes can slightly change those layouts/colors. If you don't want a new launcher, they can also change the entire look of the phone.* Other settings | Go through every single setting one by one. Disable things you don't need. Edit your quick settings bar. Personalize your phone, because unlike on iOS that's actually possible!
Are you using it as a hotspot?
Thanks! I'll try those links. I understood what Dual sim meant, just confused why if they're offering a version with Dual sim that they'd offer a single sim version. Wondered whether there was a benefit to not having the dual sim version, considering I'm likely to only be using a single sim?
The cable the phone came with is apparently not consistent in providing enough amperage for fast charging. I bought two new cables of different makes on Amazon for ~$5 a piece to see if that fixes it. (I hear the charger adapter is fine, just the cord needs replacing.)
The camera is good on the Note? Is it better than the iphones camera? My S5 takes...okay... pictures, but it's never been the same since I had to replace the lens. :\ I mainly want the note for the stylus, I like the idea of insta-notes.
Yup..you pair them with nfc
I just can't put a case on a beautiful piece of hardware like my Note 5. That just feels wrong. Therefore, I accept that I may have to pay the $175 insurance deductible some day. I'm okay with that risk.But that doesn't mean I don't feel for OP or anyone else who suffers this fate :(
Yeah that makes sense. At what point do you plan to cut your loss and cancel insurance if you haven't broken your phone?
You mean screen time on? If that's what you mean, I usually get between 4 to 6 hours. It varies on the usage.
Fantastic links! Thank you. Just the kind of thing I was looking for. My Note 5 is still out for delivery and should be here very soon! Can't wait to do a comparison test. I probably listen to four hours of music through my Note 4 every night.
I remember being able to hold down on the message area and a pop up would appear asking which keyboard I wanted to use. 
I'm not sure I have any interest in Samsung Pay, I mean, we already have Google wallet/ Android pay/ PayPal/ and so on. But yeah_unlocking the bootloader voids Knox, which in turn voids Samsung Pay.
I went from using iPhone for years to using the Note 3. It was such an upgrade, I don't know how I didn't make the jump sooner. I am now getting my Note 5 in the mail tomorrow and I can't wait.
The app worked great for about 99% of my albums, thanks!Gonna try different things for the rest. 
Right now, I understand that rooting your Note 5 will permanently disable Samsung Pay (even if you flash back to stock, because you've tripped Knox and now your phone is considered insecure). Having come from years of running CyanogenMod on phones, I personally plan to not root in Note 5 or muck around with ROMs, but  that's because. circumstances have changed. Also, it feels like stock software is needed to get the most out of this hardware (camera, S Pen, magnetic strip emulator, etc) 
The imessage video quality is the only issue I have with my Note 5, but everything else I like so much better than iphone I won't go back for that one advantage.  I just email videos instead, or post them to a dropbox or youtube... and tell my apple peeps to email me videos instead of texting them.
Google Now works better than Siri for a lot of things...  and S Voice can set alarms and timers and other things without opening the phone or even touching it.
Google doesn't allow those kind of ads for any app in the Google Play Store so likely you installed something causing it. 
EVERYONE IS GONNA CHECK IF THEY'RE S PEN IS STUCK NOW
Where do you find the pedometer?  I checked my widgets and do not see one... *Edit* Never mind...I didn't have walking turned on.  I've got it now. 
Thanks, I have that too but it just turns off HD Voice and doesn't actually force me to go to 3G. I guess it's something I can't control and is just one of those things. Oh well. 
So it's stuck in the depressed position?   I'd play around with it and see if it unsticks. You can buy a replacement S-Pen for under $15 on AliExpress if you can't get it working. I'm still curious as to what would cause this and whether anyone else has had this problem.
can you not use the tip of a knife to pry it out of the old device? as far as I know the spring mechanism does not lock the pen into the phone, it just makes it harder to get a handle on the end to pull it out.  but you should be able to use a knife.
It gets stuck in the pressed position. You need a lot of force to take it out. While using it I clicked the top a couple of times but wasn't abusive about it. Like you would with a pen. 
Sounds like the spring is dislodged or something. I've seen photos from a couple of people who broke their S-Pen and that dark part separates from the pen and the spring is located in there and comes out. You could try to fix it yourself by separating it checking spring and gluing it back together, or you could take it back to where you purchased it and see if they will give you a new phone. I don't think they would give you just the S-Pen. Otherwise you could contact Samsung directly and see if they will send you a replacement S-Pen.
My understanding is that the sealed back just makes it more complicated to swap batteries, rather than making it outright impossible. Is this not the case? Like maybe you won't want to pull it apart and put it back together daily but surely once or twice a year isn't a big deal?
Yeah I got a skinomi one also, bought it so it would arrive on launch day. I had horrible halo effect, I contacted them and they sent me another one. Still had issues, I messaged them again, not asking for another but to left them know they might need to check their design and they said that's it's because it's tempered glass and it will not fit around the round edges of the glass. So they offered to mail me just a traditional screen protector. My girlfriend has a zagg one and it has slight halo, but I will get it swapped and we will see if that works better 
You are indeed correct, but I should be able to do something as simple as switching a battery on my own, which with a sealed back is of course not possible, and I don't think too many people are too fond of paying for this, let alone knowing their precious perfectly sealed glass/aluminium back is going to be pried open by someone. Regardless of how experienced they are, it's an uneasy feeling.
Agreed. If they fix the Optimus UI lag and add themes like Sony and Samsung did I think a lot of people will be sold, even if their multi-window clone isn't half as good as the Note's.
Nope you're right. Video calling was BOH4. My bad
The change logs are so vague. The only thing I've noticed is that I have more RAM available than before. Before, my RAM usage would be at 85% and over. Now it stays at under 80%
Today's update fixed the stagefright issue for me. Prior to this update, I still had one vulnerability.
did u see my comment about fixing it?uninstall and reinstall and it goes back to normal ...until you turn the phone landscape while twitter is open, once u go back to portrait the tiny buttons are there and I can't get rid of them except for reinstalling
Maybe this will fix my slow Wi-Fi speeds (anyone else seeing slow Wi-Fi speeds?)
Yes it does. I called samsung pay customer care and they said it had nothing to do with them and follow up with the bank instead. I did get an email from the bank saying that the card has been added and will be available after a while. Fingers crossed. But the free offer won't be available on Verizon as of now it seems. 
Similar in price to buying on contract for 679 + samsung's promotion for $12off your payments
What did you use for your customization if you don't mind me asking? 
Why don't you try the text or email?
So I tried to replicate what I had on my S3 (CM 12.1 Android 5.1.1 lollipop rom)http://i.imgur.com/YKDXqbD.jpg I installed the Material Design from the theme store and I installed Nova Launcher. The Icons I'm using are mostly from Moonshine, but I use some icons from iRide UI
Okay, thanks for the response.  I don't charge it with the belt clip on but there is a small kick stand on the back of the case that adds a bit of depth to it.  Is there a charger you have that you could suggest that might be a bit more powerful?  I want one that is a stand.  If I can't find one I suppose I could make one.  Thanks for your time.
Just got an update. Will report back.
Yup, it's the update.
I wish I knew, its driving me crazy because there's times where it clearly says this is just WiFi 
I would keep a USB OTG for my nandroid but other than that I have kept an average of 7-11gb free out of 32. That is with 3 roms and maybe a movie loaded. Most if not all my music is streamed or pinned when I plan for long stints of no signal and a requirement to be entertained.To be fair my note4 never saw a micro sdcard and I am also on unlimited data under tmo. I am living on the edge by not keeping a nandroid. My mindset has been between TiBu, keeping the latest version of whatever rom I am using, and a kernel what do I need a nandroid for?
I believe it does that to indicate it's attempting to use the cell network to do location. Or receiving MMS
Ok I hope it is real glass and not plastic......... you see my galaxy s5 lens cover broke or cracked like yours I should say and I was a couple of minutes away from pressing the pay button on Amazon to purchase one of these  low priced lens covers that are abundant on Amazon  and ebay.  It was pointed out to me by people more knowledgeable than I that these plastic lens covers will distort the image and the light coming through it which will  affect your images. Because of this fact I chose to send my galaxy s5 into Samsung and paid $75 to have them repair it with an OEM  glass lens cover part.....not plastic. I noticed you said yours is OEM  and I guess everyone can have their own interpretation of what OEM means so I'm not sure what standards the vendor you purchased your part adheres to but I just wanted to point this out to you.  I wasn't aware of this until someone pointed it out to me so that's all I'm trying to do to you...... again I wish you the best and just wanted to share facts best of luck  !I  wish you the best !!!!   I do realize you are talking about a note 5 but the note 5 and the s5 have the same type of cover it may not be the same exact part but its the same principle and type....ie glass lens cover.
While not an interesting shot, the camera is capable.  
Tried the test and the pen works fine. It's just the detection when the pen is taken out that doesn't work :(
:( Seems like the pen isn't working. The pen should work right away there aren't batteries or anything to install.
I've read it's caused by FB Messenger.  The app store would confirm this, with all the reviews stating the same problem.
Thanks for sharing this, FB Messenger was the culprit for me as well, on both my S4 and S6. It must have been one of the updates because there was a point where I had Messenger without this issue happening. Also, since I actually like messenger and use it a lot I didn't uninstall..I just do a force stop on it, which is really which is quick and easy to do with Nova Launcher, and that stops the problem for days at least..it actually hasn't happened again on either phone since I've done that.
I'll be getting a Google Nexus next. Either the 6p or whatever us new when I make the switch. They're bloatware free phones running stock Android. Many, many times I've heard people say that the nexus is the best phone they've ever had.
Pretty much everything pink (bloatware apps) and crap that my carrier installed. Gps always on but just set to Gps only so there isn't severe battery drain. Only turn on my Bluetooth when needed. Screen brightness at 40%. That's about it really. Always clear your apps to reduce background running. Edit: Also Moboclean is fantastic. You can prevent apps from running in the background. No root required 
That's what I'm worried about.  Aside from the random reboots, the phone is flawless.  I really like it if they just fixed the phone I send them. 
To clarify - this gets rid of the bubble animation when locking the screen (without a lock screen). The animation is pretty damn slow.
I didn't notice when the glass first broke, since the dbrand skin over it made the damage less obvious. When I was taking a photo of a food item inside a refrigerator, there was a foggy effect, and I thought it was the refrigerator. The camera could still focus at this time. After removing the glass, the camera had trouble focusing, but there weren't many issues. Once I had a new piece of glass over the lens, the camera could focus properly, although I think it has to be farther away to focus. If anyone could tell me how close they could focus with the Note 5, I'd appreciate it.
Pull out pen, screen write, save.
By mentioning  that you used package disabler, did you also disable S-Voice? In the past, that was always the culprit from what I have always read.
I tried looking for that font in iFont but it doesn't show up
I have a Capital One MasterCard, I see MasterCard listed. Is there more to it than that? I know my Chase card isn't supported, even Android Pay doesn't support them. Ugh.
The bank must opt-in. MasterCard/Visa and Samsung pretty much have everything ready to go and Samsung isn't even charging fees like Apple, but the issuing bank must opt-in. If your bank isn't supported call them, send a secure message, tweet them, whatever, just make sure you request support for Samsung Pay. 
My charger was shit and wouldn't charge in fast charging too. It even would tell me charge with cable that came with phone bs lol. Once I replaced it 2 days ago it always charges in fast charge. I think Samsung shipped a bunch of bunk charging cables. 
Just call Capital One and see what they say. If they support Apple Pay and Android Pay, there shouldn't be any issue with supporting Samsung Pay. It's basically the same system from MasterCard/Visa that they use, and they would use the same employees to do the provisioning. The only issue could be if Apple is cutting deals to prevent some of these bank/providers from supporting Samsung Pay. Which is possible, but probably wouldn't benefit the banks/providers much, so I think that would be a dumb deal on the banks part. In any case, it may be a a few weeks before we have a better idea of who is jumping on board.   
Chase isn't even supporting Android Pay, so I'm not holding my breath. I have no idea about Samsung and Capital One though.
I think Chase has the idea that they can do their own mobile payments on Android and Barclays does too. I don't expect either of them to enable Samsung Pay support. I already sent a message to both stating that if they don't support Samsung pay in a reasonable time period, I'm closing my accounts with them. I wouldn't miss them much anyway.
Is anybody able to add the my best buy visa?
When I tweeted Capital One about Samsung Pay at the beginning of September, when the Beta had just started, they sent this response: Right now, we don't have any info to share regarding Samsung Pay, but when we do, we'll let everyone know! ^IPI'm going to keep tweeting them and other banks/providers who haven't committed in hopes that they will add support for SP. 
Sounds like a software thing not a hardware thing 
Yeah noble kernel is having issues now.  Had to install a different kernel on  my note 5 because I was having random reboots throughout the day -.-
I dont have a BoA near me. So getting a checking account through them is a little bit more difficult.
Damn, that spigen looks tight! I have the neo hybrid crystal and it's way thicker than I would like it to be. I was considering the ringke fusion but now I think the liquid crystal might be the go. Do you feel like it would give much drop protection? 
Yes, but it could be done with auto-focus too. I just found that the autofocus was pretty jumpy for macros.
It's been a long time since I ordered a Caseology case 
I've been using PowerAmp for about 4 years now and it's by far my favourite android player. It's really easy to use and it gives you full customisation over the equaliser so you can make your music sound just how you want it as well as making your music play louder from your phone's speaker. It also has full Musixmatch support so you can automatically get lyrics for your music
I'm just saying what my problem is. The default camera uses beauty effects even when all of the settings are off. I would go so far as to say the 'processed' photo looks way worse quality than the preview, hence my screenshot joke.
Ahh didn't know groove worked with note 5. I put my music on one drive specifically because it worked with Windows 1and saved SSD space that way
[Verus Crystal Bumper](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VN6NICC)Very grippy, clear case.
I do hope the 6.update will fix that 
Nova,  lollipop/Moonshine pack.  I think the theme is called 6.Marshmallow? 
I found the package and it is not ticked. Also found it in my App manager. Still can not find the actuall app to open and use.
I really can't recommend Otterbox enough. The most protective case I'VE used and the lifetime warranty can't be beat. The last 3 otterboxe cases I've bought for my last 3 phones have been replaced numerous times by Otterbox without me spending any more beyond the initial purchase.Question, however.... I find with the Note 5 Defender case that the Home button slot let's tons of dust in. Anyone know way to fix this, or is perhaps my case stretched and I need a new one?
I called around when I got my note 5. The closest thing they have in Canada Is if you buy a $20tablet on bell they credit you $20on your bill. Same value as the US promo but not as good. 
Ahh I went to the site and I see what you mean. I'd say you are kind of assed out since they are CDMA and I don't think the phones support both like say a nexus 6.
Metal is notorious for blocking signals coming in and out of a device, hency why we have plastic strips on the S6 devices, or the plastic bump on the new Nexus line.If you're using the metal plate/magnetic car dock combo, make sure you're not blocking the Qi/NFC area of the phone (closer to the middle). I keep my metal plate on the bottom + a thin case, and can confirm Samsung Pay works just fine in this setup.Worst case scenario is to move the metal plate towards the bottom of the phone and have everything still work.
There are people on XDA who are experiencing the same issues. Some are getting 'bootstrap failed' errors, random reboots and major system instability after taking the update. I think I remember one person lost wireless charging completely.
Crazy. You just described exactly what I did today with my screen protector. Unfortunately, my solution was order a new one because I think it totally messed up the adhesive. 
This. Also, you'll want to stay away from the cases that currently have a kickstand on the rear side. The magnets on the kickstand part interfere with the S-Pen writing in that area, causing the pen to skip over the area while writing. I know that cases made by Seidio and Platinum are known for this issue currently.
Kinda follows the trend of S6 as well, and notes does come to mind too.
That lock icon is not to unlock the phone. I have a Gear S and a bluetooth headset as my trusted devices. Only on needs to be connected, but even then i use the lock icon to make it so that others can't try to use my phone if I am asleep or have it on my desk.
I disabled the Facebook app and still seeing the battery just drain as I actively use the phone.
If you disable it it won't use battery like it is now. You could also try something like Greenify if you want to leave it on your phone 
This - has a fantastic drop rating and doesn't add much weight or size at all.  Plus I think it looks really nice, especially the Ash with a white Note 5.
Its not bulky - I'm extremely pleased with the case.  Its drop protection is amazing while adding negligible weight and bulk.  It is thicker on the back but nowhere near what an otterbox does to a phone.  Plus, the see through aspect is an amazing look with the tint and hex pattern.  My one issue is that it wraps onto the side bezels really close which makes it slightly more difficult to swipe a drawer out.
I've done the basics, disabled Facebook,  turned off location, and stopped WiFi scanning. It is still draining fast while I read or browse. Might be a bad phone, might not. My point is i should get 4-5 hours SOT without doing anything special. Since I can't, this phone is not worth it. Time to wait for something else to try.
Is it the Facebook app, though? Just giving you maybe another data point, I lose about 1% every 6 minutes when using the phone, and usually get about 5h sot in an average day. 
I've never ever had problems with Facebook using my battery that hardcore, even on my Note 5 that is completely stock. I use it about 50% of the time I use my phone, even uploading videos and pictures and it *never* shows up as one of the apps on the battery page whatsoever, or if it does, it's at 1%.
I don't, I've disabled lookout.  I do use the device for work but I'm an admin for Google apps and haven't seen anything blocking Smart Lock.  It's very strange.  I wonder if it's Knox or something weird on Samsung's end?
My Note 5 is actually getting slightly better reception than my Note 4. At home, I am able to make calls in areas where my Note 4 would fail or drop them. My Note 3 was with Verizon, so I can't make a fair comparison.At worse, the Note 5's reception should not be significantly worse than the previous versions.  I would like to think that you either have a bad phone or something is going on with ATT's signal in the area/house. It may not do much, but maybe a call to ATT is in order?
The blog says the camera being used is a Fujifilm X100S. 
What problems are you having? While it may be carrier related it may also be known bug. We're all here to help :-)
I had a firmware update a week or two ago nothing today. 
Just checked for a software update and just got it. Not sure what it is for, 
They are my photos. Check the Exif data - these are taken by the Note. The X100s is my 'real' camera. 
This is what I did - Wifi was constantly disconnecting. Been stable on 5GHz for awhile now. 
Did you use a computer to update the software or did you do it all through the phone, im having the same issue
Not that I agree (never used a 6p myself) but I think /u/icky_boo meant that the 6p takes better pictures without fussing with a pro mode
That's a negative post! But an honest one, so thank you. As for the S-pen I used it on my Note 3. Not as much as I would've liked, but from time to time it came in handy. I guess you're saying that I should go for the 6P over the Note 5 if I won't use the S-pen all that much? 
I'm getting much better battery than my LG G2 on CM12. With about medium use and a low brightness I can easily get 1.5-2 days from my phone.
&gt choetech 3 coil wireless chargerThanks for the suggestion! I ordered one.
Siri and (ortana are more personable but Now is typically smarter - I like (ortana as a nice mix of Now and Siri,
It's an awesome charger that runs circles around the Samsung brand name one. Samsung really needs to work on function over looks on their accessories. 
I saw some T-Mobile Note 5 users complaining about battery life.  Was there ever an update to address it or did everyone just turn VoLTE off?
I'm too happy worth stock performance. Seriously. I'd consider rooting in the future IF I lost considerable performance AND didn't lose and stock features. Otherwise,  no.
iphone texted, or iphone i-messaged?SMS (text), MMS (multimedia), and iMessage are all exclusionary.I'd either upload the video to youtube and share the link, or email the video.
https://aa.reddit.com/r/galaxynote5/comments/3lar86/battery_or_performance_issues_run_this_fix/
Try restarting it and if all else fails take it in and maybe it'll be covered by warranty!
I agree. Keep the updates coming. As long as it's not everyday, I'd rather they continually improve things. In the last, an update was usually only every 6 months or so for Android via our carriers.
I have a note 5 with a spigen neo hybrid case and have no issues with wireless charging. I don't use the Samsung wireless charger because frankly, it sucks. I have a choetech 3 coil wireless charger and it works awesome. The case offers just enough protection in my opinion without taking away too much from the look of the phone. 
It should work through almost any case, as long as the case isn't made of metal.
Only a minor quirk where scroll capture wasn't visible.   Changed back to default theme, saw it was there, used it, changed to High Tech theme - now once again there.Kinda strange.  Sidenote: No lag yet.  Not even when I had Hearthstone on it.  I only removed hearthstone mostly because of the size
How was that cap piece attached to the pen?  I assumed it was one piece of plastic...
Its hard to tell with my eyes, but it looks like there are two locking tabs which sit in slots inside the stylus. But it is plastic. I guess I could get some super glue or something. 
They sent me a message saying to go to a service center. Unfortunately there is none near me. 
try a differnty wall outlet, like at work or someone elses home. My fast charger is loose/barley plugged into the wall and still charges my phone fast 
You can still mail it to a service center, talk with a chat rep they can setup everything for you and they will even send you the shipping label.Edit: actually don't send it unless you're willing to pay a fee to replace it if they think you broke it on purpose or if you dropped it etc.
You need to make sure the charger is completely plugged in. I know what you're thinking, 'uh..but it is, but trust me, I had the same issue. If it doesn't say fast charging, its just regular charging. So, plug it back into your phone, but make sure you're pushing it all the way in, it may even click twice. I had a s6 and was having the same issue, researched and figured out this was the culprit. If this doesn't work, then you have a faulty phone. 
I've also heard that the charger must be plugged jn the correct direction into the wall. So if it doesn't work one way try flipping it around. (the part plugged into the wall not the phone :D)Your phone will say fast charging  when it's fast charging. Also make sure that the battery is at least below 80% when testing this out. If it's still not working bring it back to sprint with your charger and see what they say. Hopefully you're still within your return period or they can help you one way or another. 
What kind of screen filter are you talking about?
Funny that you mention the DS Nintendo just released Pokemon Shuffle which works awesomely well with the S-Pen!
An app called Screen Filter. It puts a black overlay over the entire screen with varying opacity with the purpose of dimming the screen beyond the manufacturer's intent. With LCDs, you get limited results as the back light takes a lot of prescience, but on LED screens with perfect blacks, it works perfectly :) 
Thanks. I'm going to be very honest (don't judge me), I am actually liking Touchwiz this time round!
Ahh I see. Thanks for the info, I'll test out a sim to see if it works.
AOSP and Exynos don't play well together. 
OTG cable here too, plus a wireless SD card reader. 
Yeah from the pic you posted it looked like you were complaining about only getting 6 hours on and no one knew the whole thing was screen on....
Good to hear. I'm gonna be case shopping again now that I know the case I got (Platinum) affects the S Pen with leaving dead spots over the magnet areas. Might opt for the clear Samsung, its very minimal. What cases did you end up going with?
Oh ok, so you're familiar with it, good. Over on XDA, there's a few really good discussions going on discussing variant's and what to disable vs maximum battery life and performance. 
Yeah the battery life is actually fairly good except for when something (system based, not a rouge app) just destroys the battery
When I got accepted, I had the same issue.  I had to open a ticket with the support team, and eventually they escalated it to another tier of support.  It took about 3 days, and then I was able to install the update as per the e-mail.
I've been a long time Nexus user, all the way back to the  Galaxy Nexus. It's never been a secret that  TouchWiz has added Jank to the Android experience. This time around its much less than before so the relative smoothness compared to last versions is good, but next to stock android it's not, well at least not before this last update. Other than that, there were reports that despite the  4GB of ram that TouchWiz was aggressively killing apps. Although that wasn't really a problem for me with the way I use the phone it does seem better when task switching.  Like they've shaved a few ms. It's a great phone overall and it would be perfect for me if I could run stock android on it but with a little tweaking I've been able to get the best of both worlds, I.e. Nova launcher and Material dark theme. 
Tripping Knox is strictly software. It shouldn't be a problem. 
thanks! it feels weird to be totally clueless about technology, i'm usually decent about PCs and stuff
yeah, sounds like we're having the same problem. Coincidentally, the power button on my second Note 5 was also sticky :-/ Looks like it will be Note number 4 for me tomorrow. 
You're being far too nice for being a random poster on the internet! 
OP, nobody here bothered to look at the link you posted.  They think you're talking about an unlocked and rooted bootloader, not a carrier unlocked device (which means you can use it with any service provider).  You're fine to buy this device and still be able to use Samsung Pay.  
Currently I am playing Hearthstone.Free to play and not necessarily free to win. As with most Blizzard games it has a large following, large funding, and is all around competitive.  Very very fun though.There is a bit of a grind for beginners if you don't pay but that's half the fun anyway.You also get a few free packs and card backs with galaxy gifts.You can buy everything in the game with in game gold you earn through victory and achievements. 
2) yes that's what I meant. I reduced the brightness and it seems to have resolved some portion of the problem. Thanks! 
I've tried everything to get this chrome tab out of multitasking. Cleared device cache, chrome cache, disabled chrome, uninstalled updates, restarted device, still an issue. Does anyone know how to fix this?
Are you using your fingers or the S Pen? It'll only register S Pen inputs in Air Command. 
Ive tried both but I figured it would be the pen. How am I supposed to do it specifically.
what carrier are you on? on tmobile it's under data settings, you click on an app and then restrict data
I understand that you may just have has a defective S-Pen. I'm just saying that I've seen videos of people clicking the heck out of it and from a wear and tear perspective that's not a good idea, especially doing it rapidly like most people seem inclined to do. It wasn't designed to be clicked rapidly. As far as the Ali-Express S-Pens go, I'd be willing to bet they are made at the same factory the OEM parts are, even if they aren't official OEM parts. I'm going to order one to see if there are any obvious differences.
I don't know too much about batteries. I don't want to use the micro usb cable from my Nexus 6 if it can damage my phone. I may go to the T Mobile store today and see if they'll swap out the cable.
I had the same issue. The end that plugged into the phone would also be fairly warm. No issues with another cable. 
Damn, I had just put on one of those $1tempered glass screen protectors too, hopefully if they replace the device it'll stick again.
I mean it could be something else.  It just doesn't seem like a problem with the software since not that many people are reporting it.
No High Volume Warning and Clear Defaults Disable. 
It's probably the charging cable that came with the phone. They're known for messing up. 
Happens to me on mobile data or wifi, different wifi networks and different bands as well. I'm on T-mobile. All I know so far is that going to the Music app and playing a song fixes it temporarily. It comes back eventually but can be fixed by playing a song, really strange.
Chrome is known to not work well with the Note 5 and other Galaxy phones.  I can't find links (don't have sources, sorry).  I disabled Chrome on my phone, and I've been using the Samsung browser as much as I can (sometimes use Opera, too). There is a support package (Chrome Samsung Support Library) in the Google Play Store that is supposed to help, but I  don't know that it actually does anything (since I don't have Chrome anymore).Of course, none of this might help you solve your issue.
I don't have an issue with battery drain on my phone. 
I had the Nexus 6 before getting the Note 5, and the only things I miss are the front facing speakers and being able to update as soon as a factory image is released.I've installed all my google apps and made the note similar to the stock feel of  the Nexus, plus Samsung Pay is awesome when you can pay in almost any terminal
This has been happening to me ever since I switched from my Note 4 for a Note 5 on T-mobile. It's driving me insane. All other notifications work properly, but Kik just intermittently decides to stop notifications at some point until I relaunch the app. This is the first thread that I've found where people acknowledge having the same problem. I also am not running in power saver mode. I was considering the possibility of the Lookout AV that comes with the extended warranty from T-mobile. That's just a shot in the dark though.
I got it fixed. Not sure how it turned on, but from the very first screen, there was a button that said 'accessibility', and it didn't seem to matter if it was selected or not, it simply didn't want to turn off. I ended up struggling through the whole thing and turning off in the settings like the suggested earlier. Thanks for the help.
Still doesn't beat minehttp://i.imgur.com/coA1vm7.jpegNo packages disabled (don't even have it installed, don't see the point of owning this glorious phone then hamstringing it). 25% brightness and location off. Stayed in bed browsing reddit, WhatsApp, Facebook and Chrome. 
It's fine. It might tilt a bit when I hit  a bump  but generally i don't have issues. While in portrait obviously it stays straight up all the time. My dock is also close enough to the dash that the corner of the phone rests on the dash anyway. Obviously your mileage may vary. The dock you picked should work fine unless the magnet in it sucks.
You mean delete from the Google cloud I assume? If so, I'm pretty sure it can only be done by album on a computer. 
Can anyone provide a link on amazon for a cable that will work with the charging block ? My phone rarely fast charges I have to keep unplugging the cable alot of time before it finally fast charges 
Put your finger over the speaker?
Rawdogg for life. I do occasionally find the thin bezels annoying cause my hand-meat will touch the sides of the screen, though.
I only saw wifi or usb connection options on the widows app.  
I knew when I saw people going to town obsessively clicking the S-Pen on reviews that this was going to be a problem. Playing with that clicky mechanism is not the best idea since it puts unnecessary wear on a tiny mechanical device. Same thing will happen if you repeatedly click a regular pen. So far we've seen people putting their S-Pens in backwards, people inexplicably breaking their S-Pens in half, and now jamming their clicky mechinism. Where will this stop? Nostril and eye insertion injuries? To be honest, I'm not sure if this is a more of a design issue, user issue, but I suspect it's a combination of both. At this rate the Note 6 will have an imaginary S-Pen to prevent these kind of problems. BTW, replacements on AliExpress are less than $15. 
You need to download the package on Google play store as well. 
It was a problem with Snapchat. Tons of android users were experiencing problems across the board I believe.
Having never used a tempered glass screen protector, I have a question for you. What are the advantages of glass vs plastic ones or the wet application ones? I usually go with skinomi, what would be the benefit to using glass over something like that? 
You're right. Which is massively unfortunate. I've got a few other devices with 4GB of ram and it makes a *massive* difference, but not on my Note :(
Go into secure lock settings and then lock automatically. Set it to lock after 5 seconds. 
Just hover the pen and you'll get a bubble which after clicked will enable writing with the s pen
I went from the m8 to the note. Of course the speed is a big improvement but the most noticeable thing was the note screen absolutely blows away the m8 screen.i can easily read things while outside with the note.  Battery lasts longer than the m8 also.i listen to spotify/podcasts all day at work and check reddit facebook etc multiple times.not a power user by any means but it's 12:3and I have 40% battery left. I have regrets with upgrading. 
You could always get a battery pack, but that would mean having to carry a phone sized thing and a cable with u :(
Thanks for the reply. I think what you said - difference of color temperature - is what better describes my problem. I tried searching some more on XDA, and you're right - seems like a bunch of people are seeing issues like this with (S)AMOLED screens. Not sure if I will just learn to live with it or seek a return/replacement.
Got a replacement. Let's see how it goes with this one. 
I got the Note 5 to replace my Note 4 that was accidentally broken by my dad. I loved the Note 4.  I put it into an otterbox commuter, and never removed it. This means I never used the removable battery, or the SD expansion. With the Note 4, I got about 3-4 and a half hours on on screen time.The Note 5 is a really pretty phone, with the glass back and tiny besel. These things were immediately disregarded when I put a screen protector on it and shoved it in an UAG case, which will likely remain on the phone for the entire duration I will own it.The first thing I did as far as bloat goes is remove facebook, milk, svoice, briefing, and all the random games that came installed on it. I haven't gotten around to disabling the verizon garbage yet.The battery life is absolutely amazing. I have gotten up to 6 hours of on screen time so far. I got 5 hours of screen time today playing a lot of Hearthstone, Final Fantasy Record Keeper, browsing using dolphin, and taking some pictures. I have a pitiful 250mb of data, so I always have wifi on. I usually make my wallpaper black, and turn off the pretty lock screen options, but I haven't gotten around that yet. I haven't even installed greenify yet!The phone has no lag. Switching between apps (I do notice it resets apps sometimes if I have a ton open) is instant. I never updated my Note 4 to lollipop, so the updated UI is very good looking. I downloaded one of the more popular free themes (mostly makes a lot of the UI dark colors), which is a pretty cool feature.I haven't really messed with the spen a whole lot (main use of it on my note 4 was playing baldur's gate 2, because the UI is way too small without a stylus), but the new option to write while the phone's screen is off is pretty useful. 
If you check the AT&ampT site most of their stores are sold out of the 64GB, too. 
They directed me towards the Autodesk people. I am currently waiting for their response on what is going on. I don't mind purchasing it from the play store...but it's free through the galaxy apps gifts.
I just went through hell trying to get a 64gb from Verizon. Finally ordered one in store from Best Buy after almost being sent an hour away to another location (didn't have it) and spending 2 hours in store. Nobody has it. Only available online for whatever reason. 
You won't get wifi calling, and possibly no VoLTE as well.
Thanks for the update. 
Maybe try taking better care of your cables. That's where you should start.
I have an s6 edge with back to note flashed on it and im in the same boat as you guys :P note 5 software is so good so im reluctant to go back to anything that is s6 based 
No dipshit, shafted out of a phone that I can use the way I want, because it's locked up in knox, and yeah this promotion sucks as well. Both due to verizon. But fuck me right? Where oh where would society be without professional interjectors such as yourself to remind everyone that you have an opinion, and its always more important than our own?
This is sadly true. BOA requires voice authorization for cards on Apple/Android/Samsung pay for fraud protection. They ask questions based on your credit history, and won't go through if you don't have any (thus also implementing an 18+ policy for what they call mobile walletsSource:  Called and failed because I am a 21 year old dumbass and answered the questions regarding credit stuff wrong. Will try again in 72 hours and post results...
I came from a 32GB G2. I'd never run out of space on it, so I opted for the 32GB model. Have some movies and music on it and everything I want installed and synced and I have a little over 12GB left. My photos are all synced with Google Photos without any hit on storage space, so I basically just over 12GB of free space.I was driving through the mountains last week and downloaded 4-5GB of music on Google Music (which was like 20+ albums) and then just cleared it all when I got home.
You use Hangouts to send video??? How???
While pretty much common knowledge, this method will trip Knox. If you care about Samsung pay, you might want to hold off (I didn't care, and this method works fine) 
Do they show up in the music app?  As in does just the widget have this problem or the entire app?
Technically yes, the Note 5 uses a Wolfson DAC whilst the Note 4 (US model) uses the stock snapdragon DAC. Though whether it sounds better will be up to you, I recommended that you go in store and give it a listen.
Have you done a power cycle? In addition, holding the volume down and power button for 1seconds will soft reset it, which may help as well. Soft resets don't affect user data its equivalent to a battery pull in a sense. 
Not really.  You didn't cycle the battery that many times you just plugged it in.
It is a Yootech tempered glass screen protector, in case that makes a difference.
Thanks. My Note 4 has a cracked screen and the AT&ampT insurance didn't give me any option but to get the Note 5 for $149 off contract as a deductible, so I'm just going to hope for the best. It's coming tomorrow. I'm always streaming Spotify in my back yard through my Sennheiser HD650s and am just hoping the Wolfson DAC is a little louder. I seriously am at 100% volume to get a decent output on the Note 4.
You will have to push that air out. I would use the microfiber cloth and a squeegee card. Just wrap the card in the cloth and push!! towards the home button so it'll escape out the edge near the button. I had a few bubbles myself after applying but I just pushed after I got tired of the card I used my thumb. My thumb worked the best lol. I am bubble and halo free! 
Ok. Was getting frustrated because I kept getting emails from AmEx to activate my card for Samsung Pay, but it never worked. 
Just switched back to Android with the Note 5 from an iPhone 6. I'm glad to be back. I just feel I have more control over my phone. It looks and performs the way I think it should. The battery life gets me through the day with no issues. I will throw it on a wireless charger I keep at work for a few mins while I get ready to go to the gym but that's just because the little wireless pad is a nice place to sit the phone. Touchwiz has come a long way my friend. It doesn't look as cartoony as it used too. Still bright but not in your face. I don't mind it as much as I once did. You can also change the theme of your phone. I haven't done that yet because I'm happy with it right out of the box. Discussed battery already.. updates. My Note 5 came out of the box and prompted me to update. Now that maybe the only one I see for a while but it was there lol. Give the Note 5 a chance. You'll be happy! The only concern I had with switching was freakin' iMessage. It's a nightmare. Go ahead and turn it and find my iphone OFF. Delete texts and send your friends new texts, make sure those texts turn green. If not your texts from all your iPhone friends will go into this iMessage server cloud never to be seen or read...ever lol. 
I have the supcase an i'm ok with it, i dont use the belt clip though. only complaint i have about it is that the headphone jack space is kinda tight. I have to use alittle force to get my headphones big round jack in.
Mines slightly darker on the left side, but just barely.  I think it's the nature of the beast with these screens. 
Not if you're planning on using Samsung Pay or other apps that detect root.
Just switched over to Textra from the default SMS / MMS app. A GREAT find and tip: In Settings, scroll down to MMS, MMS Settings. Enable 'T-Mobile WiFi Calling Fix' (for those on T-Mobile) as I was finding with the default SMS / MMS app and Textra, Groups Chats weren't sending and receiving properly and MMS attachments I'd send and/or receive while on WiFi weren't working (as I use WiFi calling capability).
Agreed. Pm me if you want and I'll give you my battle.net we are both new so we can have a few games if you want!
I was always confused about that, why save in game rather through the menu options..? Also isn't there a Google Drive backup somewhere in drastic? 
Check out my post in increasing battery life. It will just about double it.
Or as the user below explained the button touch wont work on a secure lock screen. Which I am using. Are you using a secure lock screen? It would be nice to get a confirmation that it doesn't work for others as well in this instance.
Can you give me a context of when this doesn't work? I have a secure lock screen and I have zero issues with the S Pen working in any situation. When I am on the lock screen and I pull it out, nothing happens, but I believe that is normal. 
I use an alcohol based cleaner and a microfiber cloth. Or my shirt, whichever is closest.I also generally use an air duster to clean out the charge port and s-pen bay.
How does the pressure amount I put in the pen change the thickness of the stroke? 
Shit. Now that I think about it, my phone has been gathering fingerprints at an accelerated rate. EDIT: I tested it, the coating is fine but I'll be sticking to misting non-alcohol cleaners and a microfiber cloth
Well..I factory reset it and installed only the apps I really really need, such as Snapchat, FB messenger, etc. Then I turned off location and use it only when I need to. I turned off Google Location reporting. I used package disabler pro and disabled bloatware that Sprint did not let me remove.Other than that, I couldn't do much without rooting my phone...
This is very similar to what I was wanting to do. Any chance you can post pictures? 
I don't really have anything else to take the pictures with. I'll see if I can borrow someones phone and get back with some pictures.
I bought package disabler and it helps. But cell standby is still gorging on my battery. 
I use case and a tempered glass screen protector.  It makes me nervous taking it out of the case to put it in the Gear VR.  There's no way in hell I'd go caseless.  Too expensive. Too slippery.  I love having a nice pretty, clean phone.   
I got [this](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CSJ50HY?psc=1&ampredirect=true&ampref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00) lens set a while ago and they're very professional feeling, actual metal and solid glass.

This exact thing happened to me. I ended up doing a warranty replacement on it. They had me send it in and a week after they received it I had another one. Mine came apart in my hand and the spring shot straight out so I couldn't put it back together myself. If it makes you feel better it was after about two months with heavy usage on the penEdit: Also about two weeks ago they were on back order and most carrier stores don't have them on hand because of the NA backorder issue with Samsung. I would say it wouldn't hurt to call Verizon and see if they have any (some are smart enough to keep the pens from returns unrelated to pen issues). Replacement under warranty (for the pen) was the only option given by Samsung. 
I use Samsung Pay and the fingerprint scanner quite a bit.The fingerprint scanner works 90% of the time on the first try, and the remaining 10% of the time on the 2nd try after I adjust my finger slightly. Overall it's quite good though, and even in the instances where I have to adjust my finger, it doesn't take more than a split second to unlock. I *never* unlock with my pin, it's fingerprint all the way.As far as Samsung Pay, that too works quite well. In many instances, if I already have my phone out at the store, I'll just use Samsung Pay instead of taking my wallet out. It works better than Android Pay as I can use it in places where NFC payments hasn't been enabled yet. I surprised a cashier yesterday who protested when I tapped my phone on the card reader, saying we don't accept phone payments. A few seconds later, the card reader read my phone, and the cashier jaw dropped.
Hm, not sure where can I update it? It's a system app/widget.
Also hoping for this feature!  The only way to take another is an arduous process (save the current note, press the power button to turn of the screen, reinsert the S Pen, then retract the S Pen again.... pretty bad if you ask me).

Depending on how strong the magnet mount is on the dash you can go without using the metal plate to the phone. I don't and it's pretty damn sturdy. I bought a no name brand magnetic mount off eBay and it's not as strong.
Try to do a system update before opening the Samsung Pay app. 
I use a plastic film (Zagg hd protector) for my device and the top of it, right where the Samsung logo is on my phone, the film started to peel and was pushed in. Interesting how this extremely thin film was effected by the gear vr I'd expect glass to be an even tighter fit.I also have a dbrand skin on the back tht could be affecting thickness. 
I bought the Zero Lemon case on Thursday and had it Friday afternoon (Thanks Amazon).I really liked the idea of an all day and maybe even two day battery life.My phone can usually make it until lunch or a few hours after.I think I am one of the few who uses Knox for work email. Work and personal texts, emails, and phone calls really eat the battery.I currently have an Otter box defender case. I really like it. NFC and wireless charging work with the case.I knew going in that NFC and wireless charging would not work with the Zero Lemon case.After a weekend with the Zero Lemon I plan to return the case.It turns out I'm usually close to either a wall charger, car charger, or my portable charger.The bulk of the case isn't much more than the otter box. The side buttons seem to be better on the Zero Lemon than on the otterbox. The side protection is a little thinner on the Zero Lemon also. Which is good for keeping your phone's width small. This is a negative for me. I rarely drop a phone but when I do, I want protection.I also didn't like how the battery/power supply was just kinda on the back of the phone. When you install the rubber around the battery and phone there are no rattles or noise but I just didn't like the way it was positioned. The Zerolemon is only 2oz heavier than the Otter box but it feels heavier in your hand.If you have limited access to a charger, I would recommend this case. I would recommend an Otter box and a portable charger also.
Yes, it's a skin from dbrand, I purchased it since I only wanted the back. If you want all of your phone covered, including the sides, then there's Slickwraps. I choose Mahogany wood for the back and camera piece (I took the camera piece off when the camera glass broke). I paid around 11$ (before shipping). I'm pretty satisfied with the skin, I think it looks better than the glass back, and also feels pretty nice.
They just had me send the pen, and a week later they sent a new pen.
There are solutions to the problem. YouTube tutorials, even. But the first solution would be to not put it in backwards in the first place. I'm baffled by how anyone could do that on accident. I've owned Note phones for years, use the pen daily, and never ever put the pen in the wrong way. I cannot help but think that the people who do this on accident are dangerously unobservant. I hope they don't drive cars or operate machinery. 
I was wondering when this would start happening.  The little arm for the sensor  seems so fragile.  
Ahh, makes sense. I just chatted with an AT&ampT chat rep who explained that he wasn't told that it'll come in more colors.Would you happen to know if the S6 edge was available in gold at launch in the US? I'm wondering if based on history the Note 5 will come in more colors later on, in which I will patiently wait.
I actually have no idea the only reason I know about the gold and silver is because my wife wanted the gold and it was explained to me that they only released in Europe. If you are willing to wait I suggest you do at lease for a bit until we learn if it will come or not. 
Material Dark. Free. As several others are using. It's sexy. 
It really is a beautiful phone...once I wipe off the fingerprints 
There is no voice over lte setting, just hd calling and everyone says to turn it *on* to save battery. I've disabled about 20packages and fiddled with every setting imaginable to stop the WiFi chip from cooking at full speed 24/7, to no avail. 
Mine sucks pretty good too. I'm gonna give it a week but I'm literally always using it (that's why I bought it, for work, I don't take days off) and I've tried tons of tricks and tips to extend the battery life. I've managed 12 whole hours with 6 hours SOT, but its so erratic it drives me crazy. 
Hey! I use a couple things for my videos (@zanebrooklyn on Instagram) and I've been using them for a couple years. The built in Vidor editor is no slouch actually can help insert different audio clips and do transitions and text overlays pretty well. I also use Vidstitch Pro. Pretty bare bones but gets the job done. I edit audio files in mp3cutter, usually. Have fun, and remember,  the SPen is your friend!ZEdit: A few examples of quick Instagram vids:https://instagram.com/p/7b305fAYLG/https://instagram.com/p/7u8Ij2AYKB/https://instagram.com/p/207a0YgYLA/
I just ordered it from amazon, I'll take a picture when it gets here next week. Also I'm pretty sure you can get a feel for how bulky or how slim it is off some videos on youtube reviewing the case.
Hey, you're the guy who gave me hell for trying to help another Redditor improve their battery life because you were sure the Note 5 was junk! I forgive you :-)
Use ultra saving mode if you don't plan to really use the phone except for texting and making calls. That's what I do when I'm at work or sleeping. If I use my phone for more than that I just turn off ultra save mode and turn it back on when I'm not going to use it.
yup. same problem. not too happy as I don't know when (or even IF) ATT will push the update.I had been beta testing Samsung Pay for the past few weeks and using it all the time - now that it's officially released it just stops working. Not a good sign - I don't really understand why Samsung Pay is so dependent on carrier updates. What specifically is the problem? (especially considering that I was using it just fine two days ago).I did a support chat with Samsung a few weeks ago for a similar problem but it didn't help and nobody knew shit ... so I'm not willing to go that route again, but you might give it a shot and update us.
What battery did you get? I have the Sony wireless portable charger/battery and it seems to have a pretty weak coil coverage. Doesn't work with one of my cases, and had to be absolutely perfectly aligned for another. Works just fine with no case

They are actually Lithium ion polymer. True Lithium Polymer is not used in phones. Lithium ion Polymer refers to the pouch they sit in.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_polymer_battery
I get an average of 3.5 hours of screen on time over a 19 hour day. Not the best, but not the worst. And for rooting, there's actually an OEM unlock option in the developer options that will get to root and the xda forums have custom recoveries already working for the phone. 
do you find yourself constantly charging it? Or does it have decent standby time when you aren't using it?by the way thank you for your response :)
Nobody will answer you. Forum topics on this all tell you to use package disabler and greenify or something, clearly oblivious to the stupid Knox bullshit that Samsung has baked into the $80devices. If I wanted a pretty device that stonewalled me from using it how I want and didn't function how I needed it to I'd have bought a fucking iPhone. 
I get about an hour extra than this guy usually around 43hours. That's with heavy usage. The phone charges very fast, like Very fast. If your in the car a lot you can also get a quick charger for the car. All and all its the best phone I've owned so far. You can't go wrong with it. But if you do get it make sure you get the 64gb until Samsung comes back to its senses and gives us back a micro SD card slot.. 
I love imessage it's the only thing that kept me with the iPhone.. If you've never used an android phone before your probably not going to like it at first. There is a lot to learn. The bloat wear for example all needs to get turned off when you first get the phone. It slows done the phone and you get annoying pop-ups in the status bar. But if you can live with that it's the best phone I've ever owned and I'm coming from an iPhone 6. Oh and it's the best screen on any device period. Hands down. 
I've read to do that so many times.  Unfortunately,  on Veizon, there is no option to do so.  At least, it is not in my network settings that I've seen.
I wish there was a solid scale for what heavy use means. I'm mostly on Periscope, Snapchat, Youtube, Instagram, and Reddit throughout the day which seem to destroy my battery faster than if I'm just using the phone with the screen on for 5 hours even though I feel like I don't do as much as a heavy users would. l would love to get closer to 4.5 hours of SOT, but maybe usage patterns change the possible max life we can get out of these phones these days.
I just thought it was a bug at first and wasn't effecting the battery life.  Then I started to pay attention to how much it would drain while I wasn't using it.  At night, 6 to 8 hours while sleeping, I am losing close to 12%.  
If I'm sitting at my desk at work, I'll charge it while i'm processing files and doing whatever, but I tend to leave it off the charger until it get to around 30%. and if I can't at that time, I throw it in Ultra Power Saving Mode until I get home or to a starbuck where I can be a douche on my ipad and charging my phone. 
What would you say for you is heavy usage? :)also thank you so much for chiming in! :D
You should look at the detail screen and see the health of your signal throughout the night. 
I moved to the note 5 from a nexus 5 and while I can't really comment on battery life (only had it a couple of days, seems like about 4 1/2 hours sot is about the mark) I will say that by installing Nova and material theme from the Samsung theme store the experience is very close to that of stock Android (at least to me). The build quality is fantastic and the design is beautiful! Easily the best phone I've ever owned. 
My t-mobile variant has WiFi calling,but think sprint is the only other company that uses that feature. 
I tried giving the LUVVITT a try after my JETTech cracked (after dropping my phone). I wasn't completely satisfied with the JETTech since it had the halo effect. So far the LUVVITT doesn't have the halo effect but it also seems narrower than the JETTech. It seems like it doesn't completely cover the display, which is why I think there's no halo effect.  I suppose I prefer this over having the halo effect.
No, not WiFi calling-- The SIP client that's part of stock Android. It's missing from the S6 but I'm trying to see if Samsung has yanked it out of the Note 5 as well. I've edited my post to clarify what I'm asking about. Thanks. :)
I get about 5-6 hours of screen on time over the course of a day. 
I say heavy usage because most of the time I'm watching YouTube videos and playing hearthstone which is a game. So playing a game and watching videos to me is considered heavy usage. For example, at work today I didn't really have much to do so for most of the day I played hearthstone and watched stupid how it's made videos on YouTube about frozen fruit.... Fun times lol.. Np! Glad I could help. 
I think that's because you are using data intensive apps. Are you on WiFi most of the time because if not it would make sense why those apps eat through battery.
Hey dunno if you still care about this whole album art not showing up in my Note 5 business but I just realized something. After looking at the files on my computer and the same files I copy/pasted on my phone's music folder...it turns out that only the folder and it's mp3's were copied, not the jpg album cover file. How weird is that? Why would it do that?Anyway after copy pasting the jpgs manually for all the missing albums and especially thanks to the app you provided, everything's fine now. Thanks. I become obsessed over the smallest things sometimes...ah well. 
I've rooted every Android phone I've ever owned that I could root... except this one.I can't find a good reason time anymore.  No longer a need to hack system files to allow FolderSync to write to my external SD card like I had to do with my S5 (before the update that allowed external SD card write with explicit permission anyway)... Greenify now works for most things without root well enough (and Package Disabled takes care of the things it won't handle)... I never really got into the whole Xposed thing so no loss there... and I stopped tweaking for performance in the S4 days after a few too many late nights restoring from a backup when I screwed things up... and I haven't really had a need or desire to install a custom ROM since the S3.The only thing I would consider still rooting for is the app (I forget the name) that lets you use your phone as a USB drive and can mount an image on, so that you can boot a PC off Hiren's or Knoppix or something like that, which is really convenient sometimes... but I've only needed to do that over the last probably two years maybe twice anyway... I'll just do it with a plain old USB stick instead.So for me, root no longer really serves any purpose for me, so no, not rooting... I think just the fact that I can easily take OTA's without hassle is worth it (except for having to enable anything disabled with Package Disabler, but it turns out that's only like two things anyway!)
Mine actually looked the same. I got a skin from Slickwraps that had a cut out for the flash/heart rate monitor which fixed (covered) that problem for me.
I figured it out today for my personal case. For me it was the new wallet-flip case I was using. One of my debit cards is NFC enabled and so every time I pressed the phone against the wallet space it would activate the sound. 
I'm on Sprint and tested it while on wifi and while on cellular.  And cant reproduce.  Any hints?  Have buds there and can give them a heads up.  
I'm so jealous of all of you with the gold Note 5. I LOVE my white note 5 but really wish sprint would have offered the gold or silver at the time I purchased my phone. 
idk it could have been, I can't locate the other piece of the pen though
A good one I use is Dashclock Widget! You can add/use the stock extensions that show the weather, and alarm clock along with the time!
Are you talking about mobile data connection?
When you went back to the default theme, was the scrolling a lot smoother? I had a theme on my note day one and I notice that when scrolling around on Google now it lags a lot when things start to load. I'm wondering if you notice smoother scrolling when you switched back. Also I notice that the keyboard would have lag spikes that comes and goes 
Thanks for your reply! I purchased the 32gb golden Note 5 earlier today.It's unavailable in my country (the Netherlands), so I'll have to wait for it to arrive, but I already can't wait! 
Yeah thats what I mean I set my phone to vibrate only. I dont need it to make a noise because Either my wrist will vibrate or I will feel the phone vibrate.
Chances are if you don't have a nexus device you're waiting on marshmallow. 
I had the iPhone 6S Plus 128gb for two months and got bored of it. Purchased the note 5 a couple weeks ago and it's been great. A few things to note from my experience, the iPhones are great out of the box, a few small tweaks gives around 8-1hours screen on time in my experience and insane standby times are expected from this phone (1% drop over 8 hour sleep cycle is the norm)Having that experience I knew going into the note 5 would require some tweaking to achieve similar results. Package disabled pro helps a lot and also allowing the note 5 to do its auto optimise helped a lot. I'm reaching about 4-6 hours screen on time and stand by around 2hours now. I just want to echo that I feel the same way about Apple as a company and its recent decisions with its products. They still make wonderful products but I'm finding it difficult to swallow the hefty price now, the law of diminishing return has hit me. After 6 years of iPhones it's time for something new...The only thing I miss about iPhone is the App Store and more importantly alien blue it's actually a reason I want to get an iPad just so I have access to the App Store again. 
Is the stylus the big draw to buy the Note 5 for you? If it's NOT I'd wait for the S7 to drop. You're likely looking at September for the N6.
I think someone mentioned an app called Easy Home I believe that allows the finger print scanner to work without clicking button. Maybe that combined with another app can do the job 
So I went ahead and purchased two both usb cable that is 24/28.  One was called Hi-Mobiler, http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TF9DR4S?ie=UTF8&ampref_=de_a_smtd&ampshowDetailTechData=1#technical-data , the other one is called Gshine, http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0142TTMXU?psc=1&ampredirect=true&ampref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s0.Even though the Hi-mobiler one advertised of compact usb head, it was still a little too big for the case I have.  It's non braided cable seem to have the right dimensions to fit the case so I thought it would be the same (guess not).  Gshine one worked out perfectly don't have accurate tools to measure current and voltage but accordingg to gsam app it was equivalent to oem cable.
im gettin the same thing, terrible wifi speedseven when i have NFC or blutooth on, wifi signals just dies
Speedtests are the same on all my devices. But the note 5 crawls when actually loading things. And it's like bad ping. I'll open a youtubw video and it'll havw the loading wheel for like 3seconds and then load the video perfectly in 1080p with no issues. 
Just hold the volume down button. It shouldn't make a noise
Upgraded from an S5. I've always wanted a Note and was really thinking about getting the Note 4 because of the removable battery and SD card slot, and since the Note 5 was coming out,  the Note 4 would be cheaper.   After some researching and doing some thinking, I realized that not once did I ever replace my battery with a fresh new one on my S5 and all I had on my removable 64gb SD card were movies,  some music,  pictures,  and a bunch of roms for emulators and some comics.  So I realized that 64gb would be enough for me.  I ended up choosing the Note 5 because of the awesome features it was coming with.   I pretty much strictly use my debit card to buy things so I really want to use NFC and MST (got accepted to try Samsung Pay Beta,  but like almost everyone else,  I don't have a a credit card they accept yet) .   The phone really does seem smaller but still the same screen size as the Note 4.  And the phone just looks beautiful and feels really nice holding it.   Of course,  since it's all glass,  I reluctantly had to get a case because I don't want to smash the glass. The camera is excellent and since I have kids that in one instant can do something funny,  that double tapping the home button to open the camera has allowed me to take many memorable pictures.   And the fast charging really is fast,  and although I received a wireless charger with my phone,  it doesn't work well,  but it's good to know that I have it for whenever I do get a working wireless charger. Overall,  I am very happy with this (expensive!) phone and would not change it. 
Had a Galaxy S5 last year and scrapped it because TouchWiz was shit so I got a Nexus 6. Picked up the Note 5 the week it came out and have been very impressed with TouchWiz so far! Especially after my SO got rid of some the bloat ware for me. Vanilla android was fun but it was almost overwhelming with options. I may switch to Nova Launcher just to try it out on the Note 5 but so far so good with TouchWiz! About the size, the Note 5 feels better to me even with a case. Don't get me wrong, the Nexus 6 was a gorgeous phone but was just too big and ran too hot. 
It's grippier than the glass, definitely. More importantly though, it feels fucking awesome, and it blends so well with the curved edge of the glass that you can't actually feel where it meets the metal. 
Having the same problem, albeit on my TMO Edge+.Has anyone found a fix yet? It's silly that my iPhone 6+ could play 60fps but not my S6...
Yes. SwiftKey. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.touchtype.swiftkeyIt also seems to lag less when I text people. I'm also using Textra for my SMS/MMS default app. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.textraThey both have a great Material UI and I use the free dark Material UI theme for my SwiftKey setup. http://m.imgur.com/OdiWpjg
While I use Textra, I tried using the stock messaging app to check this issue and I'm not having the same issue you are. I'm also using the stock keyboard.  
Yeah. I don't know... I've just been really happy with the way it just works, like everything else on TouchWiz. The dialer buttons had been made too small on the stock app it seemed. I've been a nexus fan for years but it's finally donned on me that Samsung has some real offerings when it comes to software. 
Go with note 4...any built in battery don't hold as much charge after sometime... Your more safer with changeable batteries... Plus extra storage an i use the ir blaster eveyday... They ain't much to the note 5 aside from software... Matter of fact it's been safe the note 5 is just a bigger s6... Which is already months old 
I had been thinking of it all along. And once they said 9/3 release for MotoX I thought perfect, that's 14 days after the Note 5 date, so I can try out both and be able to return the Note if I want. Then moto backed up, deleted the tweet, and made me sad. I absolutely love my Note 5,  I've had every flagship this year and swore off Samsung devices after the S6 battery/ram issues, but still thought I'd give the Note a chance. Sure happy I did, it's a great device. That being said, if the MotoX's camera is even 90% as good as the latest from Samsung and LG, it feels good in the hand, and gets good battery life, I'll probably pick one up because I'm a major sucker for Google's version of material design. 
You're comparing an object to a human being. I have never dropped my phone neither and never put a case on them but not everyone is as careful and bad lucks do occur. Also, $80may be a big deal to you but not to someone else. I have a 6 Plus and an Edge + because I can afford having more than one phone. My friend has an iPhone 4 since it got released because that's what he can afford. Consider factors outside of your current and personal situation before bashing on people man, honeslty.. 
Samsung Wireless charging
Wireless fast charging stayed at 29.5C until I stopped it 2minutes after being fully charged.My phone is currently plugged in and idling at 28.8C.Edit: I left cpu-z running overnight on the wireless fast charger, the phone stays at 29C indefinitely with the battery reporting full charge. 
Slippery,I returned within a week.  Protection is good however, but it was just as slick with or without the case.  
I hold in in front of my eye with flash on and take the pic with front facing camera.Edit. Rear camera. 
Something is keeping your device awake. Install something like better battery stats or GSAM, see if they point out anything. 
https://i.imgur.com/DH85Ctr.jpgI use Nova launcher myself, along with vintage icons. I've been pretty happy with this so far, although I'm not sure if it's exactly what you're looking for. 
Is that IU in the app screenshots? 
Do you have deep sleep problems? What's your SoT?
if you still have all of the pieces, a couple drops of superglue can probably fix it! (maybe post a picture of your broken pen if you need help figuring this out)Otherwise, BestBuy was useless as always when I was looking for one, I ended up just getting one from a third party on Amazon and it worked fine.
I've tried playing with other launchers but always end up going back to the ole touchwiz. 
Does it comea with the wall charger too?
The first thought that came to mind is UAG. I've got quite a few cases for my Note 5 and it's my go-to when I'm going to be doing something where protection is at a premium. However, if you need something waterproof, the UAG isn't going to do it for you. It's going to be excellent at protecting the phone from drops or rough conditions, but not from water.
1) wait a bit, normally spam power button or home button until it responds 2) i didnt really use the note 4 but the stylus feels good, for me a nice weight and is responsive 3) i had an s5 and the note 4 fingerprint was like that i think, MAJOR improvements as its similar to iphone's touch ID where you press it and dont swipe your finger 4) Well, you will get lots of fingerprints on the back as it is a glass back. Its probably better to buy a case for drop protection. Cases depend on whether you want a see-through or a hard back non clear case. Generally Ringke fusion or the verus high pro sheild 5) The screen size and quality is much better than others in the market - (Nexus 6P screens were made by samsung) and it feels like a more premium device. Screen size makes it perfect for watching youtube or other movies. Fast charging is a major advantage and the battery lasts me a whole day and if i need just that bit more for the night, fast charging has me.6) Not many disadvantages other than no SD card storage, No removable back and the phone gets a bit heavy when watching youtube videos in bed cause i lay down holding it above me. Its a good buy, but there is already speculation of a Samsung galaxy s7 which will launch later this year so its your choice whether to wait. :) 
Because those benchmark scores are entirely meaningless. 
Marshmallow update
Still amazed that this issue even ever came to be.  I mean, come on, inserting the S-pen into the Note 5 backwards.. I guess there are those people who would have to try.  Sure, maybe Samsung could have done something to prevent this before the original launch of the Note 5.  But still, a little common sense would tell you that there is only one way that the S-pen should be inserted.  lol
I know not everyone will get something out of this, but there's a lot of people out there that didn't know you could add multiple fingers to your fingerprint scanner.
I have it. It's a pretty good case. Not too bulky, good fit, nice stiff silicon bumper and good plastic button covers. I like that the back of the case keeps the nice curve of the back of the phone. The back is slick and prone to scratching if you put your phone in a pocket/bag with keys or other items. I also have a glass screen protector that's a little thick, so the lip around the screen is really thin, and I don't feel too comfortable putting my phone face down. Despite its downsides I still think it's one of the best clear cases on the market, second maybe only to the clear Spigen Hybrid case.
I think you just got a defective model.
Settings&gtSounds and Notification&gt LED Lights
It's probably one of those things that stands out to people who know what to look for, but not to others. Like, having a 4k OLED TV versus a 1080p LCD TV. A lot of people just couldn't see the difference between them side by side, whereas it was practically screaming at me. I've used both and the experience to me seemed similar, I probably just didn't know what to look for. 
I just use a black one. It looks cleaner and it saves battery, even if it is negligible. 
Settings &gt Apps &gt Scroll right to ALL &gt Scroll down to Google Search &amp or Google App &gt Select it &gt Force Stop &gt OK to any prompts &gt Clear CacheThen do this for any other app that is causing you issues and you should be fine.
That's really surprising, the difference between GearVR and Cardboard should have been extremely noticeable. Perhaps the Cardboard app you tried happened to be very efficiently optimized and running on a current-gen phone? Everyone I've talked to agrees that GearVR is leagues ahead of Cardboard (Or any other phone VR-viewer).I mean, it's not like your paying 199$ for a piece of plastic, there are electronics in there that it uses instead of the phones sensors.
I'm in Korea, so probably not a carrier you know. It has been on wifi and on network, but this is music on my phone, so it shouldn't be an issue.I played the same songs on my wife's phone tonight and there were no problems. It is weird.
He also indicates he has battery saving option turned on and I imagine he is also using the Ad Block as well. I have done both and have improved my battery from 1hrs of use to almost 24 hrs.  Best thing is you dont need root. 
I've noticed better standby battery life after updating
Na I mean a USB input, not output.
Have you noticed that by disabling bloat also removes the option under the phone's settings to see your battery use? You wouldn't happen to know which file handles that so I can reactivate it? 
Get a case or a skin. It is indeed slippery!And just my personal opinion: don't get a white one. I initially liked the white one but now I feel like it really emphasizes that the camera is sticking out that much. Seriously, the back looks ugly.
How is the software better?
Samsung agressively closing apps despite having 4GB RAM. 
I'll give you software but there is no way in hell the nexus 6 has a nicer screen than the note 5
Good review. I agree with a lot that was mentioned. If you're feeling a bit risky, try grabbing Package Disabler Pro from the Play Store and disable some of the services you don't plan on using. This app works on non-rooted devices and has been used by others with great success so far.
You don't happen to have a Gear VR, do you? A buddy and I were having issues similar to what you're describing and found that the Oculus app was staying active and would even restart itself when you force stopped it. We both used Package Disabler Pro to stop it and only reenable it when we're going to use the Gear VR and the battery life on both our Note 5's has improved a bunch. That being said, I find that if I don't restart the phone every couple of days, Android System always finds it's way to the top of the battery stats. I've gotten in the habit of restarting the phone every morning before leaving for work and it seems to help. It helps that the Note 5 (and S6 I had before it) restart in about 2seconds. I loved the 6P, but the one thing that annoyed me to no end was the minute and a half to two minute restart time. It felt like it took forever.
Passpoint hotspots are certified  and require authentication so aren't truly open networks.attwifi hotspots on the other hand can be anything with that name thus they are more easily spoofed. One would gather that passpoint wifi networks are safer than open networks.
Well Im mostly in wifi... While Im out i always have data on and i have horrible signal... Screen brightness at 40% (no auto)... Im using package disabler pro i disabled the list that is mentioned as basic at the forum... It isnt anything I use so idc... I have location and location history off,  android device manager off, i have bluetooth on only when i use my wireless speakers.. I use samsungs app optimizer for all the apps except the one i wanna receive notifications from and music( addicted spotify user)...I use facebook from browser... I use chrome beta...and swiftkey... Hmm i think thats all i do&gtHow did you obtain this? Do you have any tips? I'm struggling to get more than 2 or 2.5 SOT.
Don't disable the stock launcher and then put the phone in ultra power saving mode. Almost bricked my phone.
If I keep Wifi on, on my Verizon model, I lose approximately 5% overnight. That damn Wifi bug is the culprit. 
tldw - Clear data for the bluetooth app.
I have a lot of my apps like Facebook, Instagram, G+, etc restrict background data so they don't show notifications all day unless I open the app or connect to wifi then they all start coming thru. This may be what you're experiencing Edit: What app are you using for app optimization? 
Can you postva screenshot of your battery stats
Costwise it wont cost me anything, I'll be able to buy a Note 5 for the selling price of my 6S.The reason I switched back to iOS was mainly because of the fact that my whole eco-system consisted of Apple products. I had an iPad, iMac and a rMBP. Currently I have a PC, an Asus laptop and an iPad Mini.My 6S feels limited, both OS as storagewise. 16GB doesn't cut it for me (my phone is 99% full most of the time). I could always upgrade to a bigger storage iPhone, but pricewise I can't justify doing that. I know Apple is all about exclusivity, but lately I feel like they're just making stupid decisions. Examples being the iPad Pro Pencil charging, the iPhone charging case, the iPad cases being seperated into a front and a back case which means a big price increase.. All in all I'm just fed up with the way Apple is going as a company, and I'm slowly replacing all my Apple devices for other brand devices. I'm not saying my 6S is bad in any way btw. As a phone it's a lovely device. It does what you'd expect, it's fast, snappy, the camera is great, the screen looks ok and the battery is pretty nice aswell. But considering my opinion about Apple, the fact that iOS feels limited, my phone is always full and - something I haven't mentioned yet - I kinda miss a bigger screen, makes me want to switch back to Android, or at least a non-Apple phone.
There is a solution, something to do with sliding a piece of paper down and around the pen, which opens back up the latch mechanism.  
I have a note 5, its good but the lg g4 looks better considering removable battery and way cheaper price tag.
Without rooting I'm not aware of any way to change it.  It's baked into the touchwiz os skin.  You might be able to write an overlay scene in tasker or something that would present an are you sure message.   Honestly though, the easiest solution is to not hit the button, not sure if you can modify your behavior to achieve that wetware hack or not.  
If anything you can just go back to the original chrome tabs, where it's in the app rather than using the multitasking button.
Honestly the only things I do with my Note 5 are play games and browse the Internet. I hardly text or call. I also will hardly ever use data, WiFi is all I need. 
Thanks, doesn't happen too often but it's just bad design. that button at the bottom is so close to the home/switcher/back buttons. If they moved it to the top that would be so much better.
Do research into USB cables and get the best one.
High quality sampling? UHQ Upscaler ?
I'm using a 5.1.1 ATT Note5 and Samsung Pay is fine for me!
I have a T Mobile Note 5. With Package Disabler Pro, I clicked on disable all bloatware. It disabled Instagram, Facebook, and the photo editor. So I enabled those again. I also use Greenify a couple of times a day, and I'm getting anywhere between 6.5 and 7.5 SOT, depending on use and reception, which is great for me. Oh, and I disable touchwhiz and use Action Launcher as my launcher. Switching launchers, for reasons I can't understand, has also helped battery life.
Samsung has a 1yr warranty on parts and labour if there's no physical/water damage. Just give them a call and they will direct you to the nearest authorized repair shop.
Just be careful on what you disable, I've heard people bricking their phones when they disable some stuff by mistake. The safest way is just to choose disable all bloat from the app setting and then you enable the stuff you want from the bloat. 
Hmm that's pretty unusual, Have you tried taking the sim out?
So others don't have to watch the video: it creates dead spots for the SPen where the magnets are.
Older Sprint LTE phones including the Galaxy Note 3 had dual antennas, one CDMA and one LTE to deliver SV-LTE. Unfortunately Sprint had to abolish that system due to TD-LTE creating too much complexity with dual antenna designs. Sprint will be able to offer talk and surf at the same time when they eventually get VoLTE. AT&ampampT and T-Mobile offer talk and surf on both 3G and LTE, and Verizon offers it over LTE through their Advanced Calling 1.option. You have to enable it on MyVerizon but it is there.
I switched to the grey tip, because the black one was sticking to the plastic screen protector. I think the grey tip is harder.
Our neck of the woods has mad 4g lte speeds
I got mine and am happy with it but coming from an S5 and wanting a bigger phone here's the one surprising thing I learned:It's not really much bigger at all! I mean this beyond the GREAT job Samsung did making it feel not much bigger... the curves on the back, the thickness, the small bevels, all that makes it physically feel not that much bigger and that's the good part.The bad part though is that the screen is ACTUALLY not much bigger. I was surprised by this because I remember in the past when comparing the S series to the Note series, the difference seemed huge. That's just not the case anymore. There's barely any difference width wise and the height difference isn't huge. Truthfully, it's hard to tell the difference unless you put an S5 right on top of it like I did. But, here's where it doesn't even matter: Samsung increased the scaling, which means that you'll actually see a bit more content on the screen at any given time. That too isn't a huge difference, but you WILL notice it. It's nice :) Oh, and in case you haven't heard of PenGate: DO NOT put the pen in backwards, even a little! You'll very quickly and easily break your new toy. Google it if you haven't heard, it's kind of amazing and a big deal to many.
probably because it looks like 'notes' 
I have had every note except the 1st. Each one got better. And I'm a very heavy user. I even had ZeroLemon batteries for every one. I too was put off by the no sd-card and non removable battery. But it hasn't even bothered me.  I have a portable battery anyways.  And a SD OTG adapter if I need more space.  And let me tell you about the battery downgrade.... The OS on the 5 is tweak to consume less battery than the 4. Even right now I have the Note 4 and the Note 5 in my hands. And I can tell you that the 5 is much smoother and last longer than the 4. Now if I put a custom rom on the 4, it probably will get better battery life that the 5. But as soon as I slap a custom rom on the 5. It will run circles around a custom 4. So your opinion is noted... But worthless. 
2.5 hours with LTE switched on all day.
you have nothing disabled? and are just playing with the brightness only?
Are you using the adaptive fast charger that came with the phone? 
How much of a difference in battery did you notice after using package disabler? I tried the basic xml for a day and I did not see a noticeable difference. Android system still was second in my battery list. It was about over 14 perfect usage while screen was the top. 
Have you dropped it even just once and even only from a short distance?Trick question. Everyone has. Your battery has a bad connection after you did so.
Camera is decent,  but that picture... 
Here is a screenshot of the image as it should look and how it looks on my lockscreen with the overlay: http://imgur.com/xqZCUvnSee how the overlay dims/mutes the colors?
Same thing has been happening to me for a while now. I flashed a custom ROM (I flashed Hyperdrive, a non-Touchwiz ROM) to see if it were a Samsung software issue, but it still happens. Seeing this post confirms that it's not a carrier issue as I'm on Rogers, you're on Verizon and the other guy is on AT&ampT.I think that only leaves the phone itself.
You probably got a lemon honestly. My note 5 is smooth and has great battery life. Off the charger I lose 2 to 3% over night. During average use I get around 5 to 6 hours of SOT. 
I am just sad Netflix only has the cabin to watch in.I LOVE the videos you can watch on the moon, or as an ant, or in a huge cinema.
Damn, thank you for not using a let me google that for you link haha... Found [this video](https://youtu.be/2XhHFWs5iYM) 
http://www.markstoffels.com/New-Zealand/i-sXxK29V/0/O/DSC_4585.jpgA live wallpaper app called Muzei pulls photos like this one from r/earthporn and r/exposureporn and sets it as my wallpaper ever hour
Yeah. Never had a case, never will. Not sure why its such a wonderment for some. In fact I've never had a case on any phone, and have never even cracked a screen. All the way back to the HTC Hero days. I like phones the way they were designed. So I take care of them. Cases suck and are for the weak. 
Yup, I have the same delay.
Wow. I would never in a million years strip my phone so much just to gain a few more minutes of battery life. You don't need to do any of this to have great battery life. 
Jeez. That's excellent battery life! I'm lucky to get around 2-3 SOT with about 12-13 hours of the phone being on. If you could estimate, what is your standby drain? Mine's around 1.6-1.7%/hour, which sucks alot. :/  I was so frustrated with my battery life that I did a factory reset, touched absolutely nothing, logged into my 3 Gmail accounts, and updated all apps preinstalled on the phone. And over night, I still got the same idle drain rate. One more thing: Could you post screenshots for Android OS? I'm curious to see how long Android OS stays awake for you. I don't understand why it's staying awake for so long for me! 
When the S Pen is removed, go to the bottom left 'gear' icon for the S Pen settings. Turn off Detach S Pen to turn on. Going forward, just click the button on the side of the pen when detached to bring up S Pen quick settings. 
Wow these are really awesome pictures, great photos! Even aside from the comparison I really like these pictures.. 
People are experiencing this on all different OEM's. I had both a nexus 5 and 6 and SMS lags on google keyboard regardless, the hangout thread is almost lagless-its the app- not the phone. Hopefully will be fixed (not next update) but following
yeah, no idea when they will release it. It will probably be expensive. I rather wait for zerolemon's. 
I haven't seen the material design theme, I like it
Any idea how Apple Pay works but not Android Pay or Google Wallet? They both use NFC.
Upon receiving the promo code and opting for the wireless charger, how do you choose either the black or white model? Or is there a choice?
?  This isn't apple pay  (which also uses nfc) this is Samsung pay which doesn't use nfc. 
I know, but the terminal says it accepts Apple Pay, so then wouldn't it also be able to accept Android Pay, Google Wallet, or the NFC part of Samsung Pay? (Samsung pay is both NFC and MST)
I've got the 64 and I would have paid for a 128 if they had it. I'm still not bought into the keep it all in the cloud mantra at all, I like having almost everything locally. I've got my 2,00or so songs, about 5eBooks, maybe a dozen movies, a bunch of smaller videos, family photos, and every ROM for older systems (think Atari, Colecovision, etc.), plus right around 40apps installed (yeah, seriously!)... and I've still got just a hair under 10Gb free for my camera needs and whatever else comes up.But, the thing is, I DID have to actually cut some things out to make it all fit with some headroom left... I've got MOST of the apps installed that I'd want, but I had to cut down my music collection by roughly half, and there's some videos I'd prefer to have on me, and a bunch of smaller stuff like more eBooks and whatnot.That's why I think 128 would be MORE than what I need, but 64, while I made it work, is really a bit too small... interestingly, I had 96 in my S5 (32 base and a 64 card) and that allowed me to have EVERYTHING with me and still left me a little over 10Gb free, so I really would ideally like to live between the model I have and the model that doesn't exist, but I'd take the 128 unicorn and be happy :)I think I'm quickly becoming the anomaly though, the person that doesn't want to just hoist it all up into the cloud.  But, it's where I'm at.
The beta only supports actual bank cards, but at this point, it works much better and of course has the benefit of being compatible with almost any POS system. It also ties directly into the phone, so accessing it is simple and easy and works seamlessly.I like that Android Pay has all my gift cards and loyalty cards in it, but I do remember at some point Samsung Pay would also offer the same functionality.
No downside really. If you disable something you use then yeah something might not work. However if you use one of his XML files nothing will be disabled that will break the phone in any way. On top of his I went through and re-enabled a few he turned off that i still wanted as well as ending a few more that he hadn't. If you disable something and it stops working its as easy as going back into the app and unchecking the box that turned that item off. The affects are immediate and do not require a restart.There is a reenable everything option.  I even have touchwiz completely disabled. Seriously, the amount of battery you get from doing this cant be under stated. Close to at least double. Like I said when I first got my phone Remaining time on a full charge was 1to 12 hrs. Today I am currently showing 1 day and 6 hours and its already been unplugged for 5 hours. Keep in mind these figures do not include screen on time but still. 
Judging by the picture, you can hook the silver ring that goes around the middle of the body of the drive. 
And even the camera point is arguable. For video though, Samsung easily beats the g4.
To be quite honest, stock android sucks. It's devoid of features, and full of errors. That lockdown bypass bug? Tried it on my note and it didn't happen. Different strokes for different folks. 
I switched from my htc one m8 to a note 5 yesterday. I was perfectly happy with my m8, but my mic stopped work and people couldn't hear me unless I was on speaker phone, so I was kinda forced into an upgrade. Its a great phone, nothing to complain about, but my htc m8, which I got on launch day was running perfect. I unlocked it and was running gpe edition. Not in love with the new phone, but a great upgrade. does not feel like its an inch bigger. and the screen is great. and the Camera is incomparable. all that being said, If i could just have a working mic, I'd save my money and wait a couple more months for something newer.If you need to do an upgrade. this is definitely the phone to get.
Right now the Gear VR is in a kind of consumer available beta stage, aka Innovator Edition, and Samsung stated that they plan on doing a full retail version in 2016. It's rumored that this retail version is going to have compatibility with all Samsung phones that support VR, and be adjustable to support future phones.Wish I could find my source on this, but I remember it being somewhat obscure, like a European consumer electronics expo or maybe one in Korea. Samsung was very careful not to make any promises or cause a news story, it was just a side conversation with a reporter or something like that.
Check your trusted devices. I noticed this too, and it turned out to be my Pebble watch. I didn't pay attention when pairing and setting it up and added it to Trusted Devices. Turns out the trusted devices feature is if a trusted device is connected, don't lock the phone ever. It's supposed to be a convenience thing, like if your phone is in range of your watch, of course it can be unsecured. In reality, this is a pretty terrible security practice, and really easy to gloss over when setting things up.
Yes, turn off all your phones features, and voila!  You get all sorts of battery life!
If you've only had it for two weeks, take it to the store and get a replacement.  Not sure about the clock thing, but S-Pen and music app could be a problem.  Why not get it replaced?
Try importing the pdf into S-Note, with what I described above.As for Write on PDF, it is an app that can be selected as the default app when you first open a pdf file. For me, I selected the Google PDF reader and was unable to bring up Write on PDF again. I have since installed the ES File Explorer app and it can ask you which app to use every time you open a PDF 
yep. i had a note 10.1, 10.1 2014, 500t, 700t, note 2, note 8 and this one... all had screen protectors just b/c of this issue. you can't be 100% sure that you don't have a piece of quartz stuck to your pen.
I don't think so, Sprint uses CDMA and T-Mobile uses GSM
Yes. This is exactly what I do. I use nova to make everything look like stock but I apply the material theme before I set nova as the default launcher so that my settings and messaging app and dialer and notification shade have the material accents.
I can live with the $3something a month that I pay in device financing but damn, a $30or $40screen replacement or repair just isn't worth it. Screen protectors and cases for me. 
Well the unlock screen allows you to open the camera. Are you looking to do it while the phone is already on?
That's bizarre, never seen a screen look like that 
I started the update and it was taking a long time so I left it to do its thing. When I woke up it was sitting on the Powered by Android screen with a bright blue light. I turned it off and back on and when it booted I had no cell or Wi-Fi. This screen shot was after I tried a factory reset.Guess I'll be taking it back today.
I pretty much just downloaded Package Disable Pro and clicked on disable all bloat in the settings. I unchecked a few option like Smart Manager which shows your battery stats in the settings and Samsung Account for Samsung Pay. But you can just disable the t-mobile apps in the application manager if you don't want to download the app. 
I had a similar issue after getting PDP, I don't know what I disabled but it tanked my battery life. I've since only disabled the most obvious unnecessary apps, Facebook, Milkmusic, sprint crap, Microsoft apps, and the like. I've had now power issues since.
This. Swap the cable and it will always fast charge.
My Verizon Note5 has a [Data Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Matrix) barcode sticker on the back of the phone (if you were holding the phone in the vertical portrait direction and were looking at the Home button and then turned the phone around to the left or right ski that it stays portrait, you'd now be looking at this sticker which is about the same height as the home button, but square).That barcode is a machine readable display of the [IMEI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mobile_Equipment_Identity)
As of now, there is no holistic option for device backup. There are various apps available, and I think Samsung's KIES program offers some sort of backup. If you're rooted with a custom recovery, you can make full device backups that way. 
I'm a righty but I hold the phone in my left hand most of the time. I think it's mostly because I put my keys in the right pocket and my phone in the left haha
This is an interesting observation as I haven't had a chance to discuss it much with other people. I initially had the same issue after transitioning from adaptive display. I think this is a perspective issue, after using basic ( I want to edit photos and them show up the same on other people's phones / displays ) if I switch to adaptive everything looks blue-ish like OP mentioned. So this may be a case of getting used to the display being adaptive or basic and then seeing the other as incorrect.
I have the Cali Case on my Note 5 right now as a matter of fact. It's the thinnest case I've used. So thin that you can't even have a skin on the back of your phone. I peeled off my dbrand skin (it was getting worn out anyways) and before that, the sides of the case wouldn't even sit properly on the phone because the added thickness of the skin pushed it back just that much. The feel and grip is great.
Q1 but they so there isn't going to be much change for the note. I think more so if you have nexus. I ain't worried. I don't want bugs, and a fucked up battery life like usually happens with those.
Nice, I've got the mahogany dbrand skin myself. The problem I seem to be running into is that without a case on the phone when you hold it the sides of my hand that are close to the screen,  touch the screen and it makes it difficult to use. 
Nevermind. The torch thing doesn't work in Wanam. I didn't bother with it initially because I just have the torch in my quick settings anyways.
Likley some background app with wake lock 
Just hold your thumb on the home button as you click it. 
Just install pie control from the play store
Have you used Samsung Pay yet?
I was looking for this option as well, I just switched from an S6. I use it most with phone number as I constantly switch between the normal Phone and VOIP app when I am in the state or abroad :( 
Sheesh dude. I have zero reason to lie. Stop trolling.I purchased [this](http://www.bestbuy.com/site/tech21-evo-wallet-case-for-samsung-galaxy-note-5-cell-phones-black/4319704.p?id=bb4319704&ampskuId=4319704) case from Best Buy the day I bought my Note 5 last month. I returned it a few days later, because the part that snaps onto the phone is too thick and the cut out for the S-pen is so small that it makes it impossible to get the S-pen out unless your fingers are the size of a child's.
Nova launcher to replace stock for me so far. 
I could see you using a skin with a thin clear case, but idk about an otterbox being over that
I usually turn SYNC off. I don't really need it on, I usually manually check emails, and when its time to back up my photos, apps and etc, I do it over wifi and usually over the weekend when I don't have to worry about my battery dying while I'm out.. With the Note 5 (T-mobile 64G) I rarely feel as though It will die.. off topic but I'm coming from the Note 4 on Verizon, I was always worried about my battery dying, 
I'm using BlackSky because of all of the UI elements being pure black,  and taking no battery
Yeah, looks like the s6 got the update too 
I rooted as soon as I got home with the phone. Mag stripes are going away sooner than later, so that feature of sPay is no biggie to me, and when you remove that, all you have is another app that supports tap2pay.I anticipate a fix for Android Pay to be coming down the pipe to work w/ root (remember, they removed the limitation on wallet), and when it does, I'll just use that.
Screen has been acting unresponsive for minutes at a stretch after update... Not sure if it's related but nothing else has changed...
I actually never use WiFI...  I guess that does make sense then. I'm already at 6.1GB only 12 days into my bill cycle and I'm sure 90% of that is those apps.
Wish T-Mo was better at documenting changes in updates. While the update text on the phone said Samsung Pay, their page says Various fixes and improvements https://support.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-23225
No, I'm not talking about VoLTE, I'm talking about SIP calling, like the kind offered on VOIP.ms. Thanks just the same for your reply. :)
Advanced calling in settings for Verizon.  However even with it off, I still get cell standby but not in the 20s, more often the 10s.  Some say that keeping wifi off can help this however it isn't a big enough impact on battery for me to warrant that.
FWIW the Edge+ is available in 64gb if you still want the form factor. And the battery life is a cut above the note too.
I've been using one for several weeks now, it does a great job of not making the phone feel too bulky.  Front to back it keeps the phone feeling thin, and it adds just enough around the edges to make the phone feel protected, without adding to much bulk.  Only minor complaint I have is that the S-pen is just a little bit harder to pull out of the slot.
having the same issue on Verizon Note 5. Supposedly it's a bug that is being fixed in the marshmallow update - I certainly hope so 
Is Advanced Calling VOLTE?  Because when I goto that, it says upgrade server to HD voice so I don't even have that to begin with to turn off.  
I am not even that upset about the battery life.  I did get the phone just over 7 hours of on screen time, but tried insanely hard to do that.  But that being at the top for seemingly no reason is annoying the shit out of me!
I'm using material, makes the transition from nexus easier. I'm sure I'll get bored and mix it up soon though. 
Well I'm hoping to use this next upgrade for another 4-5 years. A just in case feeling you know?
Package Disabler Pro actually has an option under the 3 dot menu called Disable All Bloatware.This is what I did, and it worked great for me.It's not permanent though don't worry, if you want one of the apps back, just uncheck it, and it's immediately back on the device.For getting messages from an iPhone, Samsung has a Smart Switch App:https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sec.android.easyMover&amphl=enI came from an iPhone as well and also had problems getting messages.Apple is annoying as fuck about this.I posted a thread and what I did here finally worked:https://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/3y7le5/have_done_everything_i_can_to_disable_imessage/
Google Play Services provides the location updates for most apps, as well as a number of other services.That is, it could be some other app requesting frequent location updates or frequent syncing with data stored in the Google cloud that is actually causing Play Services to use so much power.
Wifi &gt more &gt always allow scanning.  I don't have an advanced after more.
Apps are running just fine. I can speed scroll down Instagram and reddit with little to no lag and opening up apps isn't really lagging at all. The issue seems to be isolated with the home button. 
This is really bizzare, but this same exact thing happened to my phone at a similar time as yours (around noon on Thursday). Moderate use for a bit and then next time I looked at it, the physical buttons were unresponsive and the LED kept flashing blue every second. Tried every buttom combo under the sun on and off the charger but nothing changed. Had to take it to my provider's store to have it replaced. Insurance covered the costs, thankfully. Hope you've found a solution for your phone!
Just so I don't disappoint, I finally did... http://imgur.com/lIM3jV2Now that I have it, I can say that as a VR headset watching movies, it's stellar.  I haven't gotten a Bluetooth controller to go with it yet, but I'm really interested in gaming with it.
ohhhh... Security through obfuscation. You should work for IBM.I thought it was a lock screen and this was some sort of cryptic code to unlock.
There are quite a few waterproof cases available on EBay
Does long pressing on the notification not being up the standard menu to block notifications?
Thanks for the advice. I'll try your suggestions tomorrow. I'm not worried about tech support since I pay for device protection. So worst case scenario is they send me a replacement.
I use ifont. You can download the ttf font file from just about anywhere and put it in the font folder. And apply the font in settings. I have lato light as mine right now.
I have the same problem as well. I would randomly lose the ability to make calls or use data. However, my phone still shows bars. LTE shows the upload arrow steady but the download arrow isn't lit. Also on Verizon.
Apply a theme that skins the keyboard black.I use material black theme, although I would guess there is a free one somewhere in the theme store.
Go play in traffic.
Pluses speed, smoothness,  battery life, display, camera,  and finger print reader. Minuses glass back and no SD card. Future good Samsung Pay
Well, for me I just eject the S Pen and select whichever feature I want to use. Finger input won't work at all for Air Command and S Pen specific features, and you can't use the S Pen and your finger in conjunction. If your S Pen isn't being registered as a screen input, I would try restarting your Note and seeing if that works. Beyond that it might be a bigger issue that can't easily be fixed. Lemme know what happens!
I thought exactly all of that. In order to make sure it wasn't internet, I disabled internet and chrome at the same time, and the issue persisted  But its exactly what tabs look like in chrome when you choose the multi window tab view instead of regular tab view. It's essentially a rogue chrome tab that is stuck in the multi tasking view. When chrome is disabled, I can click on it and nothing happens. I can press and hold to pin it to the home screen and its just an outline of a box with nothing in it. I have no idea what the deal is. Super frustrating!
Just a thought - Nova Launcher will let you set a shortcut to go directly to the Data Usage screen where you can toggle data on and off easily. You can put it on your desktop or in the dock. I would use Tasker to toggle data on and off if there's a predicable pattern (time, location, etc) 
Voice over LTE.  Basically your calls don't switch the phone to HSPA.  
Looks like a bit of a double whammy here. You're still suffering the standby bug, but your Android System is outpacing your screen, which shouldn't be happening unless you never touch your phone. That would indicate that an app is also likely causing a wake lock on top of your other problem which will negatively affect your battery life as well.
Samsung has the battery case solved but no storage. I picked up a OTG SanDisk 64gb last week and its working great. I'm going to start my search for the battery case tomorrow as I seen it last night on the local market pages for only $75
Have you activated it within the S Health app?  
Interesting!  I noticed today it does display the correct media info on my car now whereas it didn't before.
They just released an update, but nothing, at least for us.
I've had mine for nearly 3 weeks. I'm on Verizon, and the battery life has been amazing. I've been averaging over a day on each charge. I love it.Just wanted to add that WiFi calling is off and I did disable most of bloatware.
Is there a card reader I could plug in for, say, music storage? New to android, sorry if this is an obvious question.
Build quality is excellent. Love the S pen, use it all the time. The display is amazing. The camera takes great shots. Performance is very smooth and fast. No lag issues. Battery life has also been great, over 24 hours. No real issues withe the Note 5. Highly recommend.
I don't see it in settings, in the main settings of S Health settings. I hope I am just not seeing it either. I miss it as well. 
Not really, no. I'm not an Apple fan so there's little chance I'd ever buy an iPhone and the screen and camera on the Note are so much better than anything else out there that it wasn't really a question for me. 
It in the samsung theme app
I have two samsung wireless chargers and both worked fine.  I did a large update all apps the other day and now I have the same issue as everyone else (charges for 3seconds, then get the blinking blue light and a Wireless Charging Paused message).  The charger is fine as I have tried other peoples phones with it.  Clearing cache, daydream, removing case do nothing and I am using OEM power brick.  it used to work.
Does the cable that the phone came with not have fast charging? because it only says cable charging when I plug it in.
No wireless is safe really, anyone in range can see your data with the right tools and auto connecting to strange wifi points doesn't sound like a safe bet.Probably it's fine but you take your chances.
Did you edit urself out of the picture? 
The Sensor in my GN5 never worked. The S-Pen fell out after less than a week and I've been without it ever since. Samsung didn't have any basis to believe my claims, but I never use it anyways. Good thing this was a free phone.
I downloaded another alarm app, and it uses the same sound files, and they also do not work. It's as if all the alarm sound files deleted themselves or something?
I had a flip, but gave up because the first time the dirt in your pocket gets caught between the flip cover and the screen, it will just ground in.  Gone with just a back cover now.
http://imgur.com/a/7NyfIThese stats are about two weeks old before I downloaded Package Disabler Pro, but now my Android OS/System went down by almost 50%  after I downloaded the app and cell standby time is usually 5-6%. I'll send you new screenshots by tonight or tomorrow to compare the stats. Also, Keep in mind that I was using wifi almost all the time during that time which might have helped my battery standby time a little. 
That's quite a story.  Why not go with a screen protector that doesn't require a wet application.  I have this one http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0134SKUJU?psc=1&ampredirect=true&ampref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00It does leave a little of the edge of screen exposed but with the screen being a little curved on the edges, it would not stick properly if it went to the edge. If you lived in the SF Bay Area, I can even offer to give you one of my spares.
I have the 920L so can't help you there. Someone over at android central forums just posted a pretty cool comparison of the firmware between the att model and 920L. http://forums.androidcentral.com/showthread.php?t=579396
My wife has a Note 4 SM-N916K  (snapdragon 81processor) and I have a Note 5. Funny thing is when your taking a picture in auto mode on the screen it looks ridiculously grainy and crappie before you snap the photo but once you look in your gallery it looks pretty clean with low noise. Mind you auto works for most situations well but manual is nice too. The manual controls of my G4 where much better though. Here's a small gallery for you to see. http://imgur.com/a/bIG6I
The SD card and battery things have been blown a bit out of proportion. I got the 64GB note 5 and don't plan on running out of space any time soon.The only thing I am still sore about is the fucking IR blaster I really hate that they removed it. With the IR blaster this phone would be worthy of having its name tattooed on my dick.
Phone size?
why so? i just thought that apps that were running in the background would use more battery life, then lets say a phone without apps running constantly? 
Verizon Note5 owner. Haven't dropped any calls. On the phone maybe 20-30mim a day off and on.
So doing an upgrade (2 year contract) on Sprint for $25for the Note 5 you wouldn't get anything right?  Leaning toward the 5X/6P but if they don't pan out I was hoping the Note5 would have dropped in price by then, they seem to be having pretty slow sales.
I keep reading about issues with the Verizon Note 5. The phone is usually off the charger at 235am, and I can barely make it a whole day with moderate use. I know the phone charges fast, but I had more life with the Note 4 or Droid Turbo (yes the turbo is not a good comparison).
This is my battery right now. I'll be somewhere around 5hr 10m SOT by the time it dies. This is basically my usage every day. http://1drv.ms/1LH9adGI tracked a 1.5hr hike today via S Health, spoke for 30mins, watched a bunch of YouTube videos and browsed a lot of reddit. Mostly on WiFi, Bluetooth off. You should ditch the Facebook app and browse via chrome itself (Facebook app has terrible wakelocks). Use Tasker to turn off WiFi when you're away from home. Disable location history (keep location services enable if you're disabling WiFi away from home). And, of course, use package disabler to turn off all the Samsung junk you don't need or use. See if that helps. 
The pre-registration is for iPhone users and if you trade one in you get an extra 10dollars in Google Play credits. Anyone just doing a standard lease can sign up beginning Sept 28th. I assume as long as you traded in an iPhone when you begin your lease, even if you weren't using it actively, they'd give you the extra 100.
I just ordered my 6splus, if I remember I'll update in a few weeks.
I wish I could uninstall the Facebook app, it came with the phone, and can only disable it. Ugh. 
That is definitely the next step. The odd thing is that my note 3 has always connected no problem, as well as friends phones. I've had hiccups on other networks with my 5, but always get it working fine after a few attempts to connect.
Don't allow it to use any background data. Or shit, if it's disabled, it shouldn't matter anyway. 
You probably disabled smart manager
The pen doesn't lock in. The click just makes it flush.  The phone can still slide out. 
Uh yes it does? The pen can't slide out.
People most likely don't see what you're talking about. Mine has the same problem and so does all of the Note 5 in all retail stores I've been to. The side of the phone has to curve and the pen is designed to be flat so yes there's a bit of a gappage and disalignement there. 
Yes it can, if the pen is loose, or it takes an impact.If the clicky part locked the pen in the phone, you shouldn't be able to slide the pen into the phone with the clicker down.
I use a magnetic, cradle-less mount by iMagnet.[$23 on their website](http://www.imagnetmount.com/), [$2and Prime-eligible on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/iMagnet-Cradle-less-Universal-Windshield-Dashboard/dp/B008IOQ3K6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&ampqid=1442861636&ampsr=8-1&ampkeywords=imagnet).Completely worth it in my opinion.  I have never had an issue with my phone (GS4) slipping off during a sharp turn, and the ability to hop in and out of the truck without having to mess with fucking clips and hooks and whatever else is priceless to me.Finger's crossed I can get it to work with the Note 5.  (And hopefully wireless charging.)
I m using moto360. Other than the occasional Android wear has crashed ,no other issues
I use https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.autowallpaper.free Then set it to auto change on Wi-Fi, and whatever subs you want.  Earthporn is a good one, but you can choose whatever you want
well if you're on AT&ampT or Verizon root isn't going to happen at all more than likely which is pretty sad.that wireless charging issue is weird tho. =/ hope mine doesn't do that.
Wow. If these are the themes that are approved, I can't imagine what they turn away. Actually I've have android phones long enough to not have to imagine. 
I'm using the official Samsung Charger. Don't have another charger to test at home but when I go to work I'll test it there and see if it does it at the Samsung station (work at Best Buy).
I have been through about 5 cases now, in the search that one. I am just like you OP in wanting thin, light but providing protection. This is where I am now and I think I am staying. I may just order different color designs  Galaxy Note 5 case , (Hard-Black) https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0138WX7LU/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_atwawbDG6FXRV. The case has very small lips around the screen and camera to prevent scratches and flat drops on clean surfaces. It's thin enough that the buttons almost stick out of the sides. It's a very open design so no button covers, etc.(Stick with the hard series, I think) As far as tempered glass, https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00U5Y63JS/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_9xwawbHP68BT1. I love this phone. 
I decided to take a picture with my laptop camera so it's not great quality but it's the best I could do without taking a mirror selfie haha.here you go! http://tinypic.com/r/2iqkakx/8
Running the debloat on the phone solved my battery issues. I can go from 5AM to 10PM on normal use with one charge now. 
I just need the ability to turn it off...I have no need to change my keyboard once it's set. If I do, I know where to do it in the settings
I noticed that my Note 5 didn't want to fit down into the micro USB male connector of the Smart Dock.  However, when you exert enough pressure it does overcome the 2 indentations of the connector of this dock (BTW, these indentations seem to be proprietary to the connector of this particular dock).  But unfortunately, once seated down all the way, the Smart Dock  does not seem to detect the phone as it does with my Note 2 and does not function.  Samsung must have purposely done this but I can't figure-out what the reason would be and why the Smart Dock will not work with the Note 5. Update:  apparently the Note 5 does not have MHL (mobile high-definition link) which of course would be required for the dock to work.  Too bad Samsung did not continue with this feature on their $85flagship phone!
This is very good news. I will be definitely be picking one of these up for only $99 to work with my S6 Edge+. I cant wait!
That's stock Android so I'm not sure how you would turn off that alert.
Could be, could be the songs don't declare album, etc.https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.citc.aagYou may want to try that
I don't know, I listed my case so folks could see the thickness if they needed.  It's pretty cheap though if it doesn't and Amazons return policy rocks.
What's that weather widget and icon pack?
Yeah sometimes the keyboard will freeze up for like 5 seconds at a time...
Still working with my polar m400.  Bluetooth would never reconnect after I got out of the phones range. Bow it works great.  Will keep you updated.  
This goes against everything I ever read about OLED screens, doesn't sound right to me. 
I'll factory reset as a last resort I guess. Any chance you know how to disable the long press home button feature. I disabled google search and now its using yahoo search.
Buying mine on payment I had to give up my unlimited data plan. How'd you work around that? They said there was no way to keep it unless I bought it outright, up front
1) Mine hasn't frozen yet.2) Better, it feels easier to write with.3) Worlds ahead. Works like the iphone's, much more accurate and no more stupid swiping.4) It's actually glass with aluminum sides. Definitely buy a case, the glass is fragile and the aluminum sides will get scuffed from drops. I'd recommend Case-mate or Ringke fusion if you want a clear one to show off the gold.5) It feels great to hold, Samsung kept the screen the same size as the note 4's but made it just a bit taller &amp slimmer which makes it a bit more pocketable as well. Camera quality is phenomenal. Screen-off memos are really convenient. The wireless charging rocks &amp battery life is amazing. It's overall a really great phone. 6) I sometimes miss the IR blaster &amp SD card, but the advantages far outweigh the few things it's missing.
Get a gear VR if you can. They are pretty sick. Even just watching Netflix or twitch with it is incredible. 
So I've only had my Note 5 for a week and I thought I lost my pen. I had the s pen alert active so I was disappointed that it didn't go off. However, upon closer inspection i noticed the pen was inside but a piece of it broke! I have no idea how it happened. Phone is new and not abused, no drops. It happened while the pen was inside the phone somehow and I haven't been able to locate the lost piece.Here is what's left: http://i.imgur.com/a4xdZDn.jpgSo my question is: has this happened to anyone else? Also do you think I'd have any luck with Verizon or samsung replacing it? Or should I just eat the $35 and order one from Amazon? Im just a little upset it broke already and don't want to buy a new pen and end up having that break too.
http://i.imgur.com/ygJYXd4.jpg / nova prime,  min icon pack,  weather timeline 
There wasn't a trick to it. I mean, I was friendly and very clear with the rep that we couldn't do anything if I lost my data. I also came in prepared and educated on what to expect, again thanks to /r/verizon.  I'm unsure how they forced you to change your agreement when they weren't subsidizing the phone?I think what might happen sometimes in that kind of environment is that there is some latitude in the tools, but maybe because of the shift or store supervisor the reps are forced to be more strict than they need to be. I wouldn't doubt that getting rid of unlimited data plans is the pet project of many aspiring wannabe middle-managers (shudder).I'm cynical about retail sales and corporate greed but I really think unlimited data will be back before too long. So I guess I'm naive too.
I came from a Nexus 6 and absolutely love this phone! I love Nova Launcher and have been able to tweak it to get around the annoying touchwiz and features of Samsung. But Don't get me wrong. Samsung easily has one of the best phones on the market right now in the Note 5. The camera is hands down amazing. I like that the phone is slimmer than the 6p. Also the benchmarks kill all other phones. I'm so happy I went with the Note 5 over the 6p. Cheers!
For some people yes.Mine would connect to bluetooth devices fine but sometimes it would randomly drop audio output to those bluetooth devices no matter what app I was using (Spotify, PocketCasts, Audible).
I'm using a Spigen Slim Armor case. It's fairly thin but has good protection with its two part design, a flexible TPU shell and a hard PC casing. It also has a kickstand on the back. I also use a Supershieldz tempered glass screen protector.
Spigen also makes great cases, although I'm unsure as to their more heavy duty ones interfering with wireless charging. From what I understand, the Samsung wireless charges are spotty, but there is an offbrand one that is supposed to be more reliable[link](http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NWMI07S?redirect=true&ampkeywords=wireless%20charger&ampqid=1451350554&ampref_=sr_1_4&amps=wireless&ampsr=1-4&amppldnSite=1)
so the battery gets better after a few days?
Completely agree, I have owned a Note 5 for 2 months and the battery life is awful, people here are trying to justify their purchase.  I uninstalled Facebook and use the site in Chrome with Chrome notifications enabled, and I have seen a big increase in battery life, i.e. I can go from 7am to 7pm off charge, which includes using the phone throughout the day, before it would be dead by 3pm.Hopefully Doze in 6.will fix the other battery drain issues.
Wallpaper and clockwidget?? 
What are you going through leading up to that?  I enter the info, it's accepted and I get a Terms of Service agreement.  It is unable to register after that.  Trying with an AMEX.
Here are the links from the video:[Samsung Pay_1.3.2116.apk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B38DazAKThlQYUZLc3JYU2JzZDg/view)[Samsung Pay Framework](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B38DazAKThlQZFhNQjRneGEyOGs/view)
That sounds pretty generic, but they already support Apple Pay and Android Pay, so I think Samsung Pay support is highly likely.
T-Mobile rooted with knox tripped here, too. The same exact thing happens to me.
It accepted my AMEX so you might be able to get a AMEX Serve card. They're prepaid. 
Nice! Yea, for the first few days, when I'd pull it out of my pocket, I would inadvertently hit the home button twice while grabbing it and the camera would open. Needless to say, I know how odd it seems at first heh.
But you still have to root the phone to custom roms, right? Which voids any chance at using Samsung pay in the future... It's a bummer deal
 I don't know if this is what you're talking about, but every time I have the keyboard up, if I swipe down from the top and look at my notifications there is the option to choose a different keyboard there. I don't know why they would put it in notifications though.
If you unroot, do you get Samsung Pay back, or is it permanently disabled once you root?
Yeah now you have to go into settings and then applications and there's a way to change the default there.
If you use the method where you unlock the bootloader to install TWRP or the like, it triggers an e-fuse in the phone which sPay is looking for. So it doesn't really matter if you are rooted or not once you use this method (there is a chance an exploit is found that resets the KNOX counter, but I wouldn't keep my hopes up).
experienced any lag so far? I'm wondering if this phone is worth the full price as it just seems so nice in all aspects, design, camera, display, features, etc
I don't understand. The names of the albums? 
Make sure you dont have the data combination setting on. It allows the phone to use wifi and cellular at the same time. 
The thinnest one is the official case from Samsung.  I use it, it doesn't provide a large amount of protection but enough for a light drop.http://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/cell-phones-accessories/EF-QN920CBEGUSedit: it also retains the curvature of the back of the phone 
Squaretrade. $99 for 2 years and they gave me a 40% coupon code when I called. I bought the two year warranty for 2 Note 5's for $118 total.
1) I don't see a data toggle on mine (AT&ampT) but I work around it by turning on airplane mode, then turning on wi-fi. You can turn on wifi while airplane mode is active.     2) I haven't noticed this on mine.     3) I use Zedge, HD Backgrounds, Tapet, and themes from the Samsung store.
Definitely fucked up my phone with this update. The screen becomes unresponsive every 1to 15 minutes of usage or less. Requires a hard reset. Wiped cache partition per Tmo support and didn't help. They said I should factory reset. Very annoyed by this.
I've had to stop using themes as Ultra Power Saving Mode reverts its to default and removes me wallpapers from the home screen and lock screen.  kinda sucks, but that mode really helps get through a couple days. 
COGUL_White. Matches the way I have my home screen setup. Screenshots here: https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxynote5/comments/3lqxvl/post_your_setup/cv8zuls
So the only thing I've noticed, which is an improvement by the way, is that pulling up from the bottom of the screen for Samsung pay while the screen is off is a lot better. Before, it was a hit or miss, and when it worked it was sluggish most of the time. With the update it works every time and it is a lot smoother now
It has better battery life over the edge?
This may be a stupid question...How did you get the CreamT klwp theme working? Are you rooted? I downloaded it but not sure how to apply it....EDIT: figured it out, had to install the Live Wallpaper Maker!
The wrong one judging by my fucking battery life
Here's mine. The dock has more icons by sliding the dock (nova dock settings) [homey](http://m.imgur.com/UnlEpEL)
I had the same problem. First uninstalled the FB Messenger app which resolved it for several days. The problem came back. Force quitting the Samsung Pay app didn't fix this for me until I ALSO uninstalled the software updates for that app. 
As a side note, the last couple of times I've dropped my phone (just a couple of feet, has a case and all is OK), my S-Pen pops out. The button doesn't get knocked. It made me smile like some like t was some kind of ejector seat as a safety precaution for the pilot :)
What? Root cloak allows you to use Samsung Pay? I thought Samsung Pay was tied to Knox being tripped. 
I get about 6 hours SOT with Doze and greenify with the Note 5
How long have you had the phone since getting your replacement? I'm having the same problem, but I don't want to bother getting a replacement if it's only going to fix the problem for a month or two.
If you're buying pre-owned...Make sure the S-pen wasn't inserted incorrectly (will stop detecting when pen is removed)
I'm an ex-iPhone guy so I need to have all my icons immediately accesible. No folders.http://imgur.com/JOwjeyl
Newer Sprint phones can't talk and text due to the fact that they only have one antenna
So basically like Samsung Doze per app, but based on last used time, rather than the device being still?So also, is there a way to get rid of this notification?
Ok let me go a little more in depth I got this phone off Craigslist (note 5) and the original carrier was us cellular and since us cellular is so behind in general the 4g on my phone is locked. I have Verizon wireless. I put my sim card in and it doesn't let me use my 4g and since my phone is limited to 3g I can't use my 4g but its locked and the person I bought it from said to change that I need to root it and change it but when I go to root it there are T-Mobile and at&ampt and Verizon and what not but there isnt one for us cellular and I am trying to look And allong with me not being able to use 4g I can't send video messages or pictures and I can't be in group messages with androids or iphones. I can't get group messages, vids, pics, or 4g I need HALP
* Many phones get slower there are a few reasons for this the main being apps however any device like this is also going too start to slow down over time due to fatigue to the silicone unless you always keep the device nice and cool. This is not as much an issue on larger computing devices due to more room for cooling gear. The short life-cycle of your average phone makes designing for anything past a couple years at this point a waste of effort.* There is a fair share of stuff pre-installed however it seems there are options to replace each component within the OS (I have not tried it yet except in a few cases like replacing SNote for OneNote)* Might not be worth all the trouble esp if you want to keep the pen, its does not appear that the OS is seriously gimped in any major way though I could be wrong.* Personally I like going for the note as it represents the latest generation with a few months of learned improvements and fixes that the edge and S might not get.* I did not switch from a 6p but from a similar level smart phone. Really I went for the note because lately I am using my tablet more like a laptop and more and more I want my phone to be a functional tablet. This seemed like the right way to go.
Already did it  I try android every couple years never overly impressed. This phone is the first one in a long time that impresses me. Already sold my 6 plus. The pen is amazing gives you a lot more flexibility to do stuff. I'd highly recommend to try it out and if you don't like it return it though of you are like me won't be returning. 
I went from the Note4 to the Note5 and the difference is enormous. The Note4 was giving me so many problems that i was considering not getting another Samsung altogether, but they really did a great job with this phone. It fits better in my hand and the design is beautiful. It has a smaller, non-removable battery but it lasts LONGER than my Note4 did. By the end of the day I'm only down to 50%. 
Dark Material Design from the theme store. Its the same as the Material design theme but darker and free. 
Thanks for the comment. I downloaded the update yesterday and wireless charging worked overnight, so maybe that's it. I hope it holds...
Well I play snes right now, earthbound.  I always play that one time whenever I get a new phone. On gba I'm playing Pok??mon fire red omega which I didn't even know existed.  Pretty neat.I also have final fantasy tactics app from the play store but I haven't sank much time into that.  
I'll tell you what would be really awesome: Getting an old military field phone from the 70's, hollowing it out, and creating an external battery case powered by D batteries!
Yeah, but you could put 6 or 8, hell, maybe even 1rechargeable D batteries in there, so that would de a lot of power, and then you could have a second set in the charger, ready to go, at the same time! I'm gonna need a cammo shoulder strap to carry it around!
But that would be bulky. If they had just removed the glass and put a removable case with wireless charging we would still be swapping out batteries! 
agreed, that magnetic mount changed the game for me as far as car mounts go. nothing has ever been better nor easier.
I love my note, but price point was a factor for me. I had a 2 year upgrade so I was able to get a  64gb note for 30dollars. a 64gb 6p is 55dollars.  Of course if you are buying it contract free the tables completely turn!I decided it was a better choice to get the more expensive phone at a cheaper price than the phone I really wanted. This is the first phone I have not had root on and it hasnt bothered me a bit, battery is a bit weak, but 15 minute charge will get you 20%
I got the note 5 for the S pen features. No other phone or. The market has them and none can compare to the usefulness of them. 
Yup. Did location and Bluetooth and I still had to swipe and use my fingerprint. Disabled it
Samsung is running a promo that gets you a free flip cover or wireless charger if you sign up for Samsung Pay by Oct 11. So whenever Verizon gets Samsung Pay (rumored to be in a week or 2) is when you can sign up. 
How did you get the 64gb for $300?  On Verizon that is selling for $400
6P has less ram and no wireless charging, no S pen, not as good camera, not as good screen (though both still excellent). Note 5 was a no brainer. Had the 6P had removable battery and microSD support, then I think it would have a very strong case.
Cool, thanks!  Hopefully Samsung extends that deadline if Verizon doesn't get SPay before the 11th!
Even better, if you have a card eligible to be used with Samsung pay, go to the announcements tab in the app and you can get a free wireless charging pad now through Oct 11
So I guess this is a bug.  Need to give Sammy a heads up.
Mine does that too. Did you ever get a replacement, and if so does it work better? 
For Nova Launcher and Package Disabler Pro, no root is required
I've noticed that when apps are installed they aren't put in alphabetical order in the app drawer. Not sure why, but it happens with me as well. 
Do you have any apps with the Accessibility permission? If so, try disabling that access and see if it improves.
If you're talking about the screen off memo, after you save a note and unlock your device. There should be a notification and if you tap it, it should open up the saved note (else you can open S Note, and should be under action memo). Use your pen and hold down the button, drag and select all the information you want to use, then let go off the button and you should be given a list of actions.
The article lost me at get an extra battery before you start rooting I'm gonna guess it's a copy and paste from an older phone. 
Weird right? its like the first 20% of the battery is completely useless.
Did you turn the phone off in the spaces where it went white or did it do it by itself? You could have a defective battery that might not be connected properly... Maybe a heat issue? I'd see if the problem persists and take it for a replacement but screenshot your battery every day so you have proof it wasn't a one time issue.
Yeah man I've had this problem for like 4 years now, went through different Android phones different texting apps and different carriers, never figured out a real solution other than SMS is an old technology that needs to be done with already.
Low brightness and certain features turned off. Also running non-cpu intensive tasks like web browsing or music. 
Package disabler pro is a app that doesn't need root to disable unwanted background appsIf that doesn't fix it then maybe you have a bad battery,  call Samsung or your carrier
Yup, though I don't think it would make a difference if I didn't since the fast charging is from the adapter.
Yup, that's what I do. Just post the picture to Instagram and it automatically uploads to whatever social media you set up on IFTTT.
No it isn't. If all you've done is change the icons of your apps they would literally tap one to find out.
Verizon tried charging it, I explained what I'd seen, showed them the photo, and they're overnighting me a replacement (overnight free because I have the insurance). So I'll be set, minus the loss of whatever wasn't backed up (mostly text messages, I think). I wish I'd encrypted it now - was planning to but never got around to it, so I guess now I have some passwords to change.
It supposedly fixes memory management issues which is huge and it also had doze which should help battery life. 
Thanks! Went with the brown to match the gold
The only reason I'm not rooting is waiting for Samsung pay to come... if it ever comes
I'm using the material dark theme from the Samsung theme store.
This is from a live stream I did at a theater during a orchestra's practicehttps://vid.me/Fm48The video seems to have trouble exposing for everything, audio sounds great.
Mine is also fine. clicks in nicely and the pen is a snug fit. must be a defect.
if this helps I had a POS iPhone 5 with about 4 hours battery too. AND the lock button broke in the first couple of weeks I had it. Bought the Note 5 a few weeks back and its the best phone I have owned. Plus dat battery life is sweet. 
My pen fits too, only the clicker that moves around a bit. I'm guessing it's the spring inside.
I have a magnet in between my phone and case for my car mount, this Samsung pay uses some kind of magnet technology does anyone know if this will effect that?
Well I guess one of my volume buttons might be more tactile than the power button but honestly they feel nearly identical. If it's readily noticeable it's probably a defect. 
They're going for about $4on Amazon.com. there shouldn't be a process to it, just wait for the replacement to arrive, and use it! This has happened to me a few times. Luckily, I haven't completely lost mine. I got a slim case this weekend and that seemed to stop the pen from unlatching in my pocket. Here's the Amazon link:Original Samsung Galaxy Note 5 S PEN for AT&ampT,Verizon,Sprint,T-Mobile US-Cellular (WHITE) ~ USA https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0149ZUSHQ/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_9KbawbFC0QVS6
Any Android watch should be fine, whether it's Samsung Gear, Moto 360, LG, Asus Zenwatch, etc.
I had Sidesync 4.working on my Win1last week. I was using it for a few hours.Today it stopped working and Im having the same problem as you. I Managed to get 3.working as well though but it doesnt sync with the app
It appears the wireless charging issue has been fixed. Its working for me now.
What wireless charger were you using and what was the problem?  
I actually went with the S6 first.  My wife upgraded that same day to the Note 4 and after a week I realized I was jealous.  I returned the S6 for the Note 4 knowing I would likely stick with it. I write as a hobby and loved the handwriting recognition the Note line offered.  But to answer your question,  the S6 did do a lot of things well that I also missed in the Note 4. LPDDR4 ram, the Exynos processor, amazing camera,  and a TouchWiz experience that didn't completely suck come to mind.  When I discovered the Note5 was basically an S6 with more ram and a stylus I waited for the first reviews to come out and bought one a few days later. Over the past month I've really grown to appreciate what Sammy did with the series. That's not to say I'm completely happy, just quite satisfied. Samsung Pay is very nice btw, even in beta form. 
To add:Slow Wi-Fibattery drains quick even when the screen is off (25% to 0% in 8 hours)RMAed it. Hopefully next one is better?
[Here](http://imgur.com/CJCgJAX.jpg) is a screenshot of my battery life timeline. I did not charge my phone at all. I keep my screen brightness pretty low because coming from a G2 I'm used to it. I was also on WiFi almost all day.
Put your router in a central area of your home and put one antenna facing up and the other at a 9degree angle. Also microwaves or cell phone signals will fuck with wi-fi routers. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UygPcBCFRrA) is a helpful video. Make sure you cover all your bases before you blame the phone for poos signal.
I see. Kind of surprising it turned out that people actually like the Note 5, after all the (pre)release hate.Just saying though, that with 5.1.1 my Note 4 really feels fresh again, so the camera, the form factor and wireless charge right now don't seem to be enough to make me switch.Thanks for your reply !
I'm a spec junkie.  On paper and in reality the Exynos 742is superior to the 808 processor in the G4. The G4 uses older ram tech as well with one gig less, same with the Moto X Pure 3rd gen thats just released.  My buddy bought the G4 and I will say that I think the quality of pictures on his phone edges out my Note5, but marginally and mainly in low light. You can't beat the value of the G4, Moto X, or even the Note 4 though. You get a lot of bang for your buck. But you don't get wireless charging baked in, a fingerprint scanner,  or 4gigs LPDDR4 ram, etc. There's always a trade off. Samsung Pay is also pretty sweet. It really does work at any terminal you can swipe your card at. I'd be very surprised if we don't see that tech in other manufactures soon. I also think the Note5 has the best display available and to me that's even more important than speed. My advice is going to a store and play with each phone for a bit,  leave,  read reviews, then  go back and play some more before deciding. Ask the sales person what phone they have. If it's one you're considering, ask to play with it. Phones in the store are always in demo mode and it's rough getting a feel for them in your hand with the damn security dongle they're attached to.
i use AZ screen recorder from the play store. Works like a charm.
I can't trust anything this link says. It tells me to make sure I have an extra battery for my note 5 because 1 battery isn't enough to finish the process. lol 2nd battery pfffft
What was your shutter speed at? Assuming near bulb. 
Because Samsung would require you to send the entire phone for warranty repair. I they inspect the phone first to see if the damage was caused by faulty manufacturing or parts of human error.  Then, they will let you know th results and if it will be covered under the warranty. 
Not super close, but zoom in and back up to get good macro photos
Simple case that covers a bit of the front and all of the sides and back. I took my phone off the case for like an minute and I dropped it, denting the top side. Once I was using a rather thin casing, the phone dropped onto the floor and scratched the bottom right where the s pen is. Since then, I switched to a rather thick camo casing, enclosing all the sides including a part of the front. 
When on the lock screen I pull the pen and I get the auto note app that opens. I can use the pen to write but across the top you have buttons such as save delete as well as a few others and they don't respond to pen touch. 
Interesting. I'm not entirely sure what would cause that. I checked it on mine and with a secure lockscreen (using Fingerprint authentication) I am able to use all of the present options on the screen in the auto note app. I would try restarting your device to see if that would fix it. 
Do you have to do anything special to use them or just simply touch it with the pen?Also, are you using touchwiz or a different launcher?
Just touch it with the S Pen. I've never had an issue with input recognition, ever.It has worked for me when I was using stock Touchwiz and it works for me now using Nova Launcher, even when Touchwiz is disabled. 
I have a tempered glass on the front. Spigen ultra hybrid case. Then a red carbon fibre dbrand on the back and it looks fantastic.dbrand make really great products, can't recommend them enough! 
So bad it won Android Central's phone if the year,  as well as MKBHD's phablet of the year. Quite terrible, really. 
it's not the way the wallpapers are set, and upping the contrast won't help. it's a transparent overlay that gets put there when you use a lock other than swipe.If you go into lockscreen settings and put it on swipe, you will see the overlay is not there.If someone has a way to remove this, I would be forever grateful.
Go into settings&gtmobile data and see if its set to CDMA LTE or something. I had this problem with mine
I have a ringtone that I've used for probably the past 1years.  I used to have a BlackBerry, and their ringtones were awful, so I wanted a phone sound that was loud and sounded like a real phone, not a hipster rotary phone.  I can always hear it, and I always know it's my phone ringing.
Was it in your pocket? If I take a big step my pen gets clicked by my jeans and pokes out. I could imagine that if I wasn't paying attention I could catch it on something or bend it.
Google Play Music is playing. A notification comes in. My Note 5 ducks volume to 0. Every other Android phone I've owned ducks volume to about 20%. What does the 6P do?
Hey - wanted to get back to you with new information!For those of you with Enterprise Device Management (e.g. phones locked down by your company for e.g. corporate email , forcing you to use a lock screen after a timeout of &ltx&gt mins), you won't be able to change your lcok method to Swipe to Unlock and change this setting (to No Unlock Effect)However... what's interesting is that if you disable your EDM (e.g. Airwatch or other software), change the above setting, then proceed to install your EDM software/email client setup, the setting still persists. Silly little Samsung thing.
Www.samsungpromotions.comI believe that if you have a Note 5 or S6, and you activate a credit/debit card that is compatible with Samsung Pay, and make one purchase with it, you qualify for the $20store credit.  As long as you email in your receipt for the phone. 
It gets hot when I'm charging it, no different than the 6+ I had before the note 5. Also no different than the edge + I was using for a few days. It never gets hot when I'm using it though. 
I noticed this as well. Same with pictures. Quality is scaled down. Use whatsapp. Does a good job of sending high resolution pics and videos 
I've got a Verizon GS6 Edge+ and it's the same story. I came from a 2014 Moto  and I was used to seeing Screen as the top battery drainer every day without fail. Since getting this new phone though, I have never seen that. I can't help but feel like if Android System wasn't hogging so much, I could be getting waaayyy bettery battery life. 
why?I love my note so fast in terms of computing but still some lag or smoothness issues, apple having the slower hardware but keeping it all streamless is something I miss.Haven't really had many reasons to use the pen, except shopping lists and did my time sheet once but that was difficult. I hope they refine it again next year so it could be a mini mouse cursor. Imagine being able to use photoshop or write clearly and concisely on an image for work. Some things are annoying I was hoping to have a different wallpaper (lockscreen and home) after standby but apps can only do homescreen.Ringtone choice should have the functionality to pick exact parts of songs. Camera is amazing but can always get better. Was taking pictures of a bug 3-4mm square and it had issues focusing.Also needs a lock screen-perspective like iphones, auto or portrait doesn't work for every app. When using portrait with some games it will still go to landscape. beautiful phone mines hidden away though and the speakers are ok louder than S5. I hope they bring back storage and dust/waterproofing next year just for safeness.
To be fair though you would never believe how fast this thing charges with the ohms charger. I have never seen a phone use the full 1.8 amps on gsam battery monitor. Went from 15 percent to 52 percent in 3minutes. I bet it would be even faster starting from a lower charge. It continued at the same pace going from 15 percent to 78 percent in an hour. All while using it with a high brightness and even a 1minute 1440p YouTube video. I just bought the 5, the 4 was not 10less and I am a sucker for this design. Honestly I believe it is objectively much prettier than the iPhone and possibly the prettiest phone ever.  Built in wireless is cool but not everything. I have a wireless charging car mount though and it is such a game changer to just but the phone in the grips and go. The SD card sucks, no argument. It does come with cloud storage which can be nice sometimes. I have a couple micro USB flash Drives that have totally solved the problem for me. A 32gb sdwas cheap and easy on my g3. But I think 64 was the max and using several 32gb SD cards was such a pain. Very easy swapping between flash drives.
Honestly they're both great phones. But samsung is more closed than apple is. iOS is easier to jailbreak than samsungs are to root. I don't even consider my note 5 android, it can't do any of the things my other androids could. Stock iOS vs samsung android is basically the same exact thing.If you don't need the s-pen then you can do much more on the iPhone than you can on any of samsungs devices without ruining warranty. And if you're like me, stuck with AT&ampT then you're screwed with Samsung because even if you are willing to void warranty you can't even root. Some say this is AT&ampTs fault, but other androids are on the market for AT&ampT that are easily rootable.  I'm sure both companies are at fault here. If I didn't need the s-pen, I'd get a nexus or go back to Apple. But no other phone does a stylus like the note 5, that's for sure. Edit-- and I'm pretty sure samsung will be out with their own OS pretty soon, tizen or whatever it's called. They have an in-house processor, similar to apples, and their version of Android is so much more closed than any other manufacturer it seems like they're basically there. And when/if that happens then all our current samsung phones will be dropped from getting anymore updates. That's my biggest fear with the phone. 
The LG guys are as bad of fan boys as iPhone guys. Seriously. I bought a g3 last Christmas and yesterday it started turning on and off incessantly no matter what I tried. And the few times it would stay on, the second it went to sleep it was dead and wouldn't turn on. And that was just the final nail in the coffin. The g3 had excellent specs 2nd only to the note 4, and had a better design for sure. The regular ips 2.5k display was a bit cheaper on battery though, and on top of that the gpu was very nice, for a 1080p phone, but really needed what the note had. My g3 was so picky on charging chords half the ones I got would only slow charge. I would spend 1to 2each on nice charge only chords and would work great for maybe a week. BTW I cannot believe how fast my note5 charges, 3minutes without using it will get you from 5 percent to 5or more. The most annoying trait was the headphone jack was such shit that every non 4-way plug (has mic and controls) that I would use would have it constantly pausing or playing or changing volume or opening some stupid fucking connection app that I saw a million times. And if you go to the g3 sub mostly you will just see a hundred pictures of beautiful places that probably were taken with a g3. Was a great camera but not this nice. Occasionally someone will mention these problems and everyone jumps in how it's not that big of a deal and it's worth it for the display and who needs more than an hour of battery life playing a 3rd game anyway?
so exactly the opposite of this sub :D? (par the pictures part)
It should last you a year now problem. I used my g3 as my only computing device for a year and the battery life never got any more unbearably pathetic than it was in the beginning 
Fair enough, thanks for the reply. I came from the Nexus 6 and I love the note more for a lot of different reasons, do I guess I don't mind trading the openness off android for good hardware and stability, which is partly why I think I wouldn't mind the iPhone that much after all. I'm learning to love the s pen but it's not quite indispensable for me yet. What makes it a must have for you?
Would be nice if you gave an update on this!My Note 5 is coming soon, and sound quality is incredibly important for me.
Once you're done with tweaking with phones everyday and just want a phone that works then yeah the note is getting close to being up there with apple. I remember when I bought the G1, and I use to say that if I was ever stuck somewhere and needed to have a dependable phone I'd stick with the iPhone. It's still true, they're less likely to crash since the operating system is fine tuned to the hardware. This is something that androids will never have since the specs can greatly vary but the OS will basically be the same. An android might look faster and higher spec on paper but an iPhone will still run faster since the OS is developed specifically for the hardware in mind. Same concept behind OS X. I'm a student and actually use it a lot to draw biological pathways or to summarize my notes and have an electronic copy on demand when I need it. I could type it up like I use to but nothing sticks as well as writing with a pen and this way I have the best of both worlds.  Also having access to all the colors I need really helps when drawing pathways and trying to keep organized.  Then there's also the quick memo that I can quickly write little things down during lecture on what I need to study more on. My goal everyday is to summarize each lecture onto one page on my phone, so far it's been working. Most people won't use the pen as much as I do, during my undergrad years I hardly used the Note 3 pen at all but that was a completely different device with what seemed like a different manufacturer. So for those people I'm not sure why they would choose the Note over the edge+.
Press and hold on the notification and see what options come up.If it's part of the Android System, I don't think you can get rid of it.
Yeah I was upset about the sd card and battery too but you know what?  I was poised off when I couldn't find a new car with a cassette player ten years ago too.  The battery life on this phone is excellent, as are the charging options, and all the lack of sd card means is more cloud storage which I needed to do anyway.  
What carrier are you buying from?   AT&ampT is great out of the I box once you disable their bloat.  T mobile users seem happy too.  Verizon people are complaining about a battery drain.
nooooo. I was talking about an actual case that is attached to the phone, both protective and an external battery case. That's just a external battery that you connect with a cord. 
May I see some pictures? Has the raised lip from the skin presented any problems when using the phone? 
Yeah I was looking for a Silver one also. Very irritating!
Yours looks pretty seamless to me. It's hard to tell but it looks like the top and bottom fit perfect. I can't see any part of the original glass back. The right side looks good. The last pic though, on the left side you can see the metal bezel disappears slightly near the bottom but I can't tell if that's from the skin overlapping onto the bezel or it's just the pic. Looks great though! Mine might look the same in pics but IRL I can see about 1mm of glass at the bottom of my skin and the right side slightly overlaps onto the metal.
It's in your settings for your keyboard. Mine periodically turns itself off too

Sync for Reddit!  Used to use Relay, but changed when I heard Sync was going to be on iOS.  I wanted to keep my redditing consistent between my phone and tablet.  I've also grown quite fond of Sync, but Relay is another excellent choice.
From what I remember, it was supposed to boost performance because Facebook was (allegedly) hogging system resources. I don't recall anything about battery life.
Press volume up or down. A volume slider with a gear symbol should appear. Hit the gear, are any of these sliders down? Sometimes different apps use different volume controls.. Only idea that I have
I just feel like the Note 5 is a large S6 with an S Pen. It's getting away from the power users that have always been attracted to the Note line. 
Speed test seems much better after update. This from inside my office, never got over 25 in many previous tries.http://imgur.com/Je3QP08
Everything that is touted is great.  Cons are the normal.  No IR Blaster, no SD.   I could care less about the battery.  I have a charger at work, and carry around a ps vita power charger cell, which works great, but to be honest, I've never had to use them yet.
Can't stand it.  too slippery.  Added a [BearMotion case](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0129X7IJG) to just give it a little bit of extra grip and that's all I needed.
Yeah same. The vibration is loud enough to hear any messages come through. Constantly check the thing anyway. Oh, and my moto36vibrates at me when I'm wearing it too
Go to your phone dial pad and type, star pound zero star pound.Hit Wacom test and try the pen. If it dosent work there it probably the pen or something on the motherboard gave out. 
I could be wrong but it was my understanding the the international version does not have the hardware necessary for Samsung pay (MST transmitter) :/
Figured it out, in case anyone ever comes across this on google.Holding volume down on reboot actually initiates safe mode. However, it wasn't doing that for me. After a factory reset through android device manager, it started working. But why?I had disabled a lot of samsung apps, including the launcher, to save bloat. It probably could not load past the point where it could not find a launcher.Hopefully this helps anyone if this ever (oddly) happens again.Your phone will probably be stuck in safe boot mode until you fix the button.
Hey!I have a Note 4, not a Note 5 (though I would love to have one), so take what I say with a grain of salt.1) I do not have a data toggle in my notification tray and when I tried to edit the tray, there was no option to add data toggle, so that might have been removed a while ago. (I also don't see this option on my s6)2) Do you mean your lock screen is brighter than you're home screen? If you have auto brightness on, it might just be taking it a second to adjust to the brightness? 3) My note 4 has a lock screen wallpaper from the camera and from a large picture of Assassins Creed Black flag that I really liked. As for my s6, both are just personal pictures. 
Haven't sent too many photos through hangouts,but I'm having an issue where some messages don't appear until I back out the message and go back in
Water damage looks like this.
How's the quality of the natural series for the leather? Does it come with any side pieces or just a single back piece? Would you be kind enough to post a picture? :)
1. There's a Mobile Data toggle on mine. Hit the edit button and see if it's hiding in there. Otherwise, your carrier might have removed the option. 2. No way around that on the lockscreen so far as I'm aware. 3. I use Muzei to mix up my wallpaper. Download the glim icon pack and it can cycle through a bunch of really nice wallpapers that come with the pack. 
Do you have a Note 5 or S6 Edge+? Those are the only phones eligible. I have a  Note 5 and got that error. Keep trying it will eventually come up, I think they're overwhelmed right now.
I was able to install and register on Verizon after the update. But when I click on the coupon code, I get device not eligible error message
I installed the OTA update, but I don't see a Samsung pay app anywhere. 
no go. I updated my phone, and then went into the galaxyessentials widget and search for samsung pay and it doesn't come up
The smart select function that pulls text from screen shots is a little less intuitive than in the Note 4 software (addon in s-note for the n5).GPS has improved.Speed is better.IF you root don't stick with Noble kernel, switch to arter (no reboot on calls)IF you root/trip knox you will lose access (as of right now) to Samsung Pay..A hand full of decent TW based ROMs, don't hold your breath for AOSP based roms (See Exynos)One thing I don't like and its probably just specific to my car make and model. My bluetooth no longer automatically connects to my car. I didnt have this issue with my Note 4 and other BT devices seem to work fine.
~~I don't want either of them. Don't like the case and I'm waiting for the fast wireless charger. [Here is my code.](http://m.imgur.com/Qavrswr) Be quick!~~Its been redeemed!
Try again! Last night, I was receiving a message that my device wasn't eligible but I tried it again about an hour ago. Was able to get my code.
Im pretty excited about this system. TBH if they can get enough banks on board I feel like the system they have blows all the others out the water. Being able to use it on any terminal regardless of NFC is brilliant IMHO.
Exactly why I want Samsung Pay. 
quality specs of camera
I change my battery after 18 months then upgrade at 2.5yrs... 5 years on one battery actually using the phone is fantasy.
I just got my Samsung Flip Wallet and love it so far. I didn't really feel like the S View cover offered any real utility anymore. I also found the Flip Wallet on Newegg for 18.99 plus free shipping which is by far the cheapest I've seen it. It only holds one card but I don't think I would really want a bunch of cards weighing my phone down all of the time anyway. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16875868114I also have the Ghostek Cloak which I got for free. Unfortunately, it was the version where the USB cable wouldn't fit through the opening. Other than that it is an excellent case and looks great on the Note. 
If you use the Spen then do not disable my My Script Resource Manager. This disables two features and it took me forever to figure out which disabled app was causing this... just don't disable it.
Samsung's Wireless Fast Charger is expensive for what it is, but man its awesome to top off my battery so quickly. 
Don't all modern smartphones have gorilla glass though? I had a screen protector for a while again on my S3 but I absolutely hated it, because I felt like the screen was less responsive.
Like I said my S3 is pretty much intact, and this phone has been with me for 3+ years... I just make sure not to put it in the same pocket as my keys, and not to use my nails on the screen etc. This is also after visiting the beach countless times with it, so if the Note 5 has the same sort of protection, I don't think I'll need a screen protector.
I had a carbon fiber but I think that this one has more grip :D
Perhaps I am not using Doze correctly but I have noticed little to no battery increase...
I've never had a case on mine and I don't plan to as I've never used cases for my phones.  I think the Note 5 feels great to hold, minus the small bezel which makes it easy to unintentionally touch the screen.  I've never really had problems with slipping because I usually hold my phone with my pinkey finger supporting the bottom.  Whether or not you should depends on you.  I feel confident going naked because I've never dropped a single one of my smartphones from any significant height.  Sure, accidents can happen at any time, but statistically, I'm comfortable enough to risk it.  I've always been hyper-aware of my phone - where it is and what it's doing and if anything could potentially cause it to fall or break.  In an event where something could cause it to fall or break (like falling out of my pocket while getting out of the car), I will always hold it in my hand or at least have a hand on it until the situation passes.It's just a matter of being careful.  I don't understand chronic phone-droppers (the ones who always have a crack on every phone they've ever had), because I would think after even one instance of dropping and breaking a several-hundred-dollar device, they would make a conscious effort to take care of it.
I have the flip wallet with a matte skin applied to the back of the phone. I'd previously posted a couple pictures of it here:  http://imgur.com/a/pI5jvI like it quite a lot, but you do have to change the way you hold the phone a bit to use it. 
Ahh, same. Did nothing for me, my problem also seems to effect local videos and streaming music services as well.
I didn't get the January security update still stuck with November one.This is still too early.
For the record I'm lurking this sub to make my decision on my next phone and I had this same problem on my Galaxy S4 and eventually did a factory reset for some other issues I was facing and that just so happened to fix the snapchat problem too. Two birds with one stone!
Have you changed the dpi of your device? Or have you been playing around in Package Disabler Pro?
There is no 128gb option. 
I would strongly urge against the N6. Coming from that phone, the note is a much more manageable size, the screen is light-years better (and you can actually see it outside), the camera is no competition, the build quality is much better, fingerprint sensor, I could go on... Oh yeah, and take this coming from a stock Android lover. Touchwiz is actually great once I changed themes and Launcher and debloated all the features it adds are actually really useful.
Hard reset?
Best one that I've used that doesn't give a halo effect is the Zagg HD Glass. Don't get the one from Best Buy, as that one has the UV blue light protection and is not cut right to prevent halo effects. Get the one from either the Verizon or AT&ampT carrier store. 
The cell standby bug occurs when WiFi is enabled. I don't understand why a cell radio would consume more battery when WiFi is enabled though. I'm very curious to know the basis of the bug as well. Apparently it's prominent across various devices running lolipop. 
There is a possibility that you have something running in the background that is chewing up how your phone performs perhaps? Is the issue of slowness everywhere or just connected to the Home button?
Last thing I can suggest is turn on all the services Package Disabler Pro disabled, uninstall it and then manually disable S-Voice from the applications menu within the settings. This is the only other way I can suggest to you. The home button lag always seems to be due to S-Voice as the culprit so maybe Package Disabler Pro did something it shouldn't so you need to reverse it and do it yourself, manually.
I have a nexus 6p and the ui lag on the note is bad. It comes and goes randomly. It happens the most when scrolling. The battery will settle in a day or two. But android system usage is higher than other phones and its is normal for the note it seem. 
It feels great naked,  but I've shattered too many screens to risk it. 
I am using an otterbox with the heavy silicone and hard back, does not appear to affect wireless charging at all. I have also used NFC for data transfer without issue.
Oh, I realize what you're trying to say. The ebay listing doesn't state the material. The part feels like glass and also gets cold like glass. The first time that I bought this, I didn't handle it carefully enough and two big cracks formed, then one corner broke off into little shards before I could even try putting it on. The item costed below 4$.The listing also states OEM for Note 5, but this doesn't look like the original, or focus as close as the original. I choose this because it was the only option for just the glass piece. If you could find the real part (just the glass), I'd see if I can use that.
Don't forget Beep'nGo. Uses phones sensors to send loyalty cards to scanners. Works every time, cashiers are always mind blown that it scans
Do any of these cases work with the wireless charging? 
The S pen doesn't care what's between it and the screen.Wacom uses electromagnetic resonance to power the stylus, so as long as the tip of the pen is within the magnetic field of the screen (&lt15mm or so), it'll work.You can test this yourself by hovering the pen over the screen in S-note and pushing on the tip with your finger. You'll see that the pen draws as if it's in contact with the screen.
Can Evernote be added to the pen action menu? 
I use it as a widget on the screen to the left of my [home screen and have SunRise widget on the right. ](http://imgur.com/a/KDBP2)
Thanks for the reply!Do you think or happen to know if a plastic screen protector would make then pen drag on the screen?
I own both a Choetech and A samsung fast wireless charger.  Two things- The Choetech has a larger sweet spot for charging and it takes up much less space.Oh yeah and It's half the cost too! 
Had no issues at all since it arrived just put the sim in and it got on EE's 4G no problem. Do you definitely have a N920I?
Yeah I agree. It took me a couple years to transition my mindset, but I prefer integrated batteries *as long as they are easily replaceable*. I'm pointing fingers at the iPhone here: you have to remove every component from it to replace the battery, including the digitizer, screen, motherboard, etc., and half of it is held together with double-sided tape. It is just too easy to crack the digitizer when trying to remove it. But the benefits of an integrated battery greatly outweighs the deficits. You get a phone that's lighter-weight, thinner, more durable, and because of this, it's easy to sneak in a battery that would usually oversize the phone while still being smaller. The benefits of a replaceable battery these days don't really serve practical use cases. You can replace a dead (as in un-chargeable) battery in a minute or so, but most lithium polymer batteries these days last several years. If you want to replace an internal battery on a 5-year-old phone, it takes an hour or so, and you won't need to worry about it again until it's a 10-year-old phone. You can also replace a discharged battery with a charged one, but this was really only a concern during the days where phones would run for a couple hours and charge overnight. My Note 5 charges in an hour and change and lasts about an honest 8 hours while doing normal things. Have you seen a replaceable battery junkie carry around a pocket full of charged batteries these days? Maybe in the 90s, but it's really rare to see considering how much R&ampD has gone into battery technology as of late. I think a lot of old-timey users feel like internal batteries are just another feat of planned obsolescence and that manufacturers are trying to conspire against their users. While part of this is true in an inadvertent effect, we really do get a better phone, and we still can replace the batteries. 
Android doesn't need to be jailbroken, because it is more flexible and less restrictive by design. You can root your phone to do even more cool stuff with it, but I'd recommend sticking to non-root options and apps first as there's plenty of options to explore. Also, rooting the Note 5 isn't straightforward (yet) and will permanently disable features on your phone (like Samsung Pay). I'd recommend using Package Disabler Pro to deactivate all the bloatware on your device. There's an option in the menu to automatically select any package deemed to be bloatware, although I found this turned off things like NFC and battery stats, so it's worth playing around with. So long as you're smart, it's easy to re-enable any package if you find it does something funny to your phone. Edit: linkhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ospolice.packagedisablerpro
Search Trust Agents in the S finder then turn off smart lock. It should fix the issue and you can use your fingerprint to unlock
try clearing the cache for the samsung pay app
Sometimes I'll use my S Pen if a website has tiny links, like the top bar on reddit. I use it to draw in Autodesk Sketchbook. I also use it for Baldur's Gate 2 when I play.
Long press the desktop and then choose Widgets. In the widget picker under Nova Launcher, pick the Activities widget (long press it and it'll let you drop in to your homescreen) A list will appear. Scroll down and find Settings in the list (it's a long list!) Tap settings item and will open a nested list, scroll through that and find Data Usage. Tap it. You should now have a data usage icon on your homescreen. 
It doesn't have a pressure sensitive screen. 
I'm on day 2, upgraded from an HTC M8, I'm no stranger to the new phone sparkle, but this thing is fucking *awesome.* the battery is a bit short on mine but I hope I can figure out how to fix it. 
I've gotten into Hearthstone since getting this phone last week, the stylus really helps.
Both of those games are so good with the s-pen!
I mean the Wacom digitizer 
/u/BIG_BIRD_BIG_PIMPIN what did you ever end up doing? Just got my at&ampt note 5 a week ago, my battery life is horrendous, went to bed at 55% woke up 7 hours later to a phone at 30%. 25% percent stand by on wifi in 7 hours doing nothing. seems horrible to me!! not to mention, if I use the phone for 1min, i am guaranteed to lose at least 2%
I do the same, got the Samsung wallet case and only carry my DL and debit card. 2 weeks in, haven't needed anything else.
I use my S-Pen to poke them. I guess I'll wait for the update. 
Not yet... I think we're waiting on Play Services -240, which hasn't been released yet.
Horribly slow...I'd wondered if the last update nukedsomething. I'm installing the latest update now,  will report back*edit*Did a layman's search on google. Several folks said they had to go into their router's setting and change the security to TKIP after the second to last update. Once done the download speeds are blazing fast. Just to confirm, my wifi was still extremely slow after the last update. Once changed security type to TKIP all is well.
Ebay has quite a few available for around $30In case you did not know,  the Note 5's SPen is different than previous Note's SPen
Any updates on this problem at all? Still having problems and today I discovered the L key on the pop up keyboard stopped working. Just that letter, none of the others. I really hope Samsung figures this out and develops a patch or something
It's going to be a bit different for each phone since carriers add their own bloat.  Also re-enabling all packages increased my battery life so I'm guessing one bugged out but I had a very basic list of bloat, not aggressive at all.
Beautiful image 
Having the same problem with the default cable.  Anyone tried the Fast Charge Wireless Charging Pad by Samsung?  I'm wondering if getting this will fix all my problems.
i think the most important is my photo and some videos in my device. Can it be backup at Samsung's KIES? Thanks
What's worse is they will send you a replacement first and not find issue on the original and charge you for the replacement. 
How did you do that? I set the shutter speed to 4 seconds and the entire scene lit up hahaha 
Yeah it does not look that slim, plus it's too expensive for my taste 
Worth a shot. I just did what the video instructed.My note always loses connection with my Polar M400.My LG tone headphones always connect though.
No case for me, I just put a Dbrand skin on so I have a bit more grip and no fingerprints. 
Why is this just a screenshot of your homepage?
It's the plug more than the cable but you will still need a cable that's not a complete pos. I recently bought some cables off amazon.  I'm at work on mobile so i don't have the link but I believe the reviews/questions helped indicate fast charging capabilites. 
Ya. I noticed this as well. It's like it tries to soften the skin or.something. (I know there is a soften skin setting, not that) but with your situation it is the grain from.darker settings. A camera will always need a higher iso for darker shots if the shutter is average, resulting in grain. Digital.grain looks bad. Film grain looks good. I personally bring my photo into VSCO and add grain to add a cover up to the overall look
This is a small hand problem. I don't have the issue. To me it is much more of a problem that the notification panel is so far up, but that is true on even smaller phones. For single handed use you have to use Nova launcher.
&gt  device security improvements and Amazon Shopping enhancements.Amazon shopping enhancements? Through an update?  I love amazon but I'm glad I've got their app disabled on my phone.  The mobile site works fine for me....
I'm really hoping it fixes the Bluetooth issues I've been having with it...
What bluetooth issues are you having?  My bluetooth has been great but the GPS is a coin flip, even outside.  
Can't customize? What about Knox? ) 
Updating now. I'm very much hoping that it will result in a higher reliability when sending and receiving text messages. When I have 1-3 bars out of five, I'll often receive text messages up to an hour +/- late. My Note 3 did not have these issues under the exact same conditions.
Do you find that the extra RAM shortens the battery life in any way? And typically, what use-case or workflow brings about this aggressive memory management you talk about?
This makes sense. I've also read that grime buildup on the button itself could cause issues.I might have to go back to less fancy security methods if it turns out I'm just not fastidious enough for my phone's satisfaction.
No, just marshmallow theme 
I understand. I thought the cable issue was a smaller problem, but nah, mine was terrible too, bought a 6ft cable from Anker, and now fast charge works all the time perfectly ???
Do you have haptic feedback enabled on the keyboard?
The part I dint understand with the basic scheme is that it yelows the whites. Is this how it's supposed to look, compared the whites with a 1+1 ips display and their whites were crisper than basic so I am staying with amoled the first one
Galaxy Note 5 Case, OBLIQ [Naked Shield][Clear] - with Kickstand Thin Slim Fit TPU Bumper Hard Hybrid Shock Resist Protective Clear Case https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011WD7WMM/ref=cm_sw_r_other_awd_3a6Qwb8WP8B5SI personally use this, have had no issues with the magnet. 
Another good point.. I was using that same messenger as my default SMS app. Hmm, strange for sure. It's seeming more software-related moreso.. 
I would also really like to see Citi's branded AA card make it in too. Won't work with Android pay either. 
More or less the only group of people I give a chance to is parents of toddlers / young kids. I can see how allowing their children to draw using the pen might end up with an accidental Dad I tried to put the pen in to help you situation and ending up the wrong way round.  
The official samsung case is by far the thinnest. You can't even tell it's on because it covers only the corners and the sides and in the hand you don't even notice it 
I can say that all the night pictures are on manual controls for both phones and all daytime pics are on full auto including HDR on auto. You'd have to look at the exif for each one to tell. 
Note 5 is a great phone, pleasant and smooth experience for me, no significant lag issues, been using it since release.It's important to remember that iOS does a better job at hiding lag/loading times. iPhones aren't magically blazingly fast.With my Note 5 it is not unusual to have to wait ~0.5 seconds for a tap to do what you expect. Is this unacceptable lag for you?The biggest issue with the Note 5 is how quickly it drops recent apps from memory, so if you want to play a couple video games at the same time you'll probably have to reload each game each time you switch back to it. To me this is a non-issue and one that might be improved with a software update, but many people find this unacceptable.
This is how I rationalised a Note 5 over the Edge+.    They are the same phone. The S6 and S6 Edge became Note5 and S6 Edge+.    Same core ingredients. So the only thing you need to figure out, is do you want a stylus or a curved edge screen?
It's amazing. Doesn't do much for protection, but it will give you much better grip on the back. 
I have the Spigen Neo Hybrid and I love it. I don't have the biggest hands, but the phone feels great even with the case on it. It also definitely feels like it would protect the phone from a pretty serious drop. 
I use it for almost everything. It makes playing a lot of simple games (Fallout Shelter, Marvel Puzzle Quest, et cetera) a lot easier. I use it for browsing in Sync for Reddit or in Chrome. Also, I take a lot of notes. I use it as my primary note taking device in class, so I'm constantly using it for that. 
It sounds like this isn't the issue for you, but I was shortly after I got the phone. It turned out that the USB cable wasn't securely in the power adapter. It actually takes a bit more force that I was anticipating to get it into the port on the adapter and I was being a bit too easy with it. Once I gave it a firm push, it's worked ever since. 
I wouldn't even say it's even 0.5 seconds, or rather it's on the lower side of your estimate. Android has come a long, long way when it comes to input lag. If you're really looking for the input lag, it's there, but for day-to-day use it's negligible. As for the memory issue, I'm beginning to think that might vary a lot and I don't really understand why. I have no problem picking a game back up after leaving it for a few HOURS even. I play a lot of games on my phone and switch between apps and 9/1times, the game picks right back up when I come back.As for my own personal negatives, I have noticed that if I don't reboot every couple to few days, the phone will start to get really jittery. Not exactly slow, just really not smooth. A quick reboot fixes it, but I haven't had to do that with my last few Android phones. I also really don't like how the floating S-Pen pop up works. I want the little pen button to show up, but I don't want the thing that takes over the whole screen to always pop up. It seems, though, that this is an all or nothing feature. All I have to do is click the pen button, but I have a weird/hard time getting that to work consistently.Overall, I really love my Note 5. I feel that any of the problems I've had are really minor, albeit annoying, and can easily be ignored.
I think it is Hangouts and not the Samsung Keyboard. I use Fleksy and it lags in Hangouts quite a bit. Since the new update to Hangouts it has lagged quite a bit for me. 
Beware of thin cases! I had the Ringke SLIM on my note 5 and reveled in the fact that it's barely there... right up until my phone fell 3.5 feet from a kitchen island onto ceramic tile and shattered the screen. :( Now I have a Spigen Slim Armor. I recommend using a tempered glass screen protector if you want to use a slim case. 
Because the hardware is better
Back up your phone to i cloud and download samsung smart switch
the widget is from zooper pro and the icon pack is long shadow. 
I'm in the same boat. Coming from the LG V1I'm getting way better battery life. I got about 5.5 hours SOT after about 19 hours and I haven't even fully optimized it yet. I have 4 email accounts on push, removed most Tmobile bloat, have wifi and data on, screen brightness pretty low (the screen is so damn bright it's still very viewable, plus I have sensitive eyes anyway) with lots of Web browsing messaging and news feeds. That along with some light gaming and video watching. I'm very impressed with the longevity. The V1would barely and I mean barely give me 4 hours SOT. I haven't gotten battery life this good since my rooted LG G2 with 4.4 and cloudy G2.3 rom
Good to know they were being truthful. Obviously, I got bad info from CS. Tech support is overnighting a replacement, and they said I could just ship the faulty unit back late. Great news. So much to love about this phone. Just being able to pop the s pen and start writing on the dark screen is enough of a game changer for me because I use that feature several times a day. Fast and intuitive. Thank you, everyone,  for the feedback. 
How do I start using pay on an att note 5 right now?
Note5, no contest.  The only thing the g4 has that makes it a better choice is a marginally superior camera.  Otherwise the Note5 is as premium an android device as you can find.  The G4 is a fine choice for the buck,  but otherwise you get a subpar processor,  LPDDR3 VS NOTE5 LPDDR4, and no stylus. But I'm also incredibly biased.  
People on /r/android love stock Android, but the majority of normal consumers don't care at all and many might actually prefer TouchWiz. It's not nearly as big of a deal to most people as it might seem by reading reddit comment sections. The Note 5 also has a theme store where you can download a material theme to make it look fairly close to stock Android. The LG G4 does not have that and, in my opinion, LG's skin is the ugliest of any of the major OEMs. If having a removable battery and SD card slot is important to you then you might want to go with the G4, but otherwise I would say the Note 5 is significantly better. The G4 is probably less expensive as well so that might be something you'd want to consider. 
Note 5.  I just got one to replace my Note 3 which replaced an iphone, and I can't see ever going back to an iphone - I found everything better with Android.  And I really don't see why so many people hate TouchWiz, I like it.  My wife just got an iphone 6 plus, and the Note 5 beats it in every way...  The non-removable battery is only a big deal for heavy users who need to go from 0% to 100% instantly, and in 2 years I never needed to do that...  I had a 32 GB SD card in my Note 3 and got by fine with that, so a 64 GB Note 5 will work fine for me.
I went through the same questions, although I ditched iphones over a year ago for nexus 4 then 5 to get the stock Android experience.I've been eying samsung phones from afar since the s5 but never considered them as my biggest problem with Samsung was the horrendous reputation of touchwiz.I almost went with the s6, but again all the performance problems with touchwiz reported by others on reddit made me hold back.I've had the note 5 for 2 weeks now on t-mobile and compared to stock Android it's quite good, I was expecting a lot more crap getting in the way. The os runs super smooth so far and it seems t-mobile is really good at issuing updates since we already have the latest 5.1.1 patches.And to me it's no contest with the g4, other than pricing, the note 5 has better features and looks better, also kills the iPhone 6 or 6s+ in many respects imo.
Did you sign up as a beta tester and has your application been accepted? If so, you should be able to launch the stub Samsung Pay app already installed on the Note 5 and it will allow you to download the actual beta app. From there, you just follow the instructions in the app to add your bank account from one of the banks who are participating in the beta trial. After your bank verifies your info, you are ready to use Samsung Pay.
I had the G4 before having my Note 5. While they're both great phones I absolutly love my note 5. My G4 battery life started out great but quickly deterated to where I was getting only 2hrs SOT over a 8hr period. Even 2 weeks into my note I can easily pull 5+ hours which was something that rarely ever happened at the beginning of my G4. The S-pen is awesome. It is something I use fairly often for things like taking quick notes, drawing on pictures and highlighting screen shots. I do feel touchwiz is a little better now than the G4's UI. It seems lighter and much snappier. More so than the difference between my G3 and note 4 last year. I explained my feelings on both cameras in an earlier post and ill try to dig that up but bottom line they're both great. Here's an album of each camera though. G4  https://flic.kr/s/aHskbqdCr3 and Note 5 https://flic.kr/s/aHskgzfnLY The note 5 to me feels better in hand as well. While the g4 does feel small for such a big screen you will start wishing you had the bigger screen. I'm not a huge fan of on screen buttons either. I have always liked samsung solution, the physical buttons. Knock code is a pain in the butt and note 5s fingerprint sensor is on point. Blazing fast. No swiping and just accurate as hell. Hope this helps. Edit here is what I say about the cameras differences. http://www.reddit.com/r/galaxynote5/comments/3kgs6l/low_light_photos/cuxhcz5
Hey. I just switched from the iPhone 6 Plus to the Note 5. Happy to offer what made the decision for me:- The current iteration of TouchWiz is pretty remarkable, actually. It's fast, smooth, and uncluttered compared to previous versions. I, like most others on /r/android, definitely want something as close to stock Android as possible, so what surprised me was how much I like TouchWiz. Also, with their theme store built in, you can buy a Material (Android/Material Design/stock) skin for $1.39. With that on TouchWiz, I didn't really need anything else customized on this phone. I'm using stock keyboard and Touchwiz. The only apps I've changed out were for Google apps ????Chrome, Gmail, Calendar ????and texting (from Samsung's messaging app to Textra). Super easy.- Camera is spectacular. Just spectacular.- Love the screen. This thing is vivid, bright, big and light.- The build of the phone feels fantastic I like it as much or better than the feel of the 6 Plus.- The battery life is really great. I think I'm just a *little* underwhelmed by it (because the 6 Plus was just incredible in my opinion for battery life), but having a phone with quick charge means I can recharge this thing super fast, and often, and with the chargers being $15 or so (that's just first-party options), it's easy and cheap to grab one for work and at home.- This is a big one in my opinion: Retail support. If you're going to buy Android, if you're going to resell it at some point in the future, if you're going to buy accessories for it - you need to buy a Samsung phone. There's just not mass retail support in any meaningful way for other brands. People buy Samsung phones, so stores stock accessories and support the devices. You can get help when you need help. It's as close to an in-person infrastructure for sales and support as you can get to the Apple Store experience.That's the short list off the top of my head. Hope it helps with your decision. I can't speak poorly of the LG G4 in any way, but I did have an LG G3 when it came out and found myself constantly tweaking and changing it (obsessively) because I just wasn't impressed with the UI.
There's an app called Sketch for Keep on [Google Play.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lv.piip.sketchforkeep&amphl=en) I haven't used it, Reviews seem mixed.
Lags for me too. But I like the stock keyboard more than Googles.
The plastic scratches ridiculously easy.  I got a new note5 out of the box with a nasty scratch on the cover.  I made VZ give me a new phone.  I can't think of any safe way to remove whats already on there.  Just be careful with it.  
Lol. Well, GPS.apks are a nightmare since there are like a million of them. Install the wrong one and your phone goes bonkers.It OTAd to my Note 5 today, AP works. Now that the excitement is over, it's just the same 'ol Google Wallet, limited to NFC and not anything special.Bring on magnetic transmitting Samsung Pay! Now THATs game changing!
You can disable the swipe to call / message.
That's how all phone batteries charge. From 0-65ish percent it gets as much charge as possible quickly ie. speed. It charges slower if the screen is on to prevent overheating. At 80ish percent and above it trickle charges to keep the battery healthy over a longer period of time
In addition to what others have said, run your finger on the top 1/8 of the screen. Read some users had problems with it not detecting touches. 
It has to be asked....You know the Data Usage chart only tracks Mobile Data, and not Wi-Fi usage, right? So if you were connected to Wi-Fi while watching YouTube, none of that is supposed to be recorded in the Data Usage chart.Now that we've got that out of the way, if you log into your carrier's site and/or app, how much data does it show you as having used?
I still can't believe that this is a problem that affects a significant number of people. I guess I've been giving people too much benefit of doubt. It just seems absurd to me that people can mix up which end of the pen they're using. It seems like a pants-on-backwards type of error. 
This picture sucks 
It's the gold model, lighting might not be the best at work for the photos. Taken on a note 4
Yes, because it is outfitted with NFC
This would be incorrect. It works fine on AT&ampT. You will get LTE. Proof: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3184042
I loved my Note 4 protective cover but the new one for Note 5 is just not protective enough for me. Does anyone know where I can find something as slim as the Note 4 protective one? The only one that I've found that's kinda close to it is the UAG case 
Already disabled 15apps on Package Disable. I see people with 7 hour SOT. How is that even possible?!
Any of the pink ones are probably bloatware that you can disable. Don't use the disable all bloatware feature in the menu, it turns off things you may need. Don't disable Smart Manager, as that will disable battery stats in the settings menu. I avoided disabling some things marked in pink if I didn't understand what it was or it looked important. For example, disabling Samsung Account caused a health to crash if when I tried to log in. NFC service is flagged as bloatware, but it isn't (if you use payment services). 
Im wondering this also. For some reason NFC won't turn on for me, and I think it must have something to do with something I disabled.
Well, maybe it will happen before Oct 11th. Keep your fingers crossed. 
Yeah I have sometimes, I thought it was app i was using.  Usually when browsing reddit with sync 
More than likely disabled something NFC needs to operate. I'd go thru stuff that you disabled. 
I did multiple times, Im not seeing anything that I think would disable NFC
I notice this occasionally, it will stop responding to me trying to scroll. I'm not sure if its the touchscreen, or me putting pressure on the edge of the screen accidentally while holding the phone.
Does it really work flawlessly every time? As an example, third party keyboard integration is *awful* according to every iPhone user I've asked.
Yeah I was/still having the same issue I unplug my phone around 7 am and by 1 I have to recharge it i got package disabler and that helped a little also turning off location helped but the battery improvement hasn't been much no idea what's going on either. 
It was on Black Friday so I got a pretty great deal that has ended sadly, keep note the phone would most likely be from Singapore, it comes with some weird software that you can disable easily 
Did you make sure all your background tabs in chrome are closed? It is a possibility that some javascript or flash website is open in the background and it's keeping the cpu busy all the time. 
Passpoint is a special Hotspot protocol. It would be very difficult to set up a fake AP, because your phone uses your SIM to authenticate. There is a very complicated setup process on the server end, which probably uses the same servers that AT&ampT has at the cell-site. Furthermore, connections are not negotiated by looking for a specific SSID, but using a Query/Response protocol, which enables clients to determine which APs support the credentials that they can provide. That is, your phone performs a scan and asks each AP what credentials it supports. If your phone has something that matches those options, it will try to connect.It is *probably* as safe as connecting to a cell tower, which you're doing all the time, plus it uses WPA-EAP and WPA2 is required.   So, it is encrypted with the best possible option. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Authentication_Protocol#EAP-SIM and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.1XThe non-Passpoint hotspots, which all have the same SSID, are not as secure, because as mentioned, someone could spoof that SSID.
Fast charging is an option.  U get a fast charging power brick with  higher output.  U can just use a normal brick for normal charging.  Disadvantages include heating,  some people say it slowly damages your battery but I domt think so
I'm on Sprint, too. I'm pretty sure it's when I either get a text or some other notification, and but that may not be related. It doesn't matter if I'm on wifi or mobile data. It will just lose the stream for seemingly no reason. It just did it as I'm typing this as my phone switched to wifi! . I can change stations, but I can't get it to come back, and it just hangs with the ring spinning around the stop button like it's trying to reconnect. 
Searched around because I just started having this issue. I know it may be different for other people but the fix for me was uninstalling the Fb Messenger app. Hope everyone else finds a solution. Thanks for all the input so far!
Damn dude.. I'm running a similar theme and I have package disabler pro.. this yhis is pretty efficient.. If I get those type of numbers I'll post.. I'm currently @ 40% with 4.5 SOT
I'm using the spigen case. I'm not sure I'd recommend it but it was better than alot of cheapo options I found. It uses a magnetic clasp that interferes with the s pen, the card holders are a bit big and I've had cards slide out a few times. the construction seems to be holding up to my abuse but I have noticed a lot of freying around the edges. I'd probably preferred it without the card holder to reduce the bulk.
For me, the iPhone keyboard is miles ahead of any Android keyboard (though Samsung's is the best Android keyboard), and it loads really quickly. The iOS keyboard actually has a method by which it predicts which letter you're going to touch next and increases the touch target area around that letter to minimize potential errors. So for me, the stock keyboard rocks -- even compared to things that seem faster/better in theory like Swype. That said, you're right, third party keyboard integration is rough on iOS, but it's unneeded in my opinion.
Try to use the Samsung gaming downscale app and play at lower resolution 
Very cool. Are you using two different icon packs? If so, which?
Smart switch also backs up call history, forgot to mention
How would you even confuse a gaming rom with a custom rom, considering this is a galaxy note sub.. You got a little too happy about correcting someone you thought was wrong, didn't you? 
I don't know.  I did it back in like October when they were offering the wireless charger.  I don't remember if i sent a picture of my remote.  (I believe I did though).  But, I just had to sign in for this offer.
Hi there, Thanks for the help, again! Here's a screenshot https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B6cXBYHBraqTX2JLMkEwQklORE0&ampusp=sharingEverything was working fine before, i don't recall changing any settings on the phone its self, so I'm really not sure why it would stop working :/
That's an issue with the phone not getting into deep sleep.I had the same issue my first night. Rooted it, installed VENOM ROM and with SkyKernel, now I lose 2-3% overnight and the battery comfortably lasts me a day. Certainly beat the shit out of my wifes iPhone 6, to the point where she sold it and bought a Samsung.
Once you're in a subreddit there's a + icon at the top right of the screen, press that.
I'll just say this as the major difference - the Note 5 tends to lag, especially on the keyboard. The Nexus 6P is much more fluid. 
I use a wallet case. I love putting it in tent mode.
There's an app in the play store called Doze that helps with battery life in a different way than the Doze feature of Marshmallow. 
this was me like 5 days ago between the edge+ and the note 5... :( 
*#0011# select wifi and set power save to off. But it may be a sign of other issues. I have been getting 2 hours of sot because of wifi.
Chainfire has a root for marshmallow that doesn't modify the system partition. On nexus phones you can still get OTAs after rooting. So it is completely possible for him to make a root that would bypass the system and not trip knox(if system partition is not modified, knox is not tripped). Sorry I'm on mobile, it's pretty hard to find links for proof but you can lookup systemless root. 
FAIR WARNING, since I made the same upgrade you are about to make:If you hold the Note 5 in your left hand, you will not be able to reach the back button with your thumb, and it is going to make you angry. On the G3, there are ways to customize your on-screen home row buttons. On the Note, you are stuck with what you've got. (EDIT: You can't root or flash the AT&ampT version either...)I love everything else about the phone except for this. It's almost enough to make me want to sell this thing to you (I'm on AT&ampT as well), and go get a Nexus 6P.
they're saved as an action memo. I think you won't be able to do this as the point of the lock screen is that you can't do anything on the phone without unlocking it. Features like taking a picture or these notes are specialized functions on the lockscreen that ensure you can only save the photo, or save that note. 
Do you use a screen dimming app? 
Try bypassing Winamp altogether. Drag and drop a couple albums onto your phone and use the stock player. If you still have problems, then it's in the transfer and not applications you're using. 
 I added those in after the down votes and I only did it to show that they shouldn't be freaking out about the benchmark scores. 
For some reason it turned off swipe and the auto correct and punctuation and everything. Thank you sir
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00UWPX3KW?psc=1&ampredirect=true&ampref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00I use one of the six foot ones from that package and my phone charges well and indicates Fast Charging
Yes noticed it too, but it does that happen often enough so I'm never sure if it's just me thinking I pressed the button when I missed it.I've turned on the Sutter sound to make sure a photo is actually taken, haven't noticed it since but it's only been a short while.
If you want a music player for songs on your phone, I recommend [Phonograph](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kabouzeid.gramophone). Very smooth, beautiful material design, and a simple yet functional interface. 
Make sure in the app optimizations section you have turned off optimization for the swiftkey keyboard or whatever custom keyboard you're using. See if that helps.
Sounds super annoying.I just do the Windows drag and drop with no issues.
I prefer [Weather Timeline's](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samruston.weather&amphl=en) widgets.
The actual camera is inside of the blue metal part, sort of sunken in. The main damage was directly towards the center, so the center of the glass broke off completely, and I chipped the glass away by having the knife below it and peeling it off. I mainly use my camera as a backup, since I have an mirrorless camera to take pictures with. I don't think that the part I got was an actual OEM part, since the OEM part includes the metal frame cover, which is significantly harder to replace (I assume that is what your shop is doing). I only paid $4 for the just the piece of glass, so as long as you don't poke a knife at the actual camera, you can go the $5route if you don't like it (for $50, I'm assuming they replaced the entire metal frame cover for the camera, which is a lot harder to do).
I'd go with Google photos. It's free and unlimited, and very useful if you're a big Google user
Yeah the write on pdf app update mentions marshmallow also. Good to see they are prepping 3 months ahead of release. 
I noticed this too. The wifi at the dorm is weaker and the battery doesn't last as long as when it's connected to my home wifi.
Isn't that top-left screen thing related to FB Messenger? I've read uninstalling it solves the problem for (some? all? most?) people.
I was in the same boat as you.  Came from Note 4 and loved the Protective Cover.  The best case I have found for the Note 5 is the Spigen Rugged Capsule.  This case is EXCELLENT.  Great feel in hand and excellent fit.   Very minimal as well.  The current picture on Amazon is incorrect so I linked Spigen site as well  also, check out all those 5 star reviews on Amazon.  Easily the highest rated case.http://www.spigen.com/collections/galaxy-note-5/products/galaxy-note-5-case-rugged-armorhttp://www.amazon.com/Galaxy-Spigen%C2%AE-Resilient-Ultimate-protection/dp/B010MWFUBY
Wifi is always on, brightness always @ 50%, mobile data always on.  Apps I use is normal stuff like instagram,  sync for reddit,  feedly, pushbullet etc. Fb was disabled from day 1. Location usually on, if home and I remember I'll turn it off.  I use Line a lot for messaging with my friends.  Guess I'm just normal heavy user
I have two right now, one from the Test Drive program and the other I just purchased since I liked it so well.  Neither of them have uneven screens. There is a slight difference in color temperature and clarity between them. With that said, my Note 4 had the same problem. It was blue at the top and yellow at the bottom. This isn't that uncommon of an issue on AMOLED screens. 
I've been looking. Since its part of the Qi standard. I'm sure we will see something eventually. Especially when more phones start supporting it.
I use the s pen pretty heavily and not noticing any scratches. Any other circumstances you can think of regarding your screen scratches? 
This makes me very pessimistic, AT&ampT doesn't give a shit, they have no obligation or incentive to EVER push that fucking update.
Uh.  I got a Samsung wireless charger on amazon for $39
For sure read the title. He is talking about a fast wireless charger. There is a pretty significant difference between what you have and what he's looking for. 
Dashlane is a password manager that can fill in login forms using your fingerprint to unlock the database.
I actually got mine last night! I don't get the 'stutter' as you mention. It could be because you have some apps running in the background?? And yes, the clarity isn't, the best? I wear glasses so I'm not sure how much that plays a role (far sighted) but videos feel unfocused and unclear. I'd suggest downloading videos. Streaming ruins the experience in my opinion. Even with high speed internet.
It charges fairly fast. A word of warning about your battery issue Here in /r/galaxynote5, claims of the phone's battery being sub-par are often ignored and refuted. Your issues don't exist, and it must be something you are doing wrong, by not tweaking and tinkering with your device until you get it balanced on the needle it needs to maintain an above-average power rating. You're still using the features that come with the device, so obviously you're an uneducated putz, and you should just buy an iPhone./s
Appreciate the quick response. I wish it was quicker but I guess you can't complain about free money
Change the grid size on the home screen to something smaller, and on the app drawer, hide the icons and change the grid size.
No notification led.I want the amoled screen.Better SOT.SPEN for spreadsheets at work.I don't like the on screen menu. buttons. Would rather have a hard key.I want the quick launch camera at any time like the note offers.Since I don't find the 2nd screen useful I would rather have the shorter lighter note.I really dislike the non removable battery and non expandable storage which is why I got the v1but the issues above are enough to make me go back to it.
lost connection again with my polar m400.My Nexus 6 kept connection with no problems. It's not a huge deal to input a new bluetooth pin but it would be nice if everything worked 
You need to set your camera to make sure that the photo is under 5Mb. 
I leave my phone on the wireless charger when I go to bed every night and have no issues. In fact, for me once charging has finish, it won't charge anymore. I'm pretty sure that's the case because I would wake up and have 95-98% battery instead of 100%. 
You're welcome. It was driving me batty for a few days until my buddy saw this somewhere and we gave it a try. I'd have awesome battery one day and crap the next. Since I disabled the Oculus app, it's seemingly evened out and has gone back to being pretty good. 
Yes I've run into this issue quite a bit. I haven't found a permanent fix, but unplugging the USB from charging block then plugging it back in generally works.It also sometimes doesn't work if you're plugged into a surge protector rather than a wall outlet. Good luck! 
Google Now &gt S Voice.  I use Tasker to listen for when S Voice becomes active to then hit home key and open Google Voice Search.  This allows me to have the ability to wake the phone from screen off (S Voice) but always interact with Google Now instead of S Voice.  Overall its a blessing and a curse because hands free is critical but I do suffer an input delay (First, with S Voice [ S Voice is Slower to respond in general than Google Now] then with quick transfer to open Google Now. It has its ups and downs but I will gladly take the extra 1.5-2.5 seconds to deliver a command rather than either use S voice (bad) or Google Now (can't access with screen off).    
Hexlock can use fingerprints, but there's always an option to do a pattern or pin as well, which kills the only I can do it thing. 
I have the fast charge pad and the standard. The fast charge works really well but the standard one always stops charging at random times and also doesn't maintain the phone at 100%.
Nah, I just took pictures in case anyone wanted to see what the skin or case looked like. That clear case you've linked above is more or less the same as the flip wallet I have, but it's made of polycarbonate instead of polyurethane leather. 
&gtDropped my phoneAt least you didn't crack your phone/screen. 
Can you post a screen shot? I'm not familiar with the overlay, and I'm using a fingerprint as well. 
Could you link the video please? I can't seem to find it. 
I typically do have a glass screen protector but thanks for the heads up!
OP I don't have a Note 5 so can't answer this particular question. However, since you are a fan of multi window, try this app. It allows you to designate actual icons on your homescreen so that with one tap it opens up your previously defined recipes. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobi.xperiacle.multiwindow.pair&amphl=en
One more thing, Go to lock screen and security&gtother security settings&gtdevice administrators  and turn off Android Device Manager. Try it for a day and let me know if its fixes your idle drain!

Care to share a screenshot? 
I'm used to the Nexus 5 capacitative home button.  Sometimes I'll just sit there touching the Note 5 home button and think the phone has stopped responding or something.  Then I remember it's a click button...
You may try this: http://www.willmyphonework.netand read this: http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/how-to/mobile-phone/how-tell-whether-phone-is-supported-by-your-network-3597426/Dual sim means you can insert two sim cards into the phone, whereas single sim has only one sim card slot, so you can have only one sim card in a phone at a time.Image of dual sim note 5 version: http://cdn.ndtv.com/tech/samsung_galaxy_note_5_dualsim_leak_basiclife.jpg
I use blackberry keyboard. Really great and underrated. I previously used flesky but switched to the blackberry keyboard when the APK became available.
I would still have PDP unbranded or not. Since I favor Nova and chrome instead of TW and the stock browser
too much light. send the iso to 100. aperture too as big as possible, like f10. then shutter speed adjust accordingly 
wait, where's the back button located?
AT&ampT notes can't be bootloader unlocked, only T-Mobile, Sprint, and some international models. So keep that in mind, if you ever want to flash a rom for whatever reason, good luck.  Samsung stops updating your variant? Nothing you can do about it. I wouldn't go as far as to call it shooting yourself in the foot, but if you ever want something, a new feature or update, you're at the mercy of Samsung and AT&ampT.As far as root goes, it's really about the type of user you are. If you can be content using the phone as is, then you don't need root. But sometimes you have to do something that really does require root. For example, I use a chat app called kakaotalk. It saves all my chatlogs and other data locally, inside the app data part of the storage. There is no export or online backup, and I couldn't access the locally saved data without root. So when I moved to a new phone and I wanted to transfer that over, well, I had to have both phones rooted in order to do so. No or impossible root? Shit outta luck.Another example would be removing T-Mobile's tether restriction, on the T-Mobile variant. The native tethering app would call home to check your plan's tethering status and tethering data before letting you tethe, and then report back your tethering data usage. Coming from a Nexus, this is not something I wanted my phone to do. Getting rid of this required modifying the system partition, which again, is impossible without root.So for me, root is necessary. But that really depends on the kind of user you are. And before you go and root a Samsung phone, just remember that rooting will trip Knox, which is permanently tripped and can't ever be undone for the life of your phone. Tripping Knox will stop you from using Samsung pay and other Knox secured features. It's also an excuse for Samsung to deny your warranty.
I just got one of these for Christmas but can't figure out how to watch Netflix on it yet.
It's the Material Dark theme and the font is GeosansLight and was installed using iFont.
On the note 5 you can add up to 4 fingers, which is very very cool..On the iPhone 6, you can add up to 5 fingers, I don't know why you would need 5.....Not a fanboy but a little biased?
I own a 6S Plus and a Galaxy Note 5, and at great risk to my karma, I can say without a doubt that the Note 5 is an excellent device, but it's not nearly as good as my 6S Plus
Someone mentioned to me that they had read that you could put the pen in backwards and never get it out. I had never really paid attention, but after reading this I tried putting in several different ways. the only way that seemed to be the 'wrong way' would be upside down with the stylus tip pointing away from the phone. In the other orientations it didn't matter which direction I inserted the pen.   I have a VZW version for reference.
Yea and many people def get that. I've tried it all the tricks you see in this subreddit and have almost no improvement. I've accepted not all notes are created equal. That being said the fast charging makes it bearable. 
I switched to the Note 5 from the S5 a few months ago. I regularly get 12+ hours of heavy use out of the phone before I charge it. As of this post I am at 8 hours and still have 45% battery life. Currently at 4.5 hours Screen on Time. I use my phone to stream Hulu and Netflix over a Chromecast and even that doesn't drain my battery like it did with my S5. 
I'm currently at 6 hours 24 minutes SOT on my Note 5, with 4% left. Pretty much everything is turn on except Bluetooth and nfc. 
Have you tried using a chromecast to mirror your phone?
I have. Both with software and the hard button. This is the second Note 5 that's done it
Nope, actually getting the full 90Mbps wireless at my dad's on non AC wifi. Range is great and speed is awesome. Double what I ever saw on my Nexus 6.
Note 4 feels a little bigger, but you may still need it for the SD card and replaceable batttery.  The battery on the note 5 was reviewed as being able to stay in good condition for until the time you next upgrade (1 year, or probably longer, don't remember who said this, though.)     Ultimately, thogh, **only you** can determine if the phone is worth it to you.  To me it was... if only because it reduced my T-mobile bill by $3 per month when I OG-Jumped to it.  Suggestion, though:  Get a wireless charging pad.  Even a regular, non-fast charging one, becomes an excellent investment in convenience.
Here's my experience with smartphones so far... G2X, Galaxy Nexus,  HTC Sensation,  G2, G3, Nexus 6, Note 4, S6, and finally the Note5. Here are my honest impressions.  I'll address your concerns first.  The phone is large.  I have very large hands,  so this is almost a benefit to me. If you are clumsy,  this isn't the phone for you.  It's a very expensive device (get the insurance) with a premium build that looks beautiful so long as you NEVER DROP IT. I kept mine in the package until my S View case arrived from Amazon. Haven't dropped it yet but I guarantee it'll break the first time it kisses the ground,  case or not. If you can get over this fact,  continue reading.  Battery life is gangsta. My SOT is better than any previous phone. Quick charge is the final saving grace.  I can't tell you how many times I was twenty minutes away from going somewhere and that 1/3 hour charging saved my ass. I was originally going to get the G4 as it literally has everything I felt the Note5 lacked,  EXCEPT quick charge capability. I will never buy another handset that lacks this component. The phone deserves far more praise than concern. I upgrade every year and I believe this phone will keep me happy until I can put my hands on a Note6. Here's what I dislike about the device.  It's new and has some bugs, not horribly so but enough to consider before buying right now.  All devices are a bit buggy the first few months after launch.  Nothing is broken per se, just don't expect a zero glitch experience. It's fragile.  If you are hard on your phones take pause here. It's expensive. The lacking SD card support is mostly mitigated with two free years of 100gigs worth of cloud storage. I had a 128 gig card in my Note 4. It was almost full. With my 5 I realized I'd rather have extremely fast data transfer and limit the account of crap I horde on my device.  I went with the 32gig model in case you're wondering. I've got a lot of apps and music and still have about 1gigs free.I don't care about the lacking infared port. I'm don't mind the sealed battery now,  though to be honest this almost kept me from buying it originally. I wanted the latest and greatest and I feel I've got it. If you have any other questions I'll respond.
currently android os been awake for 40m 30s, CPU total 57m 13s. That's after 16hours of usage so far. Your stats don't seem normal to be honest I'm not sure how you're using the phone, but even though you should at least get more than 13hours of standby time. Have you tried Package Disabler Pro? 
I completely understand, Did you buy your phone from Verizon or Sprint by any chance? These are the only two models that people seem to have poor battery life with even with the s6 
I would say connect to wifi when you can, it helps your battery life by alot. Disable VoLTE etc and try to disable some bloat since it can help. It's a shame that some carriers go too far with their tweaks and adjustments on Android devices which literally ruins your whole experience with the phone :( I never thought I would say this but consider the iphone 6 plus if you really care about battery life and if you want to stay with Sprint. 
That's cute, but it's not exactly meant to be a stylus. 
Shout out to r/electronic_cigarette. If anyone's New Year's resolution is to quit smoking, pay it a visit. 
I don't think handicapping your phone to 3G is the best solution. It may be for your specific case though, because your 4G signal is so weak you may see additional drain from 4G switching to 3G back and forth trying to achieve the best signal. As for the OP I'd start looking in Settings&gtBattery to see which apps may be draining the battery the most. Anyway that's just my 2 cents so whatever, what do I know.
Try going into Costco and look at their pricing. I ended up getting my Note 5 for $44 after a rebate (Costco Cash Card) on Verizon. But I also renewed a 2 year contract. So I had an upgrade to spare. Without an upgrade there would be a nominal monthly fee as you paid off the phone.
those are my icons 
I had something like this until I needed to validate something good with a fingerprint.
You misspelled 'whoreless' - and why on earth would you want a charger to come without one?  Mine came with a terrific whore who puts out, doesn't eat too much, and keeps herself clean - 10/10.
I see a lot of boasting but not a lot of recommending. You don't share your wireless chargers
Nova Launcher, Galaxy Button Lights, Squid, Simplemind, Package Disabler Pro
Did the fix. Used it starting at 83ish percent battery. Down to 11 percent, I had 5 hours and 2minutes SOT. Also streamed podcast for 2.5 hours while biking. Otherwise reddit Facebook via browser. Chrome. Light videos.
I have Bluetooth available, wifi, LTE, so pen and apps
I got accepted into the beta program but everyone i want to add a card i get a ''connection error''
So far I was able to add all the cards to Android pay. I added the Google wallet card also.
To clarify, the GearVR headset is a whole other world than the cardboard, there are LARGE differences in quality of experience.The analogy would be riding a bicycle to driving a ferrari. John Carmack got chip-level access to program the firmware to run with the GearVR specifically. GearVR has built in high quality sensors that interface with the phone, they don't use the phones sensors like Cardboard does. GearVR also runs at a locked 60-fps, a crucial component to avoiding motion sickness... Again, absent in cardboard.The notion that cardboard ~= GearVR is super off base. No offence or anything, just want to be clear (I own a Dk2 and know a lot about VR shit :D)
I second that, The point is that it works with the Android Wear app which is compatible. I'm using my LG G Watch on my Note 5. Not a single issue to report.
Clicking in doesn't actually lock the s-pen in the phone.
Your phone has space aids. Not sure if it's covered by warranty. 
Yeah, no kidding! They're proud of those suckers. I'm curious how much they make from misplaced S pens. You know those things cost next to nothing to make. 
What messaging app are you using? I had that problem with Hangouts, so I switched to Textra. Haven't had any problems since.
But you said that you already have it and use it at work... Anyway it's too late, I've ordered it. The thought of walking around with this thing unprotected terrifies me. It should hold me off until someone makes a decent battery case that actually works. 
Why am I shooting video a phone when I have Nikon gear?  D700s don't shoot video, and until recently I've been them exclusively.  I now have a D80as well, but prefer to shoot stills.  25+ years of still photography, never had much interest in pro video work.I would also need to expand my gear to include a mic and perhaps a frame - interfering with still shooting.  Getting a release to shoot video would be a bit different, and isn't my thing.  For me, video is more for my personal use with friends and family - something I can share on Snapchat/Instagram/Facebook, or for my personal viewing later.
The audio IS great!  Any experience at a rock concert, with amplified bass?
It's not just a piece of plastic. Take a look at this tear down video.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beQq6-wr4i8&ampfeature=iv&ampsrc_vid=Thod_N0fnj4&ampannotation_id=annotation_115548
No, but I could probably go crank something in the car and see how that goes ?
Do you have auto lock on power button pressed?  What's your lock timeout?  That might be the cause
That was it. It was set for 1minutes instead of with the power button or screen timeout. Thanks for everything
May I recommend Squid app? Its pages can stretch unlimited vertically or horizontally. The penmanship does not look good as S-note, but it still recognizes pressure and adjusts thickness. You can also assign S-pen button to eraser, saves notes as PDF,auto back up to Dropbox, etc. I also use it to sign any PDF document, but I believe that it's a paid feature. Anyways, check it out! 
Clean out your jeans pockets. I have noticed debris gathering in the very bottom. Once I cleaned that my phone didn't gather much junk anymore.
What is Wireless network under? 
Check for cracks IN the screen..
I tried comparing it to the usb plug and it looks identical. The micro usb flash drive fits into S3 perfectly fine. But it wouldn't fit in my note 5 or S6. Which is very odd. I've ordered another micro usb drive to test it out.
Change your usb cable. They go bad constantly
It depends. If a large portion of your battery life is consumed by the cell service/standby it's likely from the time it spends on the CDMA bands. That is what hogs power, but I'm not sure if the LTE VZW uses hogs a lot of power or not as well. But that's the price you pay for better connectivity. 
Not the best picture but you get the idea. http://imgur.com/whbWTBs
My Verizon phone did not come with earbuds.  The FB app is uninstallable, but you can disable it.The phone sometimes slows down.  I think it's a few of the downloadable themes.  When I've experienced slowdown, I'll change the theme, and voila.... the slowdown is gone.  Of course, I delete those slow themes from my phone afterward.
This same thing happens with any keyboard.Thanks though. 
I hear what you're saying. I wish tech always worked perfectly too. I hope you use your head and prevent this from occurring in the future by at least taking a picture of the gift card and keep saved in your phone until you have exhausted the funds. Technically you're  suppose to keep the physical gift card (or at least the identifying info) as per the agreement with the merchant who administers the gift card funds. If you read the full disclosure offered online you'll see you've already received a warning about lost or stolen funds. It's not Samsung's responsibility to warn you again. That being said,  you could go to the people who gave you the gift cards and try to track down a receipt. Then it's just a matter of calling the company who services the gift cards. Goodluck!
Settings &gt sounds and notifications &gt ringtones and sounds
I have it &amp I like it a lot. It is a bit slippery, but the buttons feel great and it'll protect it well from drops. Another reason I like it is cause it's clear and I can print out pictures to put behind the shell as a way to customize my phone for cheap. 
[Here's a screenshot of the option inside the Battery settings.  I believe some carriers do not have it.  I have T-Mobile btw.](http://imgur.com/3oPBAb5)  It seems to have improved my battery life over time (I've had it for a few months now).  On the downside for the past 2 weeks I've been having problems with Google Now reminders when using place in which they are not being displayed when I reach my trigger destination, and I'm thinking it may be because of the App Optimization.  Need to do some testing to see if that's the problem.
You can install the stock google keyboard from the app store like any other third party one (swiftkey, swype, etc) - I'd link you but the New Zealand app store probably doesn't' help much =)
You could tell package disabler pro to knock off all bloat but it did stop things I find useful from working. E.g. screen casting to a smart TV or PC, having my lock screen wallpaper cycle between a set I selected... I would just recommend going through the app drawer and picking apps you don't want to use and disabling them. You can also disable the gear watch services etc if you don't be using them but the names aren't always so obvious.I also installed Arrow launcher because I don't want to be manually selecting which apps are on the home screen. This launcher puts the app's you use regularly there and it keeps your home screen updated dynamically as it learns your usage patterns.
Using nova launcher , and still have problems with touch screen
Finally got it to go idle! No drain while the screen was off.I uninstalled DS Battery Saver, disabled Clean Master's Auto-Kill feature.More services I disabled through Package Disabler include **wfdbroker** and **thememanager**.No more 'Android System' in the background when I check running apps.http://imgur.com/SpKuIx6http://imgur.com/OAasI7MUpdate, projected 24 hours.http://imgur.com/NuyFia5
No, no Pay apps will be usable with non-secure (non-factory) software. I've read that they will be maybe usable in Marshmallow, but there is no way to use them once you trip Knox. Not sure which clock you mean, but you can change just about everything about the notification area and everywhere else. It sounds like this is a good fit for you, other than the Android Pay thing. But who really cares about that?
Same. And since I installed PDP just aft I got the phone, I never noticed how many features (good and bad) came with my Note. Recently reset the phone and left it stock plus my essential apps. Battery is about the same, but the phone has way more gimmicky stuff crammed in.
Just randomly, I bought the note 5 in August and this has happened 4 or 5 times.  I was going to say clearing the cache has helped, but I actually caught it before it completely killed my battery (usually I don't notice it, it's at 40% or so and then it's dead).It's not always a hog, 99% of the time it's fine
http://imgur.com/Uf4wwziHere is my current setup with Muzei, Elun Icons, Action Launcher, Chronus, Month Calendar Widget, and Flat Status Bars (xposed).
Why should I stop with the Cleanmaster? I also don't seem to have Smart Manager. Maybe it is disabled but I do not see any packages related to it.
Considering I get about an hour and a half on the S5 when wifi is on, I imagine the Note *has* to be better at this point lol.  I like the idea of more vivid color, as an artist I'm picky about colors. 
Couldn't have picked a better combo for that gold Note 5. Can't seem to find a good skin for my white Note
Haha yeah I was kidding. Good for you! What's the name of your theme? 
Thanks for the tip. Is it stable in landscape mode if your mount it at the bottom? 
Also on Rogers, not sure if it's what you're looking for, but I found a setting here :Phone app--&gt more --&gt settings --&gt outgoing voice call settings --&gt do not allow VoLTE calls
Interesting, I'm with Rogers as well and have Knox enabled yet I have none in my options. 
If only I didn't need my bandwidth for R6: Siege...
Yes please. I saw another user's wallet case, but I want to see yours and also the Spigen case. Since yours it look like it's white
I uninstalled knox and that fixed the problem.
Fuck me running man. I switched from sprint cause they kept dicking around and swapping my upgrade dates ($15 a month for early upgrade and I got, idk lol from every single rep I spoke to) and I got the note 5 on Verizon, cause better service, new phone, and I own a company that just acquired a second foodservice store (woo hoo) come to find out I got completely and utterly fucking *shafted* on this deal. 
I just updated my Samsung Pay app on T-Mobile and that promo didn't pop up for me. Hopefully it's not an AT&ampT exclusive. Edit: I just launched the app and I got the promo now. http://imgur.com/T9mXvAC.jpg
What provider do you have? Because I got a update a couple of days ago for my T-Mobile Note 5 specifically for Samsung Pay. 
Att. I had one at the beginning for samsung pay for the beta to get the framework but that was it.  I'll try sammobile and see if they have the update for att live thereChecked on xda and the only update anyone's talking about is the one that came last week for me. Hopefully they push the update I need so I can continue to use samsung pay.

The phone is so slim now I've taken the Otterbox off =)
Not all Visa cards are supported. The issuing bank has to opt-in. I suggest you call your bank and tell them you want to be able to use your card on Samsung Pay.
I got my code for the promo! Heads up, the wireless chargers are on backorder.
They currently support apple pay, so i didnt think they'd have an issue with sammy pay. They also block android pay.
Yes, the issuing bank has to opt-in, call your bank tomorrow and tell them you want to use your card on Samsung Pay. It might be a few weeks before some banks, credit unions allow thir cards on Samsung Pay. It uses the same provisioning system that Apple Pay and Android Pay use, so most likely banks that officially support those will end up supporting Samsung Pay.
No, just the regular wireless charger.
Oh, so not a major bank. Well the fact that they support Apple Pay can be a plus. But if they haven't added support for Android pay yet, that could be a red flag. They all use the same provisioning system, so there really is no excuse and Samsung isn't charging the banks fees like Apple. I'd call and request support for Samsung Pay, but that's no guarantee. The easiest thing to do would be to get a supported credit card and just use that for all your Samsung Pay purchases, so you don't have to change banks.
I have discover, and capital one. Both are unsupported. Really annoying that im going to be able to use it. I live in an area where we dont have major banks, just small banks.
I have no idea. Googling suggests it was an intermittent issue on the Note 4, but who knows. Maybe the Note 5's DPI is falsely flagging it as incompatible? Either way, it's ridiculous and Redbox should feel bad.
What features were deleted?  I use the S-pen and it's apps/features heavily. I couldn't live without them. Ok, technically I *could* but I wouldn't do it willingly. 
The removable battery, expandable storage and the IR Blaster. 
There are a few, s beam, WiFi direct. Etc. What I've been doing instead is using Google drive, and just sending the link to her.If you want to do it remotely, there are Google drive sync apps that'll sync any drive folder with any folder on your phone. 
If you view that image via the gallery, is it present? Do you have the issue with any other background? It's not a hardware issue since we can see it. Most likely comes from the image itself.
The top button on mine came off the first week of owning and they gave me that excuse. I phoned a couple more times and they finally just shipped me a replacement. Awful customer service.
I've heard samsung pay doesn't work with encrypted devices.
yeah I definitely had a hard time with the G4 and Note 5 at a nearby RadioShack because of the security dongle. I'm struggling with a decision still even though I've watched a ton of comparison videos, reviews, articles, etc. on both devices I like them both for different reasons and they both have what I am mainly looking for in a phone, that camera. Mainly for recording videos of puppies at work and taking pictures of random stuff. Only thing that isn't helping is the price point of the Note 5 as I would like to buy the phone fully unlocked (like Moto X/G4) but if I do decide on the Note 5 I'll just go with a carrier under a 2 year contract.What features of the Note 5 do you use the most?
Looks like I could use that until someone makes a decent battery case. The back looks like it has a nice grip but what about the sides? I *really* want a solid grip on the sides. 
Are all cables the same? Could I use the cable that came with my Galaxy S3 on my Note 5?
the stylus, camera, and Samsung Pay. Launching the camera by double pressing the home button is great.  It works even from the lock screen. 9/1times I don't miss the shot I want. 
I don't know enough to say you can use any cable, but you should be able to use any USB 2 cable. Are you having the same fast charging issue with your phone?

I was pushing 1 hour sot per 10% on my day off. I was on WiFi all day with video and browsing only, good to see the battery isn't horrible on WiFi :-).
I am having exactly the same problem and it is incredibly annoying. Everything else is fine on my network. And my speedtests are normal. But in real world usage across all internet-dependant apps I'm having to wait 10-15 seconds before I get anything other than a loading wheel. I haven't found a fix yet but I'm looking. Figure anything out yet? 
is that using Nova or a theme?
I feel like I'm being swayed from the Moto X Pure/G4 to the Note 5 because of this, it's on ebay right now for $589 factory unlocked oh boy what to do.Reasons are because that camera, and I feel like I would use Samsung Pay all the time, that beautiful display, fingerprint scanner looks nice to have, and the S-Pen features look handy. This is tough for me as you can probably tell.How is the feel in hand btw, is it really comfortable?
I've had a note 5 for a couple weeks now and I love it! I'm coming from a note 2 (I work telecom so I use many other phones as well), so almost any phone this year would've been an upgrade for me. Honestly, I would say software lag 'exists', but the phone is so damn fast that you really have to look for it for it to be a problem. Now I'm speaking for myself as a medium-ish user, so my experience may differ. My favorite phone I've ever used though, hands down.
I upgraded from a Note 4. I've seen no lag at all on the 5. Everything is smooth and works well.  I am happy with it. The only things that would improve it for me is no glass back, and bring back the SD. Oh,  and another thing, I love the wireless charging. Even using the same wireless chargers I used with my 4, the 5 charges faster. 
I came from an M8 to a Note 5 just three days ago. The idle battery life is so much greater and I don't have to force a sleep state anymore, and the screen is .7 inches larger with hardware buttons and it's all so much more gorgeous for no extra body size.There's a bit of frame drop very occasionally but it's far less than what I was expecting and on my ATT model the app package disabler pro manners to disable every single bit of bloat which is very nice and unexpectedly easy. I'd wholly recommend the upgrade. 
SD would be beneficial, thankfully it's not a big concern for me. Wireless charging seems cool. Not sure how revolutionary it is yet, but it's a cool feature. Thanks for the info!
I believe the only thing I might miss is the boom sound front facing speakers from the M8. Such good sound when watching videos.The Lollipop fiasco from HTC promising the update in 9days, but taking far longer than that really gave me a bad impression. I would rather a company state it'll take until this date than absolutely promise an earlier deadline only to miss it by a wide margin. I don't except Samsung to be much different in length to get the updates, but at least I don't have to worry about whether or not the company will exist and continue to support its devices in the relatively near future.
I upgraded to the note 5 from a galaxy s6 edge and I love it. I really liked the edge but something was missing. After getting the note, I realized the thing that was missing was the big and beautiful screen. The phone doesn't feel much bigger but watching anything on the big screen is AWESOME. Would never to back to a smaller screen and the s pen is great especially when you have write something down without unlocking your phone. Great phone. 
You can access the flashlight from the lock screen. Just put the flashlight as one of your quick setting apps and use the pull down on the lockscreen to access the app. 
no, screen on was 6h 54m like i said in another reply.
Oh you mean that software with nothing like dual window to take advantage of that big screen that is notorious for screen burn-in? Nice joke, mate. Oh but nice speakers. Lol
Does anyone use dual window?
Exact same break happened to my buddy on his Verizon version.  They replaced the entire phone with very little hassle.  
Unfortunately almost every method I've tried hasn't worked, in terms of cell standby and bluetooth. For example, here's a comparison of battery usage of my Note 5 and Note 3 left over night on the same network with the same apps for roughly the same amount of time:http://imgur.com/C6nd5Ea - Note 5http://imgur.com/syXfXmH - Note 3Both have had messenger/youtube/twitter/email notifications when I woke up.I don't know what the DT ignite is... But basically, this is me unplugging the phone before sitting down to watch some tv before I went to bed, which involves me doing some light web browsing and whatnot before heading to sleep for roughly 9 hours. If I recall, the Note 3 was at 96% before I went to sleep. Tested bluetooth again and it still would randomly skip and lag badly during play back. Most likely will be returning it in a day or two, maybe exchange or just wait for the Note 6. 
Your best bet would be to, first, do a factory reset. If that doesn't help then just wait for the marshmallow update. 
I just got the note 5 for christmas and it's the monster I expected it to be. Best Phone display, Camera(Wow), Design of 2015. If you can wait tho as the leaks of the s7 specs have come out, then get that intead. It's an upcoming beast of a phone too! Otherwise the Note 5 is your go to. Plus fast charging is the best!
How do you guys like it? I think it's leaving scuff marks on my screen... I'm waiting for my screen protector in the mail and was using this and noticing marks.. Like on the edges and to the left of the button. Anyone else have this happen?
is there any downside to fast charge?
Yep. I miss a lot about the Nexus, particularly the shape and the size of the display. But the thing just got too hot for me to use comfortably. I love the Note 5, though. It's so fast, gorgeous, amazing camera, and yes, I really like the S Pen. 
And the material is the entire product?  The actual fit, the customer service, the support...  Also Slickwraps shady tactics re: Dbrand turned me off for good.
The natural series leather is about 0.7mm. Due to the curved glass and raised lip of the Note5, the edge of the skin fits nicely against the metal border.
I never liked vanilla android... Touchwiz was crap before, it has gotten better though. just a different perspective. 
&gtThe Note 2 will not go in backwardsNeither will the 3, or the 4. The only reason the 5 goes in backward is because the nub on the end of the pen is designed to sit flush with the surface of the phone. I feel like they could have made the cap on the S-pen 1mm wider and it wouldn't fit into the silo, without any discernible difference.
Coming from last few phones with on screen button I can understand this. I really would like to home with a tap of a press. 
Except it's set to low quality and I tested the two phones just hours apart. My old Note 3 was also bad with Google Play Music, but not this bad. I'm guessing it's something with TouchWiz. I'll try Spotify.
TouchWiz is completely different on the Note 3 from the Note 5. And like I said I use Play music all day at work. 
That's debatable.. I haven't ever had good experiences with getting the iPhone color and size that I want day one, let alone month one.. 
I understand that. I think my point is they probably were available. IPhone being popular could be reason you didn't get color,  size you wanted on day 1. Thing with Samsung / Android  dealing with colors and models from my experience only certain carriers will have and if you're not on that carrier your screwed. 
No your right, I'm just trying to play the other side of the coin. It is pretty frustrating.. If that's the color I wanted I'd be pretty mad. 
There are tweeks out there that'll help with the issue, but it requires root. Unfortunately, you can't root an att note 5. So unless Samsung and att issues an update to address this issue, you're out of luck. 
Drop test are stupid. Yeah, it glass, it's going to break. 
Right on and yeah I'm frustrated because I really wanted that color. Me being on Verizon I only had 1 choice which was black/bluish one, only 64gig model verizon decided we needed. Such bs 
OK I thought it was just me but I knew something was afoot when my game kept closing and not updating. This is annoying. 
My friend was able to do it on my galaxy s6 two weeks ago and they sent him an email to verify the card. But I'm not even sure they still do that.
I'm also impatient though and called in. I probably would have gotten the email at some point.
because lollipop makes this phone chow the fuck down on battery power. 
32 gb versi??n here. I have about 6gb left. I sync pictures with Google. I have a few gigs of music and three movies, which is about 8 gb. I'm not worried about the storage, I could always delete stuff if needed. The movies I switch with others all the time so I don't ever really have the same ones. 
Yup, Apple Pay has to be set up to work with credit card machines...Samsung Pay can be used by ANY credit card machine that swipes.
That's pretty weird, you don't need to even call them. Do you have mobile banking setup with your phone number etc?
Sorry for the late reply. The audio is definitely more clear and also louder than the Note 4. I say it is a 15%-20% improvement, which is good enough for my needs. Bluetooth audio also seems louder and more clear.
Also, you have to enable the higher quality sampling under settings to take advantage.
Can confirm what /u/Pcriz said. It's for the samsung pay update. Just a minor patch to be up to date with the security measures SP needs to operate with. If you adopt Samsung Pay and register your BoA or USBank cards, you get a free wireless charger!
Same exact thing happened to me /u/Mason12947. A samsung rep messaged me privately about the firmware update on AT&ampT not pushing with the SP update and I messaged him about it, not knowing the stuff got fixed. Gonna have to try it out now since others are reporting it's working now.
You know I noticed this before on my Note 3. When my battery hit 20% the 4G was just constantly showing despite being on WiFi. Seems counter productive, especially when my battery was already so low. 
Yeah I'm getting it right now at 56% battery
I purchased the gold version as well. But, no big deal for me since I wasn't planning to use Samsung Pay.
I'd noticed this yesterday. Very annoying because I'm not sure if it's really using 4G for something or not.  I think snapchat actually has permissions for location now.  :/ 
I don??t own the note 5 (yet), but perhaps it??s the smart wifi feature? There was a video unboxing/review by detroitBorg I think (on mobile right now so I can??t link), and he mentions the smart wifi feature in the wifi settings. It switches between wifi and data when your wifi connection is spotty.
Yeah snapchat does, that's how we use the geotags
Wells Fargo says they are always exploring new options for mobile wallets  and will keep us posted 
Did you not ask why it uses 4g when WiFi is connected? It's not necessary. But it still does it constantly. 
If I were you I would double check every thing you've disabled. Some useful packages are marked as bloatware, such as the package that allows you to change window size when multitasking.Ninja edit : Are you using anything anything else that might effect packages? I had an issue with screen off memo when I first installed Doze (the app) 
Here's the official, which is a little different than you described. Good luck.Galaxy Note 5 Unresponsive FixPress and Hold the Power Button and the Volume Down Button at the Same timeContinue Holding These Buttons for at Least Seven SecondsAfter Seven Seconds, or More, the Galaxy Note 5 Should RebootOnce the Galaxy Note 5 Reboots, Let Go of These Two Buttons
I can get the need for wanting to see media volume to ensure the level it's at, but do you actually need to see it, or do you just need to make sure it doesn't start blasting if you launch an app?Though it won't be visual, you could try using Tasker to auto set your media volume.  You can leave it at 0, and when when launching Pandora, or whatever, you can have it adjust automatically to 2 or 3 or whatever.
Not sure about the NFC,  but Zerolemon faced complaints over its S6 battery case. Google it up. 
Try redoing the fingerprints registrared.
I rooted my note 5 for a day or two, improvements didn't seem worth the tradeoffs, touchwiz is already an improvement over stock IMO, slap a nice theme on with PDP and you're set.
This is great advice, thank you!
How thick does TouchWiz feel compared to stock?Other than S pen, what does the note do better? The 6P?If it weren't for the s pen, which phone would you say is better?Edit: and why for each of those Qs.Edit Edit: a space
oh, hm.talking about the camera hole though

Not to call everyone a liar,  but I work at a repair shop and have personally disassembled and replaced the LCD on a note 5. There are parts on Ebay as well,  I've ordered one for my mother's phone. It's really just a matter of finding a repair shop comfortable with the repair to be quite honest. That note 5 was not fun. It was super stressful and would never willingly repair one again.  Lol. Edit: also for what it's worth I think we are one of two shops that does current gen Samsung work,  out of the 8 or so in the city 
don't know why you are getting down voted.  it is bloated as fuck.  I think i will move to Windows phone next.  
Having same issue, if it let go under 15% phone either won't turn on until I plug it back in and will instantly say 15% or more immediately after meaning I still had battery... Smh Feels like I may have a dud... 
Thanks guys and after searching I found two things I like even better in multi action home button and corner swipe. Multi action home button may have same problem with double tap but has a few other shortcut options. Also probably gonna get a swipe up shortcut and I'm now using simple buttons I think it's called to put soft buttons on right side middle screen so I don't have to reach to bottom all the time. I currently have a note 3 and will get a g7 or note 6 if they have sd card and still have 64gb internal
I've never used a case before and I plan on grabbing a case soon for my Note 5. The thing is amazingly slippery thanks to all the glass and aluminum sides.
It is a sexy device, but its a finger print magnet. That and given its made of glass I'd be cautious. Having said that, if you want a case, Verus makes some amazing cases that are not bulky. If you still want the naked feel, invest in a leather sleeve and carry on. Protected on the move and naked when in use. 
You mean that the text, icons and drawn lines in the screen off menu on your phone are white? Mine are white too. As far as I know, you can't change the colour of the screen off memo.The only reason the text and lines in the video look blue is because everything in the video is tinted blue. In fact, the white face of the Note 5 in the video is the same tone of blue as the text on the screen.
Oooo. Then the black prong sensor that indicates when the pen is taken out, probably dosent work. 
How about the samsung warranty? Or just trying to return it for it being defective? I know, morally, you shouldn't do this kind of stuff, but hey, maybe it's worth a try?
Same except just the S-Pen.  Mine broke off inside the phone.  They replaced mine under warranty.  
Nova launcher prime, lines free icon pack and the dashclock widget for my clock/weather/notifications 
I buy almost all my cables (USB, HDMI, ethernet, speakerwire, etc.) off of Monoprice. They've generally worked really well for me and are inexpensive.
Hey, if you enable verbose WiFi logging in the Dev settings it will show you 518as the frequency. By the speed, my guess is you are connected at 2.4
I'm not sure, but it's not a custom ROM. My note 5 is a 64gb unlocked one.
It's not touchwiz, it's the Exynos SoC. The Note 2 had the same problem. Your S5 was most likely the Snapdragon variant, same as my Note 4. Samsung tweaks its processors to enter a 'dormant' state when the screen is off (all  processors do this but Samsung takes it to an extreme), and when you press the power button it slowly ramps up the clock speed. This is why there is a lag between pressing the button and the screen actually turning on (something you probably didn't have on your S5, either) and the stutters that we experience too. My Note 4 didn't have this issue, but overall performance on the Note 5 is leagues ahead.
Here's the specs for the adapter I used: Input100-240V- 50/60Hz 0.5A Output 5.0V 2.4AThe specs for the default Samsung fast charger: input 100-240V-50/60Hz 0.50AOutput 9.0V 1.87A OR  5.0V 2.0A. So my the adapter I used should have had no issue charging the phone. You shouldn't NEED the fast charger... 
Mirror cases might mess with the reception of the phone and NFC/LoopPay/wireless charging due to the metal used to make the mirror finish. 
I don't use Snapchat and I have YouTube Red, so these are both worthless.
Minminguard, xposed torch, activityforcenewtaskMinminguard blocks ads, and deletes the empty space they would have left behind.  Everyone has a flashlight app already but I like this xposed one because it activates while holding down Volume Up while the screen is off.  Activityforcenewtask makes it so apps can't open other apps inside their own task. Which interferes with switching by use of the recent apps screen, or sometimes by hitting back. 
I've removed all but one cleaning app (CCleaner I don't even have Greenify anymore).  My phone can last all day with medium usage.  I guess it's like I was told (sometimes rudely), cleaning apps don't help and might even hurt.  Clean Master seems so trashy to me, I don't even want it on my phone.   
Try taking a video, including the IMEI of the phone, and see if you can get it to happen. Then maybe someone at the carrier store will believe you? It's a PITA but this is a really frustrating situation and I hope you get it resolved. I completely agree that sending it in is just going to get you charged for the tech's time when they don't find anything.I wonder if this relates to why my Note 5 started randomly boot looping last night while it was just sitting on my desk. Phone fried itself. I guess I got lucky that it became totally unresponsive. I feel like I'm reading more about issues like this recently, like there's a hardware fault that is starting to show up a few months after manufacture. Probably just my imagination though.
Just tried it. No difference. I assume the s voice is enabled by double clicking the home button and that's why some have fixed it by disabling s voice. My double click home button launched the camera. Oh well. Using the back button to exit an app is much quicker and more fluid. Sadly if I'm multiple pages in an app it'll go all the way back to the original page. Anyways, appreciate the help.
The screen was not on
I get 4 hours. No package disabler or anything.I do however turn off a lot of useless stuff like Location. and the brightness on medium.Using a darker theme/wallpaper helps out too.
Both wired fast charging and the wireless fast charger require 9V/1.67A (15W) input. If your cable isn't fast charging your phone then it won't supply the wireless fast charger with enough power  and you'll only get normal wireless charging.I have 2 fast wireless charging pads and replaced the cables on both with monoprice 28/24AWG cables and I have no issues with fast wireless charging.
Same here. 64gb Note 5 Verizon. I just got a replacement one this week. Mine was doing the exact same thing you described. At first they told me it was ZEDGE....told me to remove it &amp wait a week. I knew it wasn't it but so I could show them that wasn't it, I did it. Next they replaced my sim card. That didn't fix it either. So they told me to call customer service. After about 30mins explaining the situation they sent me a replacement model. Wife has the 32gb model with no issues. 
This app optimization totally sucks. Keeps prompting over and over again
I have the S6 and it records loud thumping bass extraordinarily well.You can even look at some videos on Youtube. They have the same mic.
even clicked out, there is still a small tug that needs to be applied to get the s-pen out. there is something that catches it, my guess around the dark grey part with 'samsung' inscribed on it, as that is the largest part of the pen. 
Just a guess. But GPSD is probably GPS daemon. Are you using maps or anything else that would need GPS? If not I would just turn off the GPS completely and see if that helps the battery.  Though tbh if you're getting 10h with the drain I'd say that's pretty good life. I don't get anywhere near that with my phone.Edit: stupid autocorrect. 
Too thin and slippery for me. I have difficulty picking it up off the table and if I dropped it and it broke/cracked while it *didn't* have a case...I'd feel like an idiot.Dude it was *sooooo* expensive, even with a 2 year contract...
Question, do you keep your battery saver mode on or without battery saver mode on when using your phone? Without battery saver my phone drains completely in under 3 hours.. Also, can you screenshot your disabled package from Package Disabler?
Is anyone else getting terrible halo with Zagg? I'm on my second one now and I've got a good 2mm halo all around the whole screen. 
I do it. Tempered glass screen protector only. EXCEPT  at the gym. At the gym, I use a spigen clear tpu case. My reasoning is that with sweat, I might drop it, or it might slip out of my gym shorts while using weight machines.Otherwise, lots of naked fun. ) 
Sounds like your s5 has seen better days. I made the jump from the s5 to the note 5 and I can say I was happy I did. I did get it on a sale price though, because it's not worth forking over hundreds of dollars even on contract I find. If you can get a good deal, go for it. I use the s pen a lot at school and at the gym, and I'm loving the extra screen space. I also got the gear VR so I'm loving that I chose the note over the s6. I will say though, although the battery is supposed to be great, it's only really impressive when the screen is off, when the screen is on it eats more battery than the s5 (for me at least. My s5 battery was incredible). I'm assuming it's because of of the 2k screen. All in all, you shouldn't be disappointed if you get a note 5 now. 
They are the same across variants.
The Samsung Keyboard is basically the Swiftkey keyboard from what I noticed. 
I don't do anything on my phone except use web Facebook instead of the FB app. I get 6 hours SOT easily throughout the day. Oh yeah and the stock optimizations T-Mobile did on the Note 5 for battery life ate amazing.

Fingerprints.Shot out to that old ass dachshund, just kickin it.
The only 4 that show up for me are:Package Disabler Pro (On)Android Pay (Off)Android Device Manager (Off) Nova Launcher (Off).And even with PDP off, I am still unable to change it after rebooting.
Battery degradation is function of drain percentage, number of cycles, discharge rate, and recharge rate (fast charging is actually harder on the battery, not sure if it's significant though). Going to 0% is really hard on the batteries though.
Thanks for the heads up man.  I have a friend on T-Mobile with his Note 5 and he is getting awesome battery life.  Yeah VZW messed up something with this device.
Maybe clean your catches? But you have to turn Doze off and on again. A clean phone is a happy phone. 
Mine might be an isolated issue but it's been scratching small parts of my screen. Idk if stuff gets in between the case and screen and when it's in my pocket causes the scratches.. but other than that love the case.
Power home doesn't work for me 
Maybe due to the encryption? 
Tried this and it didn't work for me. Also tried factory reset and an Odin flash. Seems like a hardware issue for me and I'm waiting for a replacement in the mail.Here's a big thread with other people experiencing Bluetooth issues: http://forums.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-note-5/570201-note-5-bluetooth-issue.html
I'm extremely glad other people are having the same problem. Really thought my deteriorating sanity was manifesting itself into wooshes and bleeps in my music. Will try CBR instead of VBR. Thank you to everyone in this thread. 
I think package disabler pro had an overall negative impact on my battery and performance.
yep definitely good at photos which helps.
I just really wish I could use sidesync 
I don't think so. Imagine if the sensor is on all the time, it might be a big battery drain. 
I've gotten up to slightly more than 5 hours.   I don't usually need to use 5 hours, but I've gotten there a few times.  I don't have any type of package disabler.  The only thing I have is CCleaner.  Bluetooth is always on as well as the Power-saving Location service.  I rarely use Wi-Fi (unlimited data plan).   Screen Brightness is on Automatic.I did disable much of the bloatware that came with the phone (Verizon). The FB app is definitely disabled.  
I'm going all natural, no case, no screen protector.
Yes, I had this issue. Try disabling WhatsApp. That solved the problem for me.
Does the leather skin make the back flush with the camera module now?Looks great, btw!
No. It needs to have a default set for tap and pay. If you didn't have a default, the phone would have no way of knowing which app to use. 
Is it on fast charge?
I'm on snapchat version 9.15.0.which is the latest version listed on the play website, I think it only updated today (Australia).What are the new features? I noticed I got a trophy today, I've not noticed it before but that doesn't mean it's new...
I had the note 3 and I loved the fact that it had a removable battery and microSD slot. But I only had one battery and only one SD that was never used. Honestly, I don't miss those. But I have to say, the note 5 has the most hideous back. Not sure why everyone is praising it. For once I want a case to hide it. I wouldn't say I'd rather have the note 3's plastic rear cover but it was pretty cool being able to replace that with their S-view case to make it more slim than having a full case over that. 
Yeah. You can customize within their limits. But try to gain full control and you flip the Knox and lose access to other stuff. Most of us don't want the customization crap... we just want stock Android but that's too much to ask for :[
Yep, was dumbfounded. For some reason I never read the update log. I wanted to know how to use it. I figured it had to do with something about the for new phones only. The trophies show up but not the lenses.

I already placed an order for the phone so now I'm a bit afraid. I could go without WiFi calling, but what is VoLTE?
Supposedly Mophie should be designing a battery case for the note, nothing on the website yet. 
2 amp wouldn't make it the fast charge is it.
Yep, I updated yesterday to try and set up Samsung Pay to get the free charger.  None of my credit cards were supported and now I have this random reboot issue.  Hooray.
No, that's a standard charge.  Fast charge is the higher voltage at slightly lower current
15 day is the return policy from Verizon, phone has a1 year warranty.  As others have said, take it to Verizon, admit nothing other than it's not working correctly.  They should fix it
I know this is a late comment, but do you find it adds any grip in comparison to the glass back?
I updated to get Samsung Pay working. I think I saw it reboot once but haven't seen it do it again yet. Phone is running smoothly otherwise.
So it definitely affects the fast charger therefore I feel it will affect samsung pay as well, I moved the metal plate down on the phone to the bottom and that fixed the issue like /u/Mxbzz suggested. I will probably have to move my car mount a little to compensate for the different location of the magnet but hopefully won't be an issue. I am assuming if Wireless charging works than Samsung pay will as well
Yeah, but they just stopped throttling like a month ago. Also, their data speeds suck. And wifi calling is kind of a band aid for having terrible coverage. Just saying. There's a reason they have to buy out contracts, and it's not because they're a bunch of good guys. 
Well AT&ampT and Verizon still throttle.  My work phone is an AT&ampT iPhone 6 and I can tell you for certain that towards the end of the month my data speeds are significantly slower.    Haven't had any issue with wifi calling.  Band aid or not, it works.  AT&ampT only has 1 bar at my home too and with wifi calling on Sprint I never have to worry about dropping a call.  
I have a Note 5 and I've got no complaints.  If TouchWiz is slowing this thing down then I'm not seeing it.  Best screen on the market IMO and it's not even all that close (but, I'm one who loves the exaggerated pop of the colors, I know some don't).  My battery life is fine: I very easily get through a normal day and I rarely have below 30% after 24 hours off the charger... SOT averages about 4 hours, and that's keeping everything turned on all the time.TouchWiz to me isn't a problem... firstly, TouchWiz the launcher is actually pretty good these days, though I still use Nova just because it's more feature-rich.  As for the embellishments on the notification shade and settings, it's definitely a matter of preference but I actually like them more than my stock Nexus 7.  Hell, I even kind of like Sammy's Calendar app better than stock (though I prefer the stock Clock app).  Anyway, easy enough to swap those apps out.  And, I like a lot of the extra features Samsung gives me (I'm even pissed about them dropping one or two from the S5 - being able to wave to change music tracks when in the car was handy)The camera is of course fantastic and we all know the build quality is top-notch (not being waterproof like my S5 still bugs me though, I gotta be honest... I'd take plastic back in a heartbeat if I could have that).  Non-swappable battery?  Doesn't bother me personally... no SD slot?  Does kinda suck since I've had one for a few years now, but with 64Gb I've basically made due without any  big sacrifices.Basically, I've got no complaints about my Note 5.  It works like it should and does everything I want.But, of course, the elephant in the room is updates.Now, to be fair, I'm on T-Mobile, and they're probably the best for updates... but, there's still obviously going to be a lag between when stock devices get them and when I do... and, there's the idea of when will Samsung decide not to provide updates anymore.  But, in my experience, updates come on T-Mobile from Samsung without unreasonable delay and Samsung hasn't been too bad supporting devices... they at least support them long enough for me to get a new device, typically about two years.But, if very timely updates are a big concern then the 6P is the right choice.  If you prefer stock Android, 6P is the right choice.  In fact, just based on what we've seen online, the 6P looks like a damned fine phone period.If I was making my choice today, I'd still go with the Note 5, but it wouldn't be by a lot, that's for sure.  And if I thought T-Mobile or Samsung was going to drag their feet with updates that might be enough to change my mind... in fact, if I was a Verizon customer I suspect I WOULD go with the 6P, for example.
AT&ampT throttles at 20GB for people still on the expired unlimited plans. So does wifi calling on sprint have a handover feature? Like will it switch to wifi from cellular during a call without dropping? I've never used it and I'm curious. 
I bought one from the verizon store and it would charge for 5 minutes then just stop, returned it the next day
Between the Note 5 and the Note 4, I prefer the Note 5. I've never used am SD card, had one or two cases in which I used a spare battery (though it wasn't necessary), and forgot the Note 4 even had an IR blaster while I had the phone. The Note 4 has a better dev scene at the moment, and I did love flashing new ROMs, but the Note 5 works so well that I barely even feel the desire to root. If they can figure a way to make Samsung Pay work with a rooted phone, I will, but I can wait patiently until then. 
I've tried the following* Swiftkey* Swype* Google Keyboard* Samsung KeyboardCurrently I'm using Swype and it's pretty nice.  The accuracy is unmatched and they finally have a nice material design theme.  The Google keyboard lacked long press for special characters and Swiftkey flow doesn't work on the lockscreen. 
Same model, UAE Dubai, still no update.
Thanks for the heads up. I don't use samsung pay, and wireless charging isn't terribly important to me. I guess another bonus to having the metal plate on the case is that I can just take it off when I need those features. 
Any decent tape would work. The tape is used more for a protector to not scratch the back glass. 
I just disabled what could be disabled that I don't think I'd use or is bloat. All from the applications manager. Didn't use the package disabler.
A reboot made it work for me.After that it showed up as an update if I remember right.
FYI, the screenshots were taken about 34 seconds apart. (Check my math, Archimedes ???) On the other hand my phone also plummeted from 43% to about 14%, and soon after,  it died.
I'm also looking at buying one in the EU (UK specifically on the Three network) so would be interested in this advice also.Also I can't see any difference's between the Dual Sim and Single sim versions?
I noticed this last night, but I also noticed it looks waaaayyyy worse when you're looking and about to take a picture than it does after you actually take the picture. 
Anyone here use slide for Reddit? Is it only me or does the app lag a lot when scrolling? 
I have the Tmobile version and I actually get really good battery life. I can't report any Bluetooth issues though. I know in recent versions of android it is absolutely terrible in managing location services so I would try toggling that off and it should help. Also Google Apps seem to be power suckers in general so that may  also contribute to it. Let us know if any of the suggestions work! 
My photo was 3.53 MB and it did the same thing you're describing. I was going to wait until Monday and see if I got an email, and if not I am going to contact them. This is something I don't want to miss out on, I'm thinking about the gear S2
Just wanted to add myself to this thread as its been driving me nuts on my S6.  Guy Fieri eating noodles in reverse is good slow, but it's better at normal speed of course. 
I think having [almost nothing](http://imgur.com/4LJJGBW) on the home screen is about as simplistic as it gets.Edit: just Nova Prime.Edit2: Also, SwitchUI for the icon pack.
Thanks. I also get it with Swiftkey, or the Samsung Keyboard though :(
Oh I forgot, I accidentally activated ultrapowersaving mode when I have some disabled apps. It bricked my phone so I had to use odin to get my phone working.So basically, a factory reset, then pdp fixed my 4hr SOT.I don't use any of that power saving shit now.
I get that too. I just close the messenger app and the problem goes away. 
I did that too...my problem is that i dont receive push notifications from chrome but only for messages...i cant fknd a solution...
Try easy home from the play store. It works like 90% of the time and you can set app exceptions so you don't go out of Netflix or something.
I'm getting ready to move over to a nexus 5x. But samsung pay will be the only thing I will miss, especially since in the US everywhere is moving over to the annoying chip. I can bypass all that crap with my phone. I'll have android pay, but samsung pay worked with every terminal. It mimics the magnets on a credit card so everything can use it. Even when the clerks were always telling me their registers don't accept phone pay I would still use it and they'd be shocked. The fingerprint scanner was inconsistent for me, sometimes I can get in on the first try but other times I get blocked out of using my fingerprint from so many trials. It was so annoying I ended up going back to the original android pattern lock. 
That was what bugged me the most about the note. All that power and still lags. I'm back on the 6p while wanting for marshmallow on the note 
I personally use the AMOLED Cinema. The Basic looks very yellow-ish to me, even when compared to my iPad and PC.
I have the Spigen Wallet case and its good and works well, not real leather and does break down quickly but gives another protective layer to your screen. Phone snaps in well (hard to get out). Wallet part doesn't close amazingly over screen especially with a few bills and cards but oh well. Seems a little lose in terms of the clip couldve been tighter although I think this is so you can fill it to the brim but the hinge side isn't huge so its sorta lopsided and not parallel. 
I switched from iPhone 6 plus to the edge+ and now to the note 5 and I don't regret it, but I knew what I was getting myself into. It's not my first android, if this is your first Android and are doing it for the android open experience then stay the hell away from Samsung. You can do much more on a jailbroken iphone than you can only a Samsung. You won't be able to do any of the cool rooted stuff if you're on at&ampt/Verizon or if you want to be able to use samsung pay. That also will void your warranty from Samsung. But if you want the s-pen then there is no better phone. 
I had a look and can't find any differences.The black one that australia offers is beautful and looks dark navy blue but if you try to get one internationally get a 64GB too.
Basically the same phone. I moved from the iPhone 6 to the note 5 and there were more things that I could do on the iPhone 6 since it was jailbroken and my note 5 is through at&ampt. Also, jailbreak let's you still use apple pay so that was a huge plus too. But honestly I just want the s-pen so I'm okay being trapped with samsung. It's unfortunate that I can't do the things that I should be able to through android, but that's samsung. 
I can't believe I missed the shit about Knox when I bought this. I thought, if the battery sucks that bad I'll just root and spend an afternoon fixing it. Ha-ha! Nope! 12 hours of battery, 2 hours SOT because my WiFi won't shut the fuck off and the screen on anything other than so dim you can't tell how the photo you just took looks, it sucks down battery fast enough to negate a USB charger and slow a fast charge to 14%/hr gain. Fuck Samsung and really fuck Verizon. I love that they are somehow cheaper than sprint and have better coverage but for 80fucking dollars id like to be able to use my phone without literally neutering every feature and app. 
I'm with LG U+ in South Korea. Few things are different here. We have VoLTE, video calling, and if you look closely you can see I'm connected to both WiFi and LTE networks at the same time for what the consider LTE 5G here. Really it's just multipath connection but I can pull some serious speeds! 
Adaway if you're rootedAdguard if you're notAlso, you could have googled Galaxy Note 5 Block Ads and found your answer.
Try using package disabler from the app store. Luckily it doesn't need root, and it gets me 4-6 hours SOT which is pretty good.
I bought it, it doesn't work. If I don't set the wifi to off completely, it stays on no matter what. And somehow, using WiFi gets me a discharge rate of fucking 800mA (!!) for a minute or so at a time. It's fucking absurd, like borderline (I'm gonna go pay a restocking fee) absurd. I love this phone, the size, the s-pen, the speed, the camera, but it's got me conditioned to be afraid to use all the features for fear of having to go park next to a charger for a couple hours. 
Apparently there's a [wireless battery case coming out soon](http://forum.xda-developers.com/note5/accessories/wireless-battery-pack-case-samsung-t3195459)? But it somehow covers the camera lens. Can't wait for Zerolemon and others to come up with a proper one that *doesn't* cover the camera! 
Not the edge plus bud, just the edge
Have you changed the Always Allow Scanning settings. You can also use Tasker to automatically switch WiFi on or off when you're away from home. Like most people I see in this subreddit, I consistently get 5 or 6 hours of SOT over 18 hours by managing it WiFi settings this way. 
not regretting it at all, imo the glass gives it a better grip especially when there's sweet on my hands. touchwiz is actually good for once. and the display speaks for itself. battery life is about the same, till you turn powersave mode on  and turn location off, last me a good 12 hours with bluetooth on all day running spotify. even with losing the ir blaster and sd card from the note 4 this is a pretty dope phone  
Does the sprint version have a sim tray?
Me! Just today actually. Haha. I came from an iPhone 6 though, not a Plus. But really, I feel like it's such a huge upgrade. The screen and camera is amazing. The battery is a loooot better. And those extra features, man. Gotta love 'em. I'm still getting used to the Android though. I've been on iPhones for a while now and the switch is a lil bit confusing. But yeah, I'll get used to it.
I just switched from an iPhone 6 to the galaxy note 5 and I'm very happy with it. The amoled screen makes a huge difference for me,  and I like the overall feel of Android a lot better. The switch from iOS to android wasn't too hard,  but make sure to turn off imessage! 
It sounds like you may have had gotten a bad unit. Additionally, Verizon probably has some kind of app that manages your WiFi. I know that T-Mobile does and you have to go in and turn it off or else it keeps turning WiFi on to save data.I'm totally unrooted, I leave my brightness on auto, used Package Manager to disable some bloat (not even enough to trip up updates as the last three updates went off without a hitch), and Tasker to disable my WiFi when I'm not at either home, school, or work. With all of that, I'm pushing 4-6 hours of SoT, depending on what I'm doing when the screen is on, and 16-2hours total battery time. I carry my charger around just because I'm weird with the battery percentages, but most days I make it through an entire day. When I'm at school, I use my note to take all of my class notes, so the screen is on quite a bit.Have you disabled Voice over LTE? The feature is hardly noticeable when on or off and it causes a pretty big battery drain due to a bug in Android in general. Could you maybe post some screenshots of your battery stats? I'd love to help figure out what's going on and see if we can help get your device running smooth. 
Would you happen to have a picture of that on the phone? The pictures definitely make it look like a super bulky case, so now I'm curious. I personally have the Spigen Neo Hybrid Carbon case and I actually really love it. I've dropped it twice from about four feet onto asphalt and the case only has a small mark that looks like paint rubbed off. The phone, though, has literally zero damage and the screen protected I have (Zagg tempered glass) didn't break. Overall, I dig this case.
Hey OP, I just made headway with debloating my new phone as well. Check some progress pics on [my thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxynote5/comments/41061l/day_2_cpu_in_deep_sleep_but_power_graph_still/).Recent stuff I used Package Disabler on were wfdbroker and thememanager. I uninstalled all of my task managers and auto-killers too.
The shortcuts are what keep me on Swype. It's so efficient to be able to cut, copy, paste, and select all text directly from the keyboard. I have no idea why other keyboards don't implement this. I'd probably switch if they did because there are other aspects of Swype I can't stand.
Theme and/or font? Looks really cool.
Yep. Same thing. LOVE the phone but with certain themes seemed to slow down. Keyboard too. Standard theme and everything is speedier again. 
that's beautiful!I fucking love the camera on this thing. It has probably been its best feature for me. Whenever I'm out with a group of friends, everyone insists I should take the pictures for obvious reasons! 
I disabled fb last week after I read that tip. Gave it a good 5 days and have to conclude it literally did nothing for my stand by or screen on time. I always get very consistent numbers (5 hour sot) and absolutely nothing changed. I've reinstalled it. 
Yup. My last skin was a genuine leather from slickwraps, which I absolutely loved but unfortunately, it was too thick and I couldn't fit my phone in my Gear VR. I ordered a DBrand skin this time so that I could compare and it's very nice but not perfect. I'll get over it though :) If you are super curious, I can post a pic. 
I can't comment on the battery issue (I have the AT&ampT branded variant, no complaints re: battery), but I *can* say I've had exactly zero issues with Bluetooth. I have multiple devices paired to my phone (I just actually looked, and it's three pairs of BT headphones, three smartwatches, a wall-mounted speaker, and a soundbar -- plus my laptop) that I use constantly and haven't had an issue with connection strength or reliability. It might be worth contacting Verizon or Samsung to see if you might have a faulty device. (As for waiting for the Note 6, you still have 6-8 months to go for that one, so it'd be a while.)
Galaxy apps has SwiftKey for free and I recommend buying Package Disabler pro (samsung) really increases the battery life.  I'd you have any specific questions I came from iPhone 5s on December 18th. 
Is it something [like this?](http://imgur.com/gh2II27) If yes, then yeah you're a victim of shit software. Edit: It's a deepsleep issue that some devs at xda are trying to find a fix for. 
My Note 5 is the T-Mobile variant so it isn't too far off from yours. My home button and double tapping operate the same way, getting the camera, which I find very convenient. All the voice applications operate by holding it down once.I'm sorry the solution isn't showing itself but you might need to just factory reset and start over, perhaps then your problems will stop. 
Where are you getting this information? Just personal experience? Because FYI, wireless charging absolutely heats up the battery as it is inherent to the nature of how inductive coupling works. I'm looking for a more technical response.
I'm having the same issue. For me, its happening when there is no cable in at all. Just vibrates in my pocket. I took a qtip and some rubbing alcohol and did tired the nes cartidage fix and it seemed to work. No issues yet. 
I have both phones. I like the note for the smaller foot print. Screen is closed to the glass so it looks like the image is printed on. Better battery life. And build quality. But the note does lag more in terms of ui smoothness and the front camera is worst. Also I am not a fan of the way touch wiz look. I like the nexus because of new software and it's much smoother. What I don't like is the larger physical size and the huge bezels. Also the phone isn't that durable. I baby mine and already after only one and a half months the paint already started to chip off. I also don't like how the buttons are so soft and easily triggered. Also the nexus runs warmer most of the time vs the note and I did notice throttling during gaming. And I don't notice throttling on the note but do notice it on the nexus 
I just got the edge plus. I was in the same dilemma as you. I have a note 3 now but I never use the s pen. I bought the edge because I like the curves. Very sexy and eye popping. I also feel like I'll use the edge features like the contacts and favorites apps more so than I would use the s pen. I was also concerned with the comfort. It is true that the edge plus isn't as comfy to hold as the note 5. But I always put a case on my phone. Once you put a slim case in the phone it's just as comfortable as the note. If you feel like shelling out some extra cash for a unique looking phone, it's worth it. I got the gold platinum color. I'm so stoked to use it! Waiting for it to ship in as we speak. 
Is smart network switch on or off?
You are out of luck. As of right now, Verizon is blocking the installation of Samsung Pay. 
I've added the calculator shortcut, and now it's an easy way to access the calculator immediately.The text input is also fantastic, once you learn it's little quirks. 
Make absolutely sure that you get the right Samsung charger. I asked for a Samsung fast wireless charger for the Note 5 and Rogers gave me the regular one for the same cost and of course, it was the wrong one.
Not sure if tylt is a true fast wireless charger but I just got one and it does charge quite fast.http://www.tylt.com/vu-wireless-chargerGreat desktop charger
I have a VZW note 5:* It does not look like the facebook app can be uninstalled by default. That said I have yet to open it or give it any login data and my phones features all work just fine. The app does take about 230mb so that is a bit annoying but not a blocker at least for me. Also my VZW HTC and LGs were the same way.* VZ Navigator being unreliable when giving it certain store or service names. If it cannot find what you are looking for in a town it will some times give you some kind of default address in that town which is often a residence. Not sure why this happens and it is honestly my biggest pet peeve about the phone though I bet the andriod VZ works pretty much the same on all the andriod phones. Fortunately there are many GPS applications both paid and free to choose from and unlike older versions I am actually able to install and use those alternatives which is nice.* Perhaps this is just me, I feel like I could do more with Siri and Cortana's voice command sets, OK Google works well but does not seem to support most of the features I am used to though I might just need to play with it more I normally just use it to open apps.
I was too lazy to provide links, but I remembered I had seen  youtube videos a couple of months ago.
why is your camera hole a little weird at picture 4
I use Samsung Pay daily. Especially if I am just going to work, I leave my wallet at home and exclusively just use my phone to pay for things. Hopefully we can have root that does not trip KNOX soon.
Mine keeps saying invalid IMEI or MAC address.
Darthstalker runs a bit better for me. Tekhd is the only other ROM I like, but he's added way too many mods for my liking. 
I dunno...maybe they're in a rush or are super tired and having a brain fog day  (i know i do stupid mistakes when tired).These days for me,  i never really use the pen after it got stuck going in the right way :/Luckily i got it out
Be very careful with Package Disabler. It can and will break parts of the OS if given a chance. Read up on it before using it. E: Not sure why the downvotes. My statement is true. A cursory search of this subreddit alone will yield results of Package Disabler being used unwisely and resulting in loss of function. I had no idea that Be very careful was at all controversial. *shrug*
I mean it makes it damn near unusable so yea it bugs me lol.thanks for suggestion but i try to steer clear of third party social apps and don't love the fenix interface
now if i can just figure out what is making my widgets freeze while using the Google now launcher
People on xda are saying it's the update for video calling. Now I cannot confirm this, but I have also noticed that my wireless charger is working alot better after the update but it could just be me imagining things...
Sadly none of the banks down here in Hawaii support samsung pay yet...just gotta wait it out for me...
I already had video calling and I just got the same update. 
Wow, that's gorgeous. I've been wanting to try a skin like that, but I have a hard enough time with screen protectors, I can't imagine these skins would be any easier to put on. 
I've been washing my hands much more frequently since I bought the Note 5, every time I see the back I feel disgusted. Love the skin. No more grease and fingerprints! I honestly only use a case to not have to touch the slimy back and see the horror my hands leave behind after a single touch. 
Be very careful, I was installing my skin. Did all the prep and had the phone off for a couple hours and I still fried my USB port on my note 5 :( 
I didn't want to do anything to make my phone bigger so I picked up a Skiva PowerVault, it's a 2650mAh battery not quite keychain-sized but smaller than the typical smartphone-sized 5000-6000mAh packs I already have. I figure on a day with heavy usage, if I'm down to 20-30% by mid-day then I can use the power pack to bring myself back up toward full at least to get through the day. It has its own cable for Android and iOS, which is nice (and a full sized usb to recharge anywhere), though it's still a bit bigger than I'd like. I really wish someone would make something like this with just 1500mAh or so - enough to get you through an emergency but small enough that you really could stick it on a keychain and not think about it.
I've been looking for a dry application one but they're hard to find and most come with a set of 3 front and one back. I have plenty of front ones so don't feel like wasting money on money just to get one for the back. I've always stayed away from wet ones. 
Loving this case, it's absolutely perfect. I actually let someone else hold my phone last week because I knew they were very unlikely to drop it given the grip on that case. I just wish they'd bevel the bottom holes a bit - I use my little finger to hold the phone from that end and the edges of the cutouts are sharp. I may have to take a razor blade to it.
I think you're not selecting two apps. If I hit the recent apps button and tap the split screen icon on the email app, the email app moves up to the top half of the screen, no white dot, and the carousel of other active choices (which is also a slider to other apps) shows up on the bottom. Once I hit another app in the carousel then they go fully split screen and the white dot appears between them in the middle of the screen.
I do not seem to have this issue.  The photos come up within a second or two... 
A week or so ago I was having data issues.  I wasn't able to get 3G/4G in any of the usual places.  VZ had no idea what was going on.  It got better by itself. 
I have the same issue on my S6 Edge Plus, once I exit the One Hand mode the screen goes back to norm size but the keyboard (in all apps) stays small...driving me nuts
Settings - display and wallpaper - one handed operations. Unchecked the one handed input.
I switched as well. I do miss stock Android, but I've always liked the SPen (I had a Note II back in the day). With some de-bloating, theming, and some Xposed Modules, I feel comfortable enough with TouchWiz to not hate it so much. The phone physically though is fantastic. The screen and camera are stellar and I enjoy quickly unlocking my phone with the fingerprint sensor. I'm sure it's different strokes for different folks, and I know that the new N6 and N5 are gonna be out probably before year's end, but I feel good about upgrading to the Note 5. 
Get the Super Ballistics tempered glass one. I have it, absolutely love it. No effects. Crystal clear. 
You can use 248. I'm using it now with Android Pay and everything is working fine. 
Thanks for the info. Seems to be working on my end as well. The only concern I have is once i installed the newest version of google play services it gave me a quick error message about my account. It apears to cleared itself. Hopefully evwry continues  to work flawlessly. Thanks again 
I agree. If your still within your exchange period get it replaced. Me and my wife got a paid of 64 bg note 5s and we havent had any random reboots or issues. Good luck !
just don't disable Smart Manager 
I was told night before last, by Samsung Pay Beta support, that there is an update coming anytime now for the Samsung Pay app. It could be that you were accepted for the second phase of the trial testing and when the new update arrives you'll be able to install it.
I know you said without root, but if anyone rooted is looking for this, then just download Emoji Switcher on the play store - you can switch between a selection of emojis including Google and iOS
Sorry, I had a typo in my original and missed it ??this is the combination I was using for soft reset, not home/volumedown.Thanks for the input any other ideas?
Awesome,  I'll try that out.  Also,  I noticed last night that,  for me,  instagram was using 21% of my battery throughout the day just by being open in the background. This didn't show up in Gsam Battery monitor and only showed up in the settings/battery window. 
Nah I'm on verizon and have gotten 9-10hr SOT.That was like the week or two after I got the phone, I think since then a lot of my apps assist in draining the battery quicker, now it's more like 7-8hr SOT
I think they might have screwed it up with a software update. I used to turn it all down to zero and it looked normal, but I'm with you on this, it's definitely still smoothing my face out when it's set to zero.
I was wishing for this same thing a few days ago after first getting my Note5 and messing with Package Disabler Pro. Man, the developer of that app must be making a killing!My philosophy was to disable only packages I knew what they did. If I was unsure, I would google them, and if I couldn't find an answer, I would just leave them. So far, I have not had any real problems. There were a few cases where I found something I wanted would crash, so I'd have to go in an figure out which package it was an re-enable it. Nothing too crazy though. My battery life feels almost too good to be true, but I didn't use the phone that much before Disabler Pro to know the difference. Good luck!
Think it'll work with the defender case?
Step 1 restart phoneIf this doesn't workStep 2 uninstall recently installed apps that may cause lag Step 3 factory reset phoneStep 4 if none of these work get a replacement device 
I learned a lot from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYRIX9YP3Lk). He showed some really useful features I had no idea about.
For some reason when i first got the phone i was having about 4 hours max... I just use package disabler pro on basic things that i dont use and deleted the facebook app...:) 
Delete your certificates. Under Lock screen and security settings &gt Other security settings &gt clear credentials. That will bring back none for Lock screen options
Have multiple Gear watches and Notes. Using the Gear S with my Note 5 as we speak 
My Note 5 from AT&ampT came with a little insert about this it comes from just signing into the normal Amazon app (actually, mine had me go to the get5att page, *then* sign into the app). I did that when I got my phone on the 28th and got the same email yesterday. I actually forgot about it after that until now!
If this really bugs you, or if you want to try something new, Fenix for Twitter is the answer. Fenix is a Twitter client that handles tweets more efficiently and even has an AMOLED mode to make use of the screen on this beast. I'm gonna shut up now because I feel like an ad. 
I miss the stereo speakers and the design  (Dat curve doe). Everything else makes this phone better to me. The screen is awesome, it's crazy fast, and SPen is extremely useful
Received the credit as well. Didn't do much more than just sign into the Amazon app which was already loaded on the phone. Saved me 5 bucks on a glass screen protector from them. 
Thank you for the help. I enabled the nfc related things but didn't restart my phone.  R restarting the phone fixed it.  I can use my headphones with nfc now :DThanks! 
What kind of content do you use the VR for? I just picked up a note 5 (32gb :() and I'm wondering if it's worth it. 
Technically, it should. The system creates all the cache and new apps don't get installed as much anymore so in theory, the phone shouldn't waste as much battery. But in practice, it still keeps doing what it did. Right now I have a big problem with my note 5 920C. The android system wastes too much power so some people said to wait for it to stabilize. 
Settings &gt Accessibility &gt Dexterity and interaction &gt Activating using movementTriggering the proximity detector will open the screen, and you can just lightly touch the fingerprint sensor to unlock. No buttons pressed.
Google Play Music is the best music app in my opinion. You can even set it to automatically upload/download songs from you computer. Check it out!
I found the same issue with Samsung non fast wireless charger. MOST of the time it will start off charging ok (and sometimes stay that way) but other times I will notice it start flashing (not charging) in 1mins or so and other times I wake up and the phone is at like 93% I don't have that with my [Seneo 3-Coils Wireless Charger Pad](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B018QTGFG4). I highly recommend it.
I used one for a couple of weeks but really hated the fact that that case would not allow the use of screen off notes without the cover already being open. Returned the case and bought the Samsung branded clear rear cover.
But there are other factors than my phone is broken.  Maybe the app is set to stream high quality or maybe the app got an update that caused issues.  Maybe the phone software needs to be reflsshed. 
duh! yeah I like TouchWiz now... don't see that as a problem anymore. 
might be bad cell in the battery.. yeah return it as lianw suggested. 
That actually does have a great look!  [This](http://imgur.com/1qZH7Ne) is my look after all your guys help. I like the lack of gaps in your lettering but I like the color of mine. Decisions.....
Yes I have the EXACT setup as you. Tetra and stock keyboard. I found out it was Tetra that changed my settings.
My samsung keyboard has a tab key and i would prefer a send key, how do i change that like OP?
Well I'm not 100% sure. It's my best guess. If you installed it via the latest update, it would at least open if KNOX wasn't tripped.
So yours came out from a drop? My phone's in a case and I have to deliberately reach in and click the pen to get it out so an accidental pocket press is unlikely in my case. I suppose I just thought the damn things would stay in a little better. Is there any software on the phone that releases it that you know of?
Many emulators are on the Google Play store. just type in the system you want in the search. Once you get the emulator you can download roms from wherever. If you have them on your PC you can transfer them with USB cable to a directory of your choice on the phone and then tell the emulator where the roms are. If you download them to the phone directly then you should use a file manager to move the files around. 
Same issue here. I tried accessing the announcement tabs multiple times and it worked once... clicked on claim promotion and got samsung pay has stopped working error. Nice!
The CEO of LoopPay himself mentioned late Oct/Nov to me

Hes saying the included Samsung fast charger barely heats up the phone, which I've had similar results.
What? The pen mechanism is completely hardware related 
Running yes.  Still won't add my AMEX.  I'll keep trying and report back.
What about your other cards? It's giving me registration error after I finish the second screen where you put in billing address
Check for updates on your phone and for the samsung pay app. 
Similar route, actually barely using my tablet since i got it.In terms of 4 vs 5 price wasn't an issue for me, and the better working fingerprint scanner definitely is worth it. Also read about the 4's performance problems on other reddit discussions.My biggest reservation was the software, especially coming from stock on the nexus, and reading all the performance problems of the s6. So far the note 5 touch wiz is fine, ugly colors and some useless gadget features, but the performance is spotless and the interface does its job.L
Well, I'm a bit of a phone whore so I kind of always upgrade whether I need to or not . I used the Note 4 for 1months.  I like the build quality, MST (Samsung Pay) option, themes and overall snappy performance of TouchWiz with the Note5. That said, in no way is the Note 4 a slouch. It still has a more than capable processor, fantastic camera and beautiful screen. 
Please report back if there is any battery life improvement
I've been using an Anker Qi wireless charger that I picked up on Amazon a few weeks ago. No issues. Works well. Good price. 
I remember back when google wallet was blocked, a way around it was if you had root, you could edit your build.prop file to make everything recognize your phone as a compatible device and then try it. With this detecting root and Knox being tripped for unlocking bootloader to obtain root, sadly this won't be an option anymore 
No update yet, hopefully we'll get one today.
I did this jump and I'm overall satisfied.Phone doesn't feel much larger due to the edges on the back and the screen color is visibly better.I have only two complaints compared to s5:- Battery life is weaker (I mean, not really since this phone is using QHD display with even bigger screen but don't except the same battery life you had on the s5)- Lock screen delay/stutter (I occasionally notice stutter after swiping to unlock the phone or I notice a delay of couple of seconds when I swipe to see the notification for that app to open.)
This helped me understand the spen :http://allaboutgalaxynote.com/galaxy-note-5-how-to-guide/everything-about-galaxy-note-5-s-pen/
Fast charging? 
Can't use telegram for google voice. Also no issues like this on my 6P or other devices. Thanks though.
I really find it hard to believe there are so many wide spread problems on such a high end device. I've experienced a couple myself but luckily i was able to fix them. 
There was a new update that redid the app. Have you updated? My widget crashed after the update and I had to put up a new widget based on the updated version. 
A little warning. The neo hybrid makes it so the wireless charging does not work.
I have delt with this before. If you can connect properly to other wifi then we know something is up with your router. I would reccomend contacting the manufacture of the router. When I did they had me go to the routers ip adress online tweak with some setting and it helped me. Good luck!
I had an iphone 5 before going to the S5 (my iphone 5 just... started to fail). I'm still... on the edge about going back really. I really want something with a *good* stylus because I sketch/scribble a lot. How is the iphone 6 for battery life?
Probably not. Obviously you could set some gesture controls to open the app, but it won't be the same. 
I got it as well. Has anyone figured out what was in the update?
Unfortunately, Samsung Pay still won't let me update the full app for some reason even after receving my beta invitation...Edit: Just got the update!!! finally! no idea how it was suddenly available but yeah I just installed it! can't wait to test it out
Or you could get a battery case for it, so u can protect AND charge your phone
You stuck the metal plate to the inside of the case, then put tape over it? That's clever. What kind of tape did you use?
Yes, of course wireless charging heats up the battery. I said that it didn't heat the battery up noticeably more than wired charging, not that wireless charging generates no heat.I've tested wireless vs wired charging over the last couple hours charging from 60% to full and have the following numbers reported by CPU-z:Ambient temperature: 21CIdle battery temp: 25.4CMax wireless fast charging temp: 29.5CMax wired fast charging temp: 29.0CTemperature while playing Pocket Mortys (discharging): 33.7C
I'm not on my home screen enough for it to really matter.
I also like this case because it is curved on the back edges to match the phone. I have found many cases do not and make holding the phone less confortable.
Ok, thanks for telling me. This is not OEM it looks different from the stock part, but the listing states OEM (I doubted it from the start). I'm fine with the decrease of image quality as I already use a mirrorless camera for more serious photos. I just got this for function more than quality. I'll consid.er going your way if I decide to get a better fix, so thanks.Edit: I'll test the cover out tomorrow, although I cannot confirm the material of the cover.
Use the drawing app and see if it's a dead spot in the screen. If it does not work you have a hardware problem with the screen. 
Is that a marshmallow based ROM? Because based on the blue bar it looks like it.
Got an email on 1/6 saying my submission has been accepted and that I need to wait for them to process and confirm my submitted data. 
Snapprefs, youtube adaway
Because the recent apps screen is exactly that it's a list of every app you've used recently. It was one of the changes lollipop introduced. It's not a list of what's currently running on your phone. For that you go to Settings &gt Applications &gt Application manager &gt Running. 
Sync for Reddit also supports multi window 
Is it in the radius of the spen button that appears on screen when the spen is out?
Gonna have to say whicons and nova launcherLink me: whiconsLink me: nova launcher prime
This will be possible in marshmallow update.
Great.. Thats what i got on my edge plus yesterday too... At about 15% left :) 
The Note 5 uses Quick Charge 2.- Here's Qualcomm's docu that lists ithttps://www.qualcomm.com/documents/quick-charge-device-list
Mine broke in the same spot about a month ago. The pen still works fine though so I've just been keeping the pen permanently out of the hole, laying on my desk.
For me it seems to kick back in at around 98% when on wireless charging which leads to lots of heat.. I've since stopped using the wireless charger at night and only when at my desk so I can keep eye on it.I notice wireless charging heats up my phone quite a bit and fast too . I'd imagine it's due to battery circuits lower the amp and voltage down on wall charger while it can't do it on wireless and it's either full bore on or offI honestly don't recommend wireless for overnight charging and only for top ups during the day. If you keep it topped up you won't need to charge over night due to speed of wireless charging and good idle time if you don't have keep awake bugs (use greenify, doze, powernap or new kernel)
No case on my Note 4 or Note 5, I love the slimness and design too much. Plus I never drop my phones anyway
Thank you guys for your replies! I guess this issue will get more attention as the firstop set of note 5 users start sending in their phones for servicing in a few years.  Really enjoy this phone, so I have no regrets even if the battery life does seem short at times.  Well happy new years everyone and thanks again.
It's been removed. Sorry to say, I'm hoping it makes a return with the 6.Upgrade.
Did you try connecting it to a charger for at least 5+ mins? 
I still get very good battery life even in poor cell signal areas so it may not be that much of a factor. It is annoying though, when I am at home, to see cell standby hit the 30-40% level of battery consumption. I wish my area had better signal. WiFi seems to exacerbate the issue as well, in poor signal areas. 
Sucks that the ATT version doesn't have this. I would assume it's Samsung's version of Doze mode. So it is a good thing?
Somtimes what looks like a reboot is actually not. I don't know what to call it, but it seems to almost like a mini-reboot. It takes a shorter time, and the app history remains. Generally all opened apps are closed and the RAM is cleared. I think this happens when the phone is overheated or the CPU is overtaxed. I used to have this problem on my Note 3 but have never seen it on my Note5.
Get a Gear VR. You'll thank me later. $100. You can save for it if you have to! 
I had a similar issue with mine, not sure if it was dirt or moisture. Take a isopropyl alcohol swab and run it over the button for about a minute while pushing and releasing the button. Do this a total of 3 times while waiting about a half hour in-between. Worked for mine, hope this helps!
I think I maybe added less than 5 more options from what the guy said in the link I have in my original post. I've had friends who just click the basic disable bloatware button and that works too.Click on Here up top and follow that guide. He gives you a couple options for how much you want to disable. I did the 2nd most extreme disabling option, and like I said, the battery life on this phone is truly amazing compared to anything I've ever had. Yes it took configuring, but man is it worth it.
I do have the Gear Manager app so that might be it. 
You can use Android Pay is Knox is tripped FYI, just not if you're rooted. (Source, my old Note 5)And I use Android Pay a lot actually. It's only on my Discover card, but the places I'd actually use my discover card support it, except for maybe like 2 retailers, which I'll get to use Samsung Pay with soon.I'm talking about the status bar clock. The font is so big and the AM/PM is huge. Does it let you change the status bar to look like AOSP? (Lollipop WiFi Bars, Status Bars, sound icons, etc.)
Yeah, I already activated Samsung Pay. I use it alot. But no goodies for me, right now at least. 
Made the same jump. Absolutely worth it. I use the SPen 1000times more than I could've imagined. Idk how I got along without it.
From my experience over the past week, it's worked everywhere I've tried the MST payments EXCEPT for anywhere with Square card readers. For whatever reason, all of them have recognized a card swipe but then declined the transaction. And the looks on cashier's faces have been priceless. 
Have you tried installing the app Greenify?  I have a Note 5 on Sprint.  I use a black background, keep the screen dimmer set to auto, turned off the little lights on the back and recent apps buttons, turned off all of the vibrating feedback thingies and I use Greenify.  I am very happy with my battery life so far.
You're probably correct, but I don't mind.  I'm a bit obsessed with the battery life on my phone.
I bought mine last week. Told them I wanted a Note 5. Had my eye on it for a while. Immediately went out back and came out with the Black Sapphire (looks great btw). No other options are available at least at this time. If you do get one, make sure if you buy a flip case the magnet doesn't interfere with the S Pen. I had this issue and exchanged it for a black OtterBox. No regrats.  
I found my cell standby dropped a lot when i turned off VoLTE
Samsung Keyboard for the handwriting feature when the S Pen is out.
The HTC m8 keyboard was great. Samsung one not so much. I still use it because I like the auto swapping for when I pull out the pen. But everytime it incorrectly corrects something I get angry
Reseat the sim card, is my first suggestion.  After that try a factory reset.  If that doesn't work, good luck with tech support.
This what used to actually happen, however,I just restarted my phone and found out that it didn't clear the default applications.Anyways, thanks for the clarification. It is more helpful than just downvoting without providing any input.
Naked until I scratched it in a drop. Had a skinomi skin on there, then went to a slim case. Then step dad got me a custom case thats even slimmer. 
I bought it from Samsung on amazon, maybe it's that I'm coming from a oneplus one, I have 37% left and 2 hours and a half of screen on time so it's not that bad but it certainly feels much worse than what I was used to.
I disabled anything FB  and Tmobile bloat. Also went to a darker theme and keep screen under 50%. Now i get a full day of use.
I've been caseless for a couple months by now. First it was because I got a mount for my car that couldn't properly grip the wallet case I was using before, and now it's that plus having a Gear VR which would never work with any case.
Fellow Canadian here! I'm averaging 3hrs SOT right now so I'm wondering what you're doing to have that awesome battery life
There seem to be quite a few in the [nexus 6p subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nexus6P/search?q=amoled+wallpapers&amprestrict_sr=on&ampsort=relevance&ampt=all) but you could also try /r/spaceporn
Please visit the link. We are still not sure what's causing issues. Technically it should be fixed with most of the custom kernels but with arter kernel I'm still having issues losing battery percentages while idle. http://forum.xda-developers.com/note5/help/crazy-battery-drain-note5-t3295987
The thinnest cases i've seen are the official samsung flip cases. very thin leather front and back. stops your screen from getting scratched up if there is dirt in your pocket. 
Been seeing he same issue im certain it isnt hardware specfic..sometimes a plain old reboot clears it up ..I noticed it didn't happen as frequently after I uninstalled the google messenger app I use for text messages. It seems to me its an issue tied with T-Wiz... kinda think this would have came up at some point in QA 
I had this happen to me once.  Try wiping the cache.  To wipe cache with stock recovery: turn your phone off, then press volume up, home, and power buttons at the same time. It'll boot into recovery. Then scroll down to wipe cache, and wipe it.  Use your volume buttons to scroll and power to hit enter.I also did a couple other things like re-enabling all bloatware with package disabler pro and uninstalling Greenify and Doze apps.  I think there might have been a bug with one of the packages I disabled.  Also those battery saving apps just ended up draining my battery even more.   
Just read that thread, sounds like more of a hardware problem with your phone rather than a sleep/wake issue. 
Well  understand that but i almost have the same set up as on the old phone. In fact i have emails syncing less often two hours instead of as they arrive. I suspect its something I'm missing because i haven't changed how i used the phone. Its all emails, banking and calls and a little social media here and there. I don't see how i can go from having almost 500MB left at the end of the month to using it all within the first two weeks if the month. That's why i suspect its the phone 
I was able to fix this by turning off wifi during sleep (WiFi&gtAdvanced) and then going to the Mobile Data settings, clicking Google Play Services in the list of apps that use data, and disabling background data for it. This completely eliminated the Play Services battery drain. However, I now have to be on WiFi to use Google apps like YouTube, Pictures, News, etc (not Google Search though), so caveat emptor. I hope my experience can help you, though.
 Its not slow, but I don't think it's as fast as the plugged in 2a wall charger the phone comes with, since I think the max on these pads xfer is 1a.  But it is more than adequate for overnight charging and even for topping off.
It's a capacitive touch button to the right of the physical home button. Unless you've got really long thumbs its nearly impossible to reach with your left hand.   
Just by going into app drawer and choosing edit and disabling it from there.
Nope. I just updated the software. So far no random restarts. 
They added $696 on to my bill and told me not to pay it if it hadn't been reimbursed by the end of my billing cycle because they did show that they have the phone it just hadn't graded in the warehouse yet. After 2 months they finally credited my account through full amount and the late fee. I had to talk to customer service quite a bit though and it was a pain.
None of the above for me. I've noticed it doesn't align with the body. And the tip of the spen moves a little bit. Doesn't really bug me. THOUGH what does bug me is when I drop or pull my phone out of my pocket and the button accidentally unclicks.
Hahahaha! I just lol'd irl. Don't fret! I've got a tempered glass screen protector on there.
Look at my post up top in this thread, Samsung replaced kies with Samsung Smart Switch.  You can useuse it just like kies to backup everything to a computer, you just have to install the app on your phone and the program on your computer
Open your camera, select pro mode, set shutter speed to 1secs and timer to 5 secs. Place your phone where it can stand still. Then click shoot button, as it counts down from 5 to , you get to your position , when you hear bibibibibibibiibip sound, you have 1seconds to draw.  Open your led light and draw until you hear the picture sound.And one more important detail. You need to be in a dark room, obviously.
Nope, no editing.It took a couple of tries tough to draw and move out of picture without being captured by the camera. 
Oh I totally get it. I love the stylus, at this point I HAVE to have the stylus in a phone... Which limits me to. Well. The Note series. If that's the case get the N5 or wait 9 months for the N6, those are your choices as far as I see it. I personally couldn't wait that long haha
I'm kind of experiencing this bug which h hopefully 6.fixes. Until then I'm gonna look into Tasker profile to turn off wifi, data etc when I lock phone and turn on when I unlock.  
Try a aukey fast charge cable been using them for a while now only thing is I've had 2 break on me where the USB plug will bend but maybe it's just my bad luck ,they always work for fast charge for me and they're about 6$ for a 3 pack roughly 
The battery is gonna sit between the NFC transponder and reciever and block the signal.
The first time I used the phone after its first charge... the battery went down like crazy. It got better afterward.     But, and I don't know how much this matters, as soon as I connected the phone to a charger, I updated its software.  The phone was really slow that first night.
Where did you buy it? Are you sure it's not a knockoff? That doesn't sound at all like my experience with the Note 5.
It's about choice, lifestyle, and a numbers game. You will hear people state they always go caseless without issue but none of us can see the future and accidents happen. I don't usually wear a seat belt either but I won't pretend like because I am a decent driver, I won't end up paying the price for someone else not being a good driver.. Really only you can make that decision.
Everything I have read says the tolerances are just too tight for a screen protector or case and the Gear VR.I love my Note 5 so far, and the Gear VR, but this does concern me because ANY blemish on the Note 5 screen, even a spec of dust, gets magnified HUGELY by the Gear VR lenses.
Have you tried uninstalling Facebook amd Facebook Messenger?
I submitted my ticket November 28th, received my charger early January!! This was bought with the $10Samsung credit promo however..  
Haha no, a car battery have way way more screen on time than that. I'm guessing it's because my background and basically everything is black thanks to my theme, which saves energy because it's an AMOLED screen.
I'm on a T-Mobile Note 5 on stock with no root using Package Disabled Pro and the material theme since I came from a Nexus 5. I'm using NOVA launcher as well using the stock lollipop icons for system apps that are compatible with it in the NOVA launcher.
For some reason every time I try to change the color for every app, I still get blue. Any ideas?

i'm thinking of rooting but would keep the stock rom.  i mostly want to get rid of the bloat ware and not 'disable' it.I use belle UI icon set with Nova launcher pro.
So does the Note 3, Note 8 and Note 1just in case that helps at all. However the older ones aren't as pressure sensitive on the screen - but they all work well otherwise. 
In all honesty the sound quality on my iPhone was much better. With themer I never had a problem with it on a previous samsung galaxy round and my old s5. I'm getting used to it crashing  As for heads up I'm kinda getting used to it but at the same time still.hating it 
It really is amazing how much detail it captures. Zooming in you see the water droplets. It's a fantastic camera. 
I've never seen any phone do this, let alone the Note 5. That being said, it was clearly a defective panel, and to my knowledge there's nothing about the Note 5 that would make this any more likely to happen than any other phone. You shouldn't be nervous to get another one. 
I've tried a bunch of different Launcher's and I keep going back to Google Now Launcher. Action Launcher wasn't bad but what annoyed me was the advertising upgrade bars that would come up every once in awhile. 
Wait, how do the screen-off memos still work if the detection mechanism is broken?
Buy $3worth of automation and permissions apps to fix your $80cell phone.God damnit I'm so mad at myself for not checking root status before buying this phone on Verizon. 
Same. The problem is something with the radio. I'm on WiFi and it's shitting itself inside out trying to get a better LTE signal because I get kinda shitty reception indoors in this town. Maybe we should fix it with roo-HAHA never mind!
I use wireless charging sometimes. It's not an official Samsung charger but they all pretty much work the same way and my phone gets pretty hot as well. Because of this I don't use it to much just because I'm weird like that. But since Samsung is pushing it so hard I can't imagine it being bad for the phone, I'm sure they have done extensive testing. I wouldn't worry about it if I were you. 
Package Disabler and Tasker don't cost $30. It's a fairly cheap way to rectify some of the phone's short comings for those who forgot to check root status of the note line before buying.
Take off back with heat gunRemove color film with razorLogos stay because they are printed on the glassPaint what ever colorUse double sided stick tape to put back on device.Its still drying, will post pics after its done.
It's just a reporting artifact, it's not actually charging that fast. It's not physically possible.3Ah battery at 3.7v, 18W fast charger (I think that's what the included one is?), that's 37 minutes for a full charge at perfect efficiency and constant maximum draw. That's a theoretical maximum of 2.7%/min. Your phone clearly isn't doing 7% a minute.
Re-enable everything and don't use disable all in Package Disabler. Pick specific things and disable them only if you know what you're doing.Stop clearing ram and hibernating stuff with Cleanmaster.You can't see your screen on time if you've disabled Smart manager.
I have that cord and I use it with my Galaxy Note 5 using the stock charger and the cable does indeed support fast charge. In fact, it's not the cable that determines if fast charging will work, its the charger.
Yup. If you want the true android experience, go with the nexus 6p. If you want to get to use marshmallow anytime soon, go with the nexus 6p. If you want the pen, go with the note 5, it's the only thing samsung has going for their phones now. I forgot to mention one other positive thing on the note 5, samsung pay. It's the best pay system since it works with every terminal out there. It works differently than android and apply pay. 
Screenshot? Not sure what you're referring to. 
Wallpaper? 
Oh cool. I haven't used Wanam since the Note 4 and he didn't have it entirely functional.  Xposed was really beta back then for TouchWiz. 
[Here's mine.](http://i.imgur.com/OUnaV13.png) I'm using Nova Launcher with the Moonstone icon pack.
Same here. The next word prediction is great and it learns really quickly too! I always use this.
Only share, save  to scrapbook, and save to gallery are at the bottom after it does the screenshot animation and sound. Other times I have seen scroll capture at the bottom even when current app doesn't have any scrolling to be done on screen...strange.
Chrome -settings-site settings- notifications
I like that. I think I'd leave the camera uncovered. 
Unfortunately, both SideSync 3.and 4.crash on install (though 3.makes more progress during installation than 4.0, which crashes almost instantly).
Go to your apps, then smart manager, then RAM, then upper right click manage apps.  Everything is defaulted to auto stop after 1minutes I believe. You can choose to cancel auto stop or to set the time frame longer. 
i dont have a smart manager app
I know everyone is against task killers but have you tried something like advanced task manager? I think it allows you to choose which apps get auto killed. 
So you have Verizon Messenger AND the stock messaging app? Perhaps the tone was configured for the stock messaging app.
Yeah I got that email on 12/26 saying the same thing and still nothing.
Pull out s pen, smart select... Couldn't be easier
Benefits of root will depend on what apps you use, but I have found no dependable quality roms. Rooting will lose you the ability to use Samsung pay, and if you use tap to pay the security losses of rooting should be considered seriously.If you're just looking for a better looking and feeling UI try out Nova launcher. There is a video on YouTube on how to Nexusfi a Note 5: https://youtu.be/bC6mw8oH_HQ. I did this  and love the experience. My last phone was a Nexus 5 and I still wish I had vanilla android but this will do until I can afford it again.As far as the Marshmallow update, last I read was Q1 2016 expected in the US February. It is currently being tested in parts of Europe and South Korea. I've read it is buggy and a step back. Guess we have another month to see. Remember February could mean February 29th, and that might only be when they send it to the big four. 
I recommend monoprice the [Premium USB to Micro USB](http://www.monoprice.com/product?c_id=103&ampcp_id=10303&ampcs_id=1030307&ampp_id=9762&ampseq=1&ampformat=2) is what i use and have no problems.
Hi Knapz, came in here for the same problem.  Thanks.  Would you know if there's a way to go to settings-battery WITHOUT that damn Smart Manager app?  
Yes, I got it some time last week. My gear VR is on the way! 
All this time I thought you had to put the s pen in with the Samsung face down or it would get stuck. I've been really careful and don't even use it without light. I'm dumb. 
Ok, yeah if not using a pc and smart switch software then no comprehensive backup solution without root.  Nice thing about smart switch is it even backs up sms,  mms,  all apps and app data,  photos, etc.  Google photos and one drive are nice for photos and docs
How many other mainstream devices have Marshmallow? Very very few in the US. There is no rhyme or reason to updates. My T-Mobile Note5 has had 4 updates already. Samsung never promised anyone a January Marshmallow update. It was said to come Q1 2016.
I used the clear non folio version. Dropped the phone and the case edges got damaged and saved the edges on the phone itself BUT the back glass got a hairline crack while the case back itself is fine. I assume the other Samsung cases are similar in that they provide very low levels of protection.
tldr - Tweet Phantom_Glass, show interest for a high quality Gorilla Glass screen protector!I'm probably going to try and get my hands on a Zagg but if people here have twitter and they read this you should tweet Phantom_Glass to show them there is interest in a high quality screen protector.I have heard very good things about them although I have never used them. They have very high quality standards from what I hear so I don't think halo effect will be acceptable to them.. Most importantly to me though is that they use Gorilla Glass.
Thanks for the fantastic info and in-depth comparison. I've used both in store for a few minutes, and definitely noticed how much better the G4 layout was, but it's great to hear from someone that's used both extensively. I've never had a top (or even close to top) notch camera in my phones. I use a Nikon coolpix A (which is phenomenal) for my carry everywhere kit, but I still can't bring myself to lug it a number of places. Had the G4 not had such systemic touchscreen issues, I may have overlooked their ui (which I hate) and picked one up. But I just couldn't ignore those issues together. My wife has the S6 active and I've been blown away by the photos it takes in auto mode. If it had the same 1second long exposure capabilities of the Note, and if I felt confident Att would support the phone long term via updates, I'd have bought one already. I'm down to just waiting to see whay the new Nexus brings, and how the Sony xperia does on release. If I'm not blown away by either, I'll probably just pick up a Note 5 and pray AT&ampT gets M on it before 2017.
Just purchased my Note 5, waiting in the mail for it. I am coming from a Nexus 6.I've been frequently getting annoyed with just how inconsistent the camera is. I've missed a lot of photo opportunities with my son because of it. The topper on the cake was I broke the screen and replaced it... and just today I took my phone off the charger and noticed a new large crack in the screen.I can't fault the phone, who knows what happened as to why it cracked but considering i had just spent $28to fix the screen already, i couldn't justify fixing it again....anybody want to buy a Nexus 6?
Well, to be honest. I don't. I prefer the 6P.The things I like more about the Note5 are:* Bottom headphone jack* Less slippery* S-Pen Stuff
Judging by that screenshot, you've got another app with admin privileges.Look in Other Security Settings -&gt Device Administrators
I have a Verizon-branded Note 5 and came from a rooted Nexus 5.I pretty much never used root and you wouldn't really need to unless you want to do some serious tweaking.  I don't miss root at all with my Note 5.The S Pen is, in face amazing and I use it all the time.  The multiwindow can be useful given the right circumstances (such as redditing while taking notes).The screen is beautiful, size is perfect for me (I have big hands). It's a great phone and you probably won't regret it, branded or not.
Relay for sure. I have the dark amoled theme and according to gsam by battery drain is only like 150-200Ma when it's normally 400+. I could be on reddit for hours on this thing! Plus push notifications on my pebble for replies is nice!
&gt I guess you're saying that I should go for the 6P over the Note 5 if I won't use the S-pen all that much?That's almost *exactly* how I would phrase it. The S Pen is cool, if you'd use it. If not, no reason to deal with the TouchWiz burden IMO. Both phones have great cameras, displays, hardware and build quality. 
I've been using the Anker brand, braided cables since I got the phone and they've been awesome.

You're welcome. Single sim phones sure have some advantages over dual sim phones. Here are some cons of dual sim phones:  they tend to drain battery relatively faster, since the phone is connected at two different networks simultaneously (though second sim slot can be disabled in the settings thus making it effectively a single sim phone), and also many apps lack support of dual sim.

1) My Note 5 has never frozen on me.2).  I've never owned the Note 4.3) I've never owned the Note 4, but the one on the Note 5 doesn't always take my thumb print.  I have to try several times.  I might have to reset my thumbprint.4) No idea.  Sorry.5) I really like the S-pen.6) Some themes slow down the phone.  If you've found that your phone seems to be slow and laggy, change to another theme.
I agree. The clear defaults dialog should appear one time. It's stupid that it doesn't, but the more you start to set defaults the less you'll see of it. The high volume warning never goes away and bugs the shit out of me. It should appear only once, too. I'm an adult Samsung. I know what I'm doing. 
Oh my god, I was having this issue with notifications starting this morning and it was driving me insane!  I am downloading now, praying mine are also fixed with this. Thanks.
I was having the same issues. I got in contact with Samsung Pay, and the informed me that an update was going to be released early September for T-mobile, and AT&ampT  customers resolving this issue. He didn't have a specific date, but said it should be resolved in the next 1to 15 days (I called last night). He also said if it wasnt resolved in that time frame to call back. This morning I had an update for my phone, so as you would guess, I was pretty stoked...buuuuuuut nothing. Same issue. Hopefully soon. 
Me too. I have AT&ampT but after getting the congrats, you're in! email, there is no Samsung Pay. Just the same placeholder app. Nice.
I habe both the Note 4 and Note 5. My Note 4 has android 5.1.1 and it sucks. My note 5 out performs the note 4 hands down. My galaxy S5 out performs my Note 4. Go with the Note 5. I play games and watch videos all day without needing a charge until after several hours of use. The Note 5 kicks the Note 4s ass hands down and that is exactly why I gave my 13 year old son who breaks phones like kids eat candy and kept the note 5 for myself.
Thats wierd, i got the video calling icon too on the dialer. What is this?
The Memo app should have been backing up your memos from your old phone using your Samsung account. The Memo app is designed for phones that don't use S Note (non-Note devices), but you can still download it and your Samsung account should sync your memos over. You can force a sync by going into your Samsung account settings in the phone's Accounts setting page and sync'ing (make sure Memo sync is on). If nothing syncs, then your previous device didn't sync any memos.
&gt I just realized after typing this, but the autocorrect sucks.Use a different keyboard. One of the major benefits of Android in general is the easy switching of keyboard. While iOS has added user installable keyboards recently the tech is far more mature on Android.The most popular keyboard is probably SwiftKey https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.touchtype.swiftkey&amphl=enNot only does it have better auto-correct and prediction from the start but it learns how you talk very quickly and predictions become far more tailored.
I would try to get it replaced. That sounds like a hardware problem if resets didn't help.
One the layout of the G4 was perfect. It actually looked like a camera. The button placement and adjustments were very easy to make. The Note 5 is pretty difficult to change the settings. They are laid out okay but the actual adjusting is just awkward. The manual mode on G4 automatically shows the focus points and the level. When shooting low ISO like 5for 4 or more seconds for some reason the Note will show some noise. I shouldn't get any noise at 5ISO at night. The G4  is clean when shooting at night. The shutter is restricted to 1seconds with larger steps on the note where the G4 goes up to 3seconds and half step adjustments. Over all both cameras are freaking amazing and the Note has the G4  beat in every aspect except those listed. Especially with the speed of the camera launching and taking the first picture in low light. My G4 could have a delay of up to 8 seconds while it tried to figure out what it was doing while the note 5 is instant. The sharpening and post processing is way better on the note. The G4 always had some artifacting and chroma noise that would make things look rather smeared when you pixel peeped. Hope this helps. 
For me it would be: Samsung Galaxy Note5 64GB AT&ampT Black Sapphire SM-N920AZKEATT with 16 megapixel camera, 5.7 quad HD super AMOLED display, and octo-core Exynos 64-bit processor all in one continuous line in size 72 font
You want to wait a couple of days for the phone to set in. Also I score around 6300on antutu with the ocasional spike to 80000-90000.Why am I getting down voted for stating a fact? 
You have to go into the bluetooth settings menu and click the gear icon beside the device name and under use for make sure call/media audio is turned on!
Yeah the Google keyboard is so much better. I would also try the other Google apps , messenger (new) , Google now launcher and calendar 
Maybe try going into your settings&gtapplication settings&gtapplication manager and clear the cache on any relevant apps.
I got the update on Sunday night. I had just live chatted with support earlier that day too. I haven't had a chance to use it yet since there's no stores around my campus.
Yes when trying to close apps, and I have problems with the top left screen not registering touches, again.
Smart manager is listed as com.samsung.android.sm.Cleanmaster is unnecessary because clearing ram constantly isn't helpful, and Smart manager will automatically run App optimization on applications that you don't use.http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1966571
I need/want the stylus most, heh. I scribble notes all the time, so something that is made for that is what I want. 
I wouldn't. T-Mobile is GSM, Sprint is CDMA, please don't flash it.
No, all I have is the option to turn on/off mobile data, turn on/off international data, and APN's. 
Nope. Nothing is worth tripping knox and losing warranty. I'm saying this because current gen samsung phones have problems with deepsleep. If something goes wrong then that's it. You're on your own
International version. Rooted (piece of piss) installed VENOM ROM with Spacex kernel and the thing just absolutely flies. No lag, no stutter, no issues. Threw Amplify on it and together with the kernel the battery life is fantastic.
Nope, no cracks. Only had it about a week, and I handle my phones well. 
I used a caseology case and everything works fine. If you mount the metal plate at the bottom of the phone wireless charging and nfc will work perfectly plus it works for the magnetic dock
[Signal Check](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blueline.signalchecklite&amphl=en)   can display the network you are connected to in the status bar.  [Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/jP4vBKC.png)http://imgur.com/jP4vBKC
AFAIK fi only works with nexus phones, you might be able to just pull the sim and stick it in a note5 though. If you're just running on T-Mobile why not just get on an actual T-Mobile plan?
The phone is perfect for me now. But honestly, I really liked how the MM beta looked and performed on the S6. Thats why I cannot wait for the update to hit the note 5.
Funky that you had the exact same issue ??maybe they pushed out an update on something that bricked them? Weird. You're the first person to describe having the same problem, everyone else's issues were it's unresponsive! reboot it! works great, thanks!, but I couldn't get it to do ANYthing.  I didn't buy the insurance (I had it on my last phone and never used it, was a waste for me), but since it died within 15 days (more like a week) I'm eligible for a brand-new replacement. Even within a year they'd do the Certified Like New option ??they tried to push that while I was there for whatever reason, but I figure if I'm eligible for brand new I'll take brand new.  Just have to ship mine in since it's 64GB and no local stores keep them in stock, so no phone for the weekend, but at least it's getting handled!
Can i jump on this and ask for some heavy duty cords recommendations? Family member tends to abuse the heck outta theirs and the micro usb side either no longer makes good contact or, i assume, the cord breaks taking the charge time to unbearable hours (5+ charge hours)
He means go into the stock messenging settings and see if there's an option to change the sound there.
XDA is a great resource. http://forum.xda-developers.com/note5All roots that I know of trip KNOX,  which voids warranty.   However, there are ways to hide it if going in for a service visit. 
 The only reason I do not, is because any scratches on the screen get magnified hugely by gear VR  and where are you can prevent cracks and breaks easily by being careful little bits of sand or anything else in your pocket that get to the screen will scratch it eventually 
I do have package disabled installed,  but I actually used the drawing app earlier to test if the area on the screen was dead and since then it's been working. If it happens s again though,  I'll re-enable the apps. Thanks! 
Yeah it was doing it yesterday i think location services was acting up because every two seconds maps would go stay on this road when usually it just stays quiet until i get to a turn
I had kinda the same problem and mine was a wakelock issue, check your battery stats and see if android system has your CPU total as 8-1hours, I did a factory reset and it seems to have fixed it
I called them, told them what happened (adhesive between the top and bottom portions failed), they sent me the info needed to ship it off and a week after they got it I had a replacement. That being said though, I had a laptop that took a bios update and essentially ate my HD, recovery partition and all. Samsung idiot told me it was done but offered nothing as far as assistance after than. Lets just assume this guy is going to buy another 80laptop instead of maybe I dunno a fcking restoration cd.So I call them up and ask if there is a place I can contact to get/buy a restore cd (ran linux for a few months but the security on the device will not allow dual boot and I got tired of doing phone related tasks on my work laptop, such as odin).Well they tell me they can ship me a cd and get this cleared up without charge. Fast forward three weeks and nothing. I call back and a bit peeved, they pulls up my info and says oh here is the problem, it was on back order. Let me push this through for you. Should be no more than 2 weeks.2 weeks pass and I am livid. I called back and got pushed up to some Executive Premium Customer support. I think that is there way of saying American Support.The lady then informs me that the order could not be processed because this is no longer considered a no charge item, even though their update  broke my laptop which they happily acknowledge.So I get sent to the parts people to buy it and they look up my computer and low and behold they dont have a restore CD listed for me. WHAT THEE FUCK.I blow up sammy a bit on twitter, they try to contact me and I tell them to kiss off. I bootlegged a copy of windows 7 (would've went to ten but I have a license for 8 that i purchased so I just needed a starting point to go legit). Of course there are no drivers so nothing works so I connect via USB tether and download some generic wifi drivers, get a prompt for Win10, say screw it and upgrade. Then I finally downloaded the sammy software for updating drivers and use that to get all my device specific drivers.If they didnt have their heads in their asses I would've just done it myself a month ago. Fck Samsung Support
I've never tried it in landscape mode actually so i couldn't tell you sorry 
The retail price will go down slightly over the lifespan of the phone. That will lower monthly payments if you do the retail installment method. The only time I've seen the Note series discounted on a two year contract is when the next one comes out or there's a holiday/special sale. 
I'm not somebody who roots his phone, so take the following with that knowledge.1. As far as I know, rooting doesn't exist on this phone or is hard to do.2. I like the stylus and its associated software.  I  like the ability to change themes.  There is sometimes a lagginess.   This happens on my phone when I change themes.  I think particular themes slow down the phone.  I usually delete those.  My favorite themes don't seem to slow the phone (they're my favorite partially because of the lack of slowness).
I was using an iPhone 6 for a while, and had it locked with touch id.  I think my problem comes with the home button turning on the screen and 911 being in the contact list.  I have set my work location in smart lock and changed the defaults on my phone to Contacts+.  
I had the same issue yesterday (1/3), and opened a ticket with the support team.  Haven't heard anything back from them, but I just did it from the phone, and it appears it went through.  In the Samsung Pay app, under More, there's an Events link that takes you to the form.edit: I got an email confirmation that my submission was received a few minutes after posting this, so I think that worked.
Im getting push notifications the problem is that only for messages they arrive some hours later....thnx anyway

I'm not afraid to drop it, for sure. 
how do you shoot raw on this camera?
The G4 might be better in terms of audio.
no. but the slim case makes the bottom smooth so that is no longer an issue. it's just flush.
Does resetting the setting do it? I don't use the stock keyboard so there is nothing learned in it for me. 
1.) Wait a bit and hit buttons. If it takes a really really long time I might hard reset the phone.2.) Diddnt have a note 4 so I cant comment. Its fine if not a little to thin.3.) Again cant speak the note 4, but its blazing fast and pretty accurate.4.) Not a clue.5.) Phone feels really nice, and both camera and screen are second to none.6.) Battery life is not as good as it could be but I would say its just fine. 
I wish it was twice a month. I could make a hundred more videos its so repeatable. 
Which model phone are you on? On my N920L I can turn both WiFi and LTE-A on and use them at the same time for the purpose of multi-path connection. It's different then download booster. 
im glad you asked, i really want one but i dont want to pay the samsung premium for one. Please post an update if you find one.
I believe the new Google cardboard supports phones this size, it's cheap and the quality of the experience is only slightly worse than your other main option, the Gear vr, which if I remember correctly costs $149-$199.
The flying blue theme does not come with the option to change folder color.
I have trouble with the fingerprint scanner. It isn't as fast or as accurate as the iPhone or the new Nexus devices.Still better than the abomination that was the Note 4 and S5. Hopefully Marshmallow improves the scanning with continual fingerprint learning.
They said its not covered on warranty and I'd have to buy one but their store is sold out
SwiftKey ftw! The best feature is the sync with your google account. I flash my devices very often and setting up the custom dictionaries from scratch takes a lot of time. This way it just pulls it up from your account and you're done. The only thing I wish they added would be the ability to sync your current settings, themes with your account. 
Download the Netflix app in the oculus store. 
Turn off app optimization and no more pop up.
Wait, is that the silver version?  You monster.I guess I should add that it does look really good.  I like the contrast of the leather and the metal sides...  &lt3 that silver color, though.
I highly doubt it. While I know of an app that will open up the floating menu (requires root) the capture options only recognize pen inputs. 
Just wondering how the colors match up. Mines blue as well 
It's been a while since I was bothered by this problem but I've found the way to get around it is to not close the app in the app draw and to occasionally open kik up throughout the day. It might also help if you open kik up after running lots of apps as it could be that the note 5 is closing it to free up ram. Are you running the latest firmware update? 
Yep, exactly what I meant! Was on mobile at the time and wasn't sure how to (or if I could) upload a screenshot of that.
Just submitted mine today! Looking forward to that battery pack!
Wifi -&gt More -&gt Advanced-&gt Always allow scanning  Is where I have it.
There are modded apks for Pandora that allow Pandora One access and allow down loading of tracks as you thumbs up them.There are a number of Youtube downloaders you can find that will download only audio.Of course using torrents with apps like Utorrent and Flud is also an option.
Turn off power saving mode. If that doest work reset your phone. It's not supposed to stutter. 
While charging, when you slide down the notification drawer, there will be a notification about the charging.  It will say fast charging. Otherwise, it will just say cable charging.
The comes with a pen at the bottom left of the phone.  And it even comes out.. brilliant 
To be honest when I first got my note 5 I did all the package disabled, greenify etc to see what battery life I could get.  The best battery I get now is stock, simple stock.  Nothing disabled just use it like it comes out of the box, I have seen the most smoothest operation and am getting 5 hours plus set every day.
Note 5 is cheaper and has way better ergonomics to me.. All it took me was one minute of holding the edge to figure out that having my phone cut into my hand during use is not my cup of tea. The edge just feels weird. The only upside I can see is display popping out as they say, and if that's worth it to you get the plus but to me it just wasn't really a feasible device. The note also feels smaller thanks to the curved back, where's it's much harder to one hand an edge with the flat back. 
Never even considered the Edge+. I'm on a Sprint Note 5, and haven't noticed any battery life issues (granted I've only had it for a couple of days). Battery life has been slightly better than my Note 3, and I haven't really disabled anything except Smart Stay. It is also more comfortable to hold with the curved back, feels more 'premium.' screen is fantastic and the camera is great as well. The only thing I'm really missing from the Note 3 is Air View working with my finger (not just the S Pen). I used that a lot for work email and my calendar.
Two ways - hold multitasking button to load app list to split and tap to see currently open and click the multi button on the window (looks like two rectangles in top of each other).  To get actions and resize, when split screen there will be a white dot to tap in the middle.
I came for a regular S6 Edge and bought the Note 5 and even though the edge looks super nice, it really doesn't justify the premium price.  The night clock is the only thing I ever used and it's definitely something I've learned to live without while having the Note 5.  I'd suggest the Note 5 as being the better bargain for what you get and actually use.  And the battery on this thing blows my Edge out of the water.  After 14 hours off the charger, I was at 50% last night when I got home at 7:30pm. I am using the same exact setup on the note as I was on my edge and the battery is awesome.
Nice. I am implementing a new CSS theme for /r/GalaxyNote5. Its very minimalist design. I will use your sub-reddit pic each week and post it on the sidebar (Much like the current pic at side bar).
I'm using this one, the plastic and rubber feels high quality and it keeps the phone very thin. http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B010MWGM0W?redirect=true&ampref_=ya_st_dp_summary#immersive_view?1451902125058
This is for the GS4, but may be the issue. I don't really want to dick around with my router. But, it seems that if you change the setting for the N band you can connect to it.

The material black theme from the galaxy store makes your keyboard like that
Depends on what you mean. You mean free songs or pirating music?
Sprint has a lot of preloaded crapware on their phones. You should be fine getting rid of all of the Sprint apps. I am able to easily get 1hrs of usage with my T-Mo Note 5. That's during the day, over night, the battery doesn't drain more than 10%.Disabling the apps would never brick the phone as they aren't actually being removed and none of the Sprint apps are essential to OS function. http://i.imgur.com/XzjAzvi.pngMake sure your sync accounts are syncing properly.
Have you tried it? It's nice to be able to sit in bed and plug in headphones, watch a movie on a large screen, and not bother anyone. Beats watching it on the phone. 
Thanks for my new wallpaper ???
Of those three, the only one I use is the fingerprint scanner. It was amazing until recently (for some reason I find myself wearing gloves a lot these days). It works like a charm: first try and it's quick. Sometimes I question if it's actually scanning my print or just sensing that a finger is there because it works so fast, but then I'll try a finger that I haven't registered and it won't work. 
Haha yeah, I was just pointing out that when looking before you take a picture what you see is definitely not what you get. 
For activating and using Samsung Pay.
FWIW I started with the LG and returned it within a week for the Note 5.  I liked the layout and concept well enough (a lot, actually), but that 808 processor is sort of a POS.  Tons of UI lag - like my finger would slide halfway across the screen before anything started to scroll.
No wrist strip and no idea if it will work with tempered glass case, but I love my [Spigen Slim Armor case](http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B010MWHIKA/ref=mp_s_a_1_14?qid=1452794226&ampsr=8-14&amppi=AC_SX118_SY170_QL70&ampkeywords=note+5+spigen&ampth=0)  (and it cost less than $20).  I've dropped mine several time (on bathroom tile twice) and it's held up fine. 
The s pen scratched my screen protector. I had the grey tip in it.
On the product page, click 'Other Sellers on Amazon' and select the one from Ringke Official Store and not the one that says Fulfillment by AmazonMust pick the one that offers free shipping from Ringke in order for the promotional code to applyOnly the colors listed are on sale Which in this case is black. Not bad for 2 bucks! 
yeah but one drop can also ruin the looks of the Note 5
The battery being androids fault is a silly concept at best. As noted a rogue all is likely the issue this is probably ( not guaranteed ) caused by bloat added by a carrier or samsung. This is likely a carrier / manufacturer issue. Additionally if we are going to make this an ios vs Android rogue apps issue then deal with the actual os advantages (root etc. ) if we want to purely discuss out of box experience and you want to compare Android and ios don't use a phone so ridiculously skinned and locked down on carriers. 
Switching to Note 5 from iPhone 6 in a couple of days. The main concern is the battery life. I have used plenty of android phones and i found out that the iPhone has the best standby time. My last Android phone is Galaxy S6 which is just fucking horrendous. I have disabled everything and it will still drain completely in less than 12 hours without any actual usage. I really hope this time it will be different. 
Shame it doesn't work on the clear one. I like the Ringke Fusion a lot for its size and plugs for USB and headphones, neither of which I use.
There are a lot of things it could be, and unfortunately it's very hard to tell exactly what wakelock is holding your phone awake without root. What do battery stats say about power consumption, and have you tried installing GSAM?
I got the Ringke Slim and it's already starting to crack after less than one day above the volume buttons. Seems like a poor design because it's so thin there. I'll be returning to Amazon as soon as my replacement shows up tomorrow. I'm trying the Spigen Thin Fit. I had something similar on my nexus 5 that held up great for 18 months.Edit: The Spiegen feels much better in my hand vs the Ringke. Both are a little slippery so they might be problematic for people with smaller hands. The Spiegen is MUCH easier to get the S-Pen out of than the Ringke but I miss the sexy gold color.
Click the home button and then keep your finger (lightly) pressed against the button.
That happens to me. It is very sporadic and I have yet to find out the root cause. It did happen to my S6 Edge as well.Just out of curiosity, what carrier are you on?
I'm in the same exact boat as well, also with AT&ampT. Same thing happened with the chat and escalation as well.
Has it worked for you with both Hangouts messages and SMS to non-Hangouts users? 
IMO the Note 5 has really disappointed me. Battery life was the biggest reason I switched to an Iphone 6. Battery draining overnight by 25% while apps are closed and location off was really bad.I would hold off but its up to you.If they wouls fix the battery problem id go back but i dont see it changing :(
Was going to come in and say the same. Disabling Face Provider does this and also caused my Gallery to crash anytime I did any action in it. 
My record is ~7 hours and 4mins. On reddit the whole time with screen brightness at ~30%
The difference in size is actually quite noticeable. The Note 5 feels like a much smaller phone, but the 6P still feels like a big phone. 
I had this particular issue too. Turned out that the charger cable had a pin that was damaged. Replaced it and haven't had trouble since. Have you got a different cable to test out? 
Just started showing up for me from my flashlight app, Apus Flashlight.
Gear VR is a $10consumer level virtual reality headset that works with very recent Samsung phones (S6, Note 5, and a few others). It's awesome. Movies (Netflix!), games, experiences, 36degree photos, YouTube (via sideloaded player)...it's fantastic. Check out /r/gearvr. The Note 5's fast charge makes it pretty easy to very reliably get through a full day and evening if you can spare a few minutes on the charger. During the day I'll wear the phone down to 40-60% and put it on the fast charger for 15-2minutes around 4-5pm and bump it up to have a reliable charge through the evening.
I completely agree.  Your picture is what shows for [us](http://imgur.com/KzmGdyo) after we click on Battery Usage.
Is your album sorted correctly by the date, device date time is correct?  That time I send my device to service centre without simcard my date is messed up, took some pictures wondering where is my pictures gone. 
Same here... I wished I would have spent the extra $ for the 64gb. Sigh.. 
I'm actually still in the set up. It's asking me have my screen lock or not, but I have to double tab every button and it's very difficult to do. Also I can't seem to simply restart the phone or power or off either.
Yes, stock camera app with no special settings. 
http://i.imgur.com/W9e3Uwt.pngNova launcher. I organize my apps into these categories to make searching for them as fast as possible.
Did this and it still isnt working. Its only on that screen/app though. With the phone unlocked the pen works as normal. 
&gt I hope they refine it again next year so it could be a mini mouse cursor. Imagine being able to use photoshop or write clearly and concisely on an image for work.You already can do those things.&gt Some things are annoying I was hoping to have a different wallpaper (lockscreen and home) after standby but apps can only do homescreen.You can do that. 
I wish case descriptions would start stating whether or not they are compatible with Samsung Pay and wireless charging. I don't want to spend a bunch of money on a case I'll just have to take off all the time. Yet these compatibilities are rarely mentioned in descriptions and reviews :/
Any way to avoid that build up of dust and debris on the edges??? It's the only reason I took mine off
Oh wow, my understanding was that no one had been able to get around Knox on the S6 or Note5. Good to know.
I honestly don't know. I think they are still in the making because the note 5 is relatively new. You could just get some duct tape, an external battery, a very small usb cable and a normal case and strap the battery to the case and use the small cable to connect both /s
I thought I wasnt going to like it. I was really really bummed out when I found out there wouldn't be an SD card and especially a removable battery. But after having it since launch I've now come to the conclusion that it's definitely my favorite phone I've ever owned. It's so fast, so smooth the camera is amazing and stores photos in the blink of an eye. The battery life could be a little bit better but it seriously hasn't been an issue and I use my phone constantly. I would recommend this phone to anybody.Edit: dictation corrections
Probably the video calling update mentioned here:http://newsroom.t-mobile.com/issues-insights-blog/video-calling.htm
There are other apps that will check for root, but I agree, Samsung Pay is really the only one that matters at all.
I also have Sprint and was using textra. Quick compose and reply didn't work. Uninstalled and started using the stock messaging app and I love it. There's no quick compose, but there is a quick reply. I also think it's a rather nice layout after getting the dark material theme :) 
...but if you stop the installation incorrectly by removing the batterytoo soon T-Mobile. Too soon.
I had this problem.   Initiated a return through Amazon and the next day, AT&ampT releases a OTA update and now it's working flawlessly.  Now I have the triple coil Choetech one by the bed and the Samsung one on the desk. 
I second this.  An update is badly needed. 
It's an effect of the new Hangouts (since the layout change). They've become a lot more aggressive with their compression and it's really awful. It also messed with displaying gifs on phones.  It sucks to have to send pictures via standard MMS so that they aren't compressed to hell.
I've been having other weird issues with Hangouts like sms messages not sending and disappearing after I've pressed send. 
I got a Note 5 from Costco with a $15Costco cash card making it essentially (since I do a LOT of shopping at Costco) a $550-ish phone. 
Google Play Music is ass on its own though
tempered glass screen protector, skinomi clear matte skin on back. Looks like I've got nothing on the phone and protection is good
Is this for a certain app? Or just in general whether that may be an email, text message, fb message, etc?
Yep, Samsung calls it Adaptive Fast Charge or something but at the core it's still Qualcomm tech. 
As long there's a notification  from any apps such as fb, twitter or whatsapp it will ring like every 5 sec 
Boa does not support updating their online banking for current charges / deposits either go figure.
Check the notification reminder. There's an option where you can set the phone to continually remind you of notifications until they are cleared. Just search notification reminder in the settings. 
Most likely since Metro uses T-Mobile's network. If you want a more definitive answer, you could call MetroPCS. Or google what bands you need for Metro and see if the Note 5 has them.To set it up Google the following:SIM Unlock T-Mobile Note 5MetroPCS APN Settings
It's part of the heart rate sensor too.
well, that is the last time I buy a case on a short time frame. Ran into my cell providers store to grab a case for the long weekend here in Canada. While it provided good protection and looks for the weekend, I simply cannot get over not being able to use the s pen to its full potential. Returning today.The case is the Strong N Free Berlin model for anybody that wants to learn from my mistakes.http://www.teqtronix.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/small_image/270x270/170ec19af00183b5e0368529fc2daa2f/b/e/berlin_black_1.jpg
Yep Id like to third this - Ive been an Android user, tried an IP6+ for a year, and although I loved the experience, it was just too restrictive. I was really worried about the fingerprint reader because I had basically become reliant on it and I knew earlier Samsung readers werent that great. Sure enough, my note 5 works perfectly. I cant tell any difference between its accuracy and my IP6+.
I got a thin, clear case for mine, somewhat unnoticeable even and has dust covers.Can barely see my screen protector too and that's only if I point out the edges of it. 
I tried one of those, as I used them with great success on other phones in the past. It is very high quality, but unfortunately it does not work well with the S-pen. Due to the soft nature of the Skinomi plastic, it is easily dented/damaged. Writing on it immediately leaves marks that stick around forever
There's a clear case on amazon for like $12 that I use, came with a free screen protector too and I love it
This was happening to the display models at one of my local VZ stores.  They had no idea why it was happening.  I had to point out the magnetic stand was causing it. 
It states on the packaging that it affects stylus usage. If your like me and only use it for navigation, stick it to a cheap case for your car rides. I've got a nice case on it for when I'm out of the car, but a cheap case holds it perfectly fine in the car. Might be a different story if you use the table mount one though. 
Download adobe acrobat reader.  Its not a bad app and lets you do this.
I'd agree. I have never dropped a phone. Maybe fell off my bed, but that's it.  Never got close to cracking my screen. Almost 2 years in
i am in the same boat my friend, i literally just noticed this inch scratch on my phone. idk how i did it, havent dropped it or have had anything touch the screen besides the pen. i HATE having a scratch on the screen or such a brand new, beautiful phone. 
i didnt get a screen protector that was the first mistake...
My local Tmobile has at least ten different cases, I bought 3 so far.
Negative. I always leave my GPS off unless I need to use it because of the battery drain
Yeah, I am going to another store tonight to talk to someone else in person....I did a search here and it seems the 64GB is semi-rare. :(
What if you do a longer command? Such as sending a text. Okay Google, text Dan I'm on my way now, my phone's dying, be outside at 9:30pm My phone screen would shut off before I finish. Not for you? 
I actually got a chance to talk to the CEO of LoopPay the other day, he told me that not all banks will be on board right away. I think he mentioned for example that Chase wouldn't be included until October or November...
Man I actually love that small screen pop-up for the calls instead of full screen. I don't always answer people's calls and it's a great way to just ignore them without denying the call.
Did you break it by mistake, or did it break through normal use?If it's the latter, I'd just get an exchange.  If not, Amazon sells them:http://www.amazon.com/Original-Samsung-Verizon-T-Mobile-US-Cellular/dp/B014F0ISTU/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&ampqid=1442531473&ampsr=8-9&ampkeywords=galaxy+note+5+spen
Thank you so much! Looks like the note 5 is in contention. the note 4 was so bad I stopped taking pictures with people.  How sad!
You can add whatever you like to the personal dictionary. 
might it be the charger? I've been using a cheap qi charger from Amazon and the Duracell pma charger and it works fine with mine
Here's the deal. I think Samsung fucked up the software or something but you need to initiate charging by setting the phone on the charger just right. I had the same issue, but once you get the hang of it it will start charging every time, it's just a matter of laying it on the right way. Try turning your phone on and unlocking it and fiddling around with positioning -  you'll see there's a trick to it and it comes down to the charging only initiates if you set it down in the right position.It a super annoying issue that I hope gets fixed soon.
Oh you use WiFi Calling? I've had them reset everything on their end to reregister me on the network for WiFi Calling and that did help at one point when I had delays on SMS due to that. 
oh lovely. I don't get many notifications because I'm one of the biggest losers you'll ever have the pleasure of encountering ... but one of the primary functions of these fucking smartphones is to push notifications to us. How have Samsung managed to fuck this up?
I found that I got similar battery life to my s6, sometimes even falling below the s6. I enjoy the pen but I don't think I'd buy it again
yup, twice.  Must have been the s pen, I switched tips on it just in case and got a screen protector.
I was really worried about battery life but I've been getting maybe close to 2hours or so which is great for me. I don't play games or watch videos much though which make an impact. I use bacon reader for reddit
What is a Knox counter? 
I play games, videos ect a lot.  I often use Bluetooth for music while at work too.  Getting 10-11 hrs per charge right now, which for my usage is not horrible but I'm always looking for ways to improve it without dramatically decreasing power 
Phone Radio is always one of the highest consumers on my phone. 
I've noticed no problems and I have a couple of different chargers. Try out one of these chargers: http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&ampfield-keywords=3+coil+wireless+charger&amprh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3A3+coil+wireless+charger that has 3 coils and has a lip to keep it in place.I have 2 Tylts and one of the generic ones in that search above. It might be that Samsung did something that causes the coil to be a little more particular about placement. Perhaps this magic tech for Samsung Pay?Even if it ends up not being the charger and you have to replace the phone, $2for one of the ones above is not much and they are good chargers.
It only shows when set as the background for the lock screen and it doesn't happen every time but maybe one out of five times when I wake the screen. I've only had the phone for 5 days so haven't tried other images but I'll try that today. 
Im probably sitting at an average of 5 SoT with Amplify and Greenify. I'd be curious to get a look at your set up just to compare..
Been trying to get it working with Verizon and AMEX.  Finger pointing all around.Called Samsung did all the technical uninstall/reinstall stuff.  They told me the problem was on AMEX's end. Called them, got their internet support team who was able to see my attempts coming in, which sounded reassuring.  At first they thought they were failing to send me an authorization code.  After they looked into it they claimed Samsung was not completing the link.Back on the phone with Samsung...
I wanted the 64gb version but it was sold out so I ended up getting this 32gb. So far besides system memory I've only used about 5 gigs, mostly apps. Books and Music I mostly store using Google apps and only download the ones I need to save space. I do use a bit of other cloud storage apps but not really that much. I don't often take photos or videos so those don't eat up to much space. I also have a tablet so things that would probably take up more space on my phone I usually use there because of the bigger screens. Examples would be videos/Movies, manga, and comics. So far 32gbs seems to be enough but I think that has more to do with how I use my space than it being enough space. I've only had the phone for about two weeks so we'll see if that changes.
Whoa, I didn't know Samsung pay could just use the magnetic strip. That's pretty awesome... Though I haven't actually used the magnetic strip on credit cards in years, at least it'll be widely accepted. Anyone have links to how this tech works? It's really interesting to me... Now I just gotta wait until Samsung pay comes to Canada.. 
The Note 5 is very different than previous versions.  As far as variants of Note 5 across the world I have not heard that they are different. There are plenty available from EBay and Amazon for about $30.00.
I muttered to myself are you kidding me after hearing the sound when you tap the dual window button. You can't even avoid that one unlike the ones you mentioned. 
Right, and look how long it took everyone to get lollipop.  The original moto x just got it a couple months ago.  Samsung isn't worse than any other mfg for general speed of updates. Verizon on the other hand always seems to take longer than everyone else
(T-mobile model) I'm getting about 13 hours after turning all bloatware off, NFC off, wifi calling off, etc. I really am tempted to switch to a custom rom I'm already missing custom roms.
Try the dark mode in Reddit is Fun. Make sure you turn on the option for true black for amoled phones  
Lucky thag you are able to get the silver! I got the gold one. But I use the s-view case with no issue. Really any case that isn't too thick should work.
I'm looking at the picture, saying I didn't know it could put stuff in the pictures!  I'm putting dragons on EVERYTHING
With Google Now, it is.  S-Voice listens while the screen is off, though.
at 2 or 3 years they would charge you to replace the battery or do it yourself.   https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Samsung+Galaxy+Note5+Battery+Replacement/51173  http://www.witrigs.com/oem-battery-for-samsung-galaxy-note-5
http://imgur.com/a/NnSP2couple NSFW ones -) the ones with the TV on were only two second exposures, that is why they suck. The ones with the TV off were ten second exposures - I think I did pretty well!Thanks for the idea OP!
I bought one of these a while back. They work great and have no bloatware to remove from. A word of warning: features such as VoLTE and wifi calling will not work on this model for anythung but Australian carriers because those features require carrier roms. Also this particular listing says the phone only comes with a UK charger.
Looks like all tones are dead. Went to change my ringtone and none of them work either.
I'm not the OP.  I can get up to 5 hours SOT.   I rarely use Wi-Fi (I have an unlimited data plan).  I always have blue tooth on.  I always have the location service on (power saving, no GPS).  I rarely play games.  I don't make too many calls.  I do use audio (Pandora, spotify) and video services (youtube) a lot.  I use Flipboard and Samsung's browser (Opera for Facebook).Reportedly, Chrome is a battery and/or processor hog on the current Samsung devices, so I've disabled it (can't remove it).I don't have the FB app.  I've disabled most of the bloatware without disabler pro or any other external app.The only cleaning app I have is CCleaner.  I let Android do its ram management thing.   Why am I listing these things?  I don't know, maybe so you can compare what I'm doing to what you're doing.
Which carrier are you on?[My Verizon Note5 always shows what type of mobile connection it has](http://i.imgur.com/6Ecwb3i.png)[Even when mobile data is disabled, it shows what kind of mobile connection it has](http://i.imgur.com/0VgACeQ.png)
I get 6hrs sot with a light theme and 7+ with a dark.  Make sure Google location history is turned off, it's in location settings.  I have one Google account synced with basic stuff gmail, calendar, opinion rewards, chrome, photos backup (only while charging).  I also have reddit syncing through relay pro every 15m.  I have wifi on most of the day and usually have a decent signal.  I tried package disabler pro and it actually made my battery worse.  Same with doze and greenify.  They both ended up using a significant portion of my battery.  I use a dark theme on any app I can.  I only turn on location, Bluetooth, or nfc when I need it.  I also turned off s pen detection, alerts, and vibration.  That's pretty much it.
So use the Google keyboard?I think Samsung's is pretty bad as well, as are most oem keyboards.
Sapphire here and actually, I had mine do that in that exact area one time as well. The rest have been on the right edge at around the middle of the screen edge. I'm now wondering how common this is as I tried researching online and didn't find any solid feedback.
It is not a quick charge compatible charger. Your phone will charge significantly faster with a quickcharge compatible charger. 
Mine is always at 50% auto brightness
I didn't break my screen on purpose. Sorry, i worded it wrong. 
Umm honestly not much. I used package disabler to remove a the apps I wasn't using, and I downloaded Material Black (a theme). It changes most of the interface to a black color, which saves battery life. 
What for, and how often are you using the gear VR that you ditched a $3leather wrap for it?
A lot of people suggest rooting, people did for my S5 too, but I am SO leery about doing it, worry about bricking the phone entirely, and since I still have a contract I'd be screwed if I did. 
I use the TYLT Vu wireless charger stand. Works great! http://www.tylt.com/wireless-chargers/vu-wireless-charger
I don't know if you were asking me or who. But I do have PDP. And I imported the extreme xml file that was on the guide of removing bloat on xda. Disabled TW launcher and I have nova. I usually have 2-3 bars on at&ampt. With power saver off.
If you use a different launcher, they won't carry over.
First sync your calendar on the G2 to google, so your data is not lost forever. Then connect your note 5 to this same google account and you're good to go.  If your USB port is broken, your only chance is syncing via a cloud service..
The LG G2 has wireless storage capability through wifi (which is how I was able to get everything else off of it,  including contacts).  So syncing with Google or some other cloud-based manager is the only way,  huh? Bummer.  Thanks for taking the time to respond,  I really appreciate it.
this may get asked a lot but any issues with lag or are things still silky smooth for the most part, and how often are you using the S-Pen?
No lag - I noticed the odd jitter with the S6 but this guy is solid. I'm using a material design theme from Samsung's theme store to tone down the TouchWiz. The screen is amazing. Beside it the S6 and even my ipad air 2 look poor. The Note has far better white balance and the colours aren't as over the top. I know I sound like I'm gushing but there's really nothing I don't like. 
So yes!  Although I still frostbolt myself to the face a non zero number of times. Pokemon shuffle is great with the pen too. 
I've used it to jot down notes and downloaded the AutoCAD sketch app. It's extremely fluid for me when writing or taking notes. 
I'm in live with that flat status bar? How do I do it? What's the best way to root the Note 5 and what is xposed?
Where is that option? I don't see anything like that in my battery menu.
Would you throw away your debit card once you added it to Samsung pay? I sure didn't. 
When I talked to samsung pay support, they seemed to indicate it just hadn't been released yet.  I hope that it will eventually be released and that it does have the MST transmitter. 
thanks. i think that you can answer this. I bought a N920I version of unlocked phone. i read in the xda-developers forum that i can flash the Australian firmware onto the phone so i can take advantage of Samsung Pay(whenever it comes out in Australia). my question is how to do it? will it void my warranty? will i get software updates from samsung after i do that?thanks.
Mine came with about 11GB used up for system memory so I recommend the 64GB model...
Would you rather I put your mom in the photoshoot next time?
Yup, happened to me as well. I thought my battery was broken or something, but it just happened once
The same seller is selling the Verizon version for [$1 less](http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0170ATZT4/ref=pd_aw_sim_sbs_107_1?ie=UTF8&ampdpID=41JiB9mkscL&ampdpSrc=sims&amppreST=_AC_UL100_SR100%2C100_&amprefRID=0E01A4094GRWR3RY22GP)
Mine does the same thing. I wouldn't really worry too much. Though for some reason when I use the wireless charger. The recent apps keeps opening and the recent app key vibrates like as if I was trying to open the recent apps when I actually don't want too.
It's so cool. The things I've enjoyed the most are thebluVR, Lands End, and Netflix/twitch/oculus social type stuff. I did the Titans of Space thing tonight and while it was really cool, I did find myself getting motion sickness from the way it flew you around, which is weird because I havent had a problem with motion sickness in anything else. 
Darker colors *will* use less power. Color #00000will use no power at all.
I went with the dark brushed metal. You? 
I don't use Do Not Disturb.I just set my phone to Mute and it doesn't make any noises except alarms.
I have a lot of my apps like Facebook, Instagram, G+, etc restrict background data so they don't show notifications all day unless I open the app or connect to wifi then they all start coming thru. This may be what you're experiencing 
That's weird.  I've had up to 5 hours on-screen time and not have to re-charge until night.   I only experience lag every once in a while (though sometimes it's really noticeable).
My wife and I both got our bundles.  Mine the Level and hers the Swarovski crystal case for her Note 5. Those battery packs are nice too.  Lots of juice.  
Neither wired nor wireless charging overnight will noticeably harm the battery.The charging circuit will fast charge from to about 90%, and then slow charge to 100%. Afterwards it'll only pull whatever current is needed to keep the battery is full.I haven't found wireless charging to heat the phone up any more than wired charging would.
~~Yes, just the glass. If I were to replace the rest of the plastic, I'd have to pry the whole back off.~~Edit: Whoops, I misread the question.
Are you on the same carrier as them? Any system updates needed? Or try updating PRL? Try going in and out of airplane mode too instead of rebooting. 
It sounds like u could get a replacement for free under warranty. My note 5 works great no shading or color issues on the screen and no soft spot like u talk about
Got the update on TMO, but USAA isn't supported. :(
If you rooted and KNOX was tripped, you're out of luck. Samsung Pay won't work when KNOX is tripped. 
How do you update the Samsung Pay app. I still get the coming soon AD. Samsung App store does not have any update. I thought today was the launch date?Edit: Nevermind, there is an OTA for the phone. I am installing now.
Super noob question. How do I get the samsung pay app on my note 5? I checked the play store and no dice. I don't see anything called the samsung app store on my phone?Edit, found it. Guess it's in Galaxy Apps, but the samsung pay app is invite only currently. :(
How did you update the app? I want to use Samsung Pay.Edit: Nevermind, there is an OTA for the phone. I am installing now.
Looks like they are no longer accepting Samsung Pay beta invites. FML.
Definitely, I really like it. I haven't had any major drops on concrete with it yet but I have a tempered glass screen protector just because I'm clumsy. I think it would fare pretty well though.
I called Samsung Pay support and they told me they are aware of the issue of the promotion not appearing or getting an error when trying to redeem it and are working on resolving it ASAP.Also they mentioned they are working to add Chase to their list but they don't know of an exact date yet. They told me to either keep checking the Samsung Pay website or calling Chase directly to see if they have a better timeframe.

I got nothing showing up under my Annoucement tab. I called up Samsung and they told me that servers are slammed and hoping to get it up and running before end of the day. The offer should be good for anyone with note 5. Can't wait to get another wireless charger.
I had that happen once, I killed the app from recent apps and restarted it. Everything  was back to normal afterwards
No idea on Quick Support, but if it doesn't work, maybe the built-in app SideSync could be used instead?
=/Spigen Crystal screen protector has been great for me.  I do want a back protector eventually, though.
Discover should be Q1.  You should check out the Citi double cash card.  I signed up for it so I could use it with Samsung pay.  I earn more cash back on everyday things than I do with Discover.  I like Discovers web site better, however.
Yeah, I had the Snapdragon variant of S5, I never experienced this in almost 2 years of use.This stutter really seems choppy sometimes and delay of couple of seconds is annoying when trying to quickly check a notification..
I did notice an improvement in battery life when I used an all black wallpaper but I went back to a colour wallpaper because I was getting 5+ hours SOT either way. Also there won't be a problem if you use a wallpaper with a lot of colours.
OP!! Try the dark theme! Looks so much better! http://i.imgur.com/Hd21ApS.jpg
And why is your settings black and orange? You used the theme store? If so, what is your theme? :)
You think thats impressive? [check out what I get with my note 4!!](http://imgur.com/a/0xriE#0)- lol to the butt hurt note 5 owners getting worse battery life than outdated technology..
Interesting, I may just stick with Google for now and work with it later when I get bored and want to play with other launchers
the maverick or the ash one? Do you have any pictures?
I have the Skinomi Matte skin for the back as well and it is far superior to the finger-print magnet that is the stock glass. It also feels a lot nicer to the touch
They bought a company called Loop pay that created this tech. I've seen people use a faub from them that has their cards on it. Samsung put it in the new galaxy phones. Google samsung and loop pay for a better eli5
For the Verizon guys who haven't seen it yet.  Can somebody tell me exactly how this works?  Can I use a different launcher or do you need to use home to swipe up the card, etc?
IMO the best:http://www.urbanarmorgear.com/collections/samsung-note-5-casesVery protective and is far less bulky than it seems.  I do see a lot of people recommend is the Spigens.
I also upgraded from a Note 3 to a Note 5.  My note 5 was getting a bar or 2 less in low signal areas than my Note 3 was.I fixed my Note 5's battery issue by backing up everything (photos, contacts, videos, documents, etc.) to my PC manually then performing a factory reset and restoring everything manually instead of using Samsung's, Google's or my carrier's backup/restore software.I simply went through my app history in the play store and re-downloaded all the apps I'd purchased/downloaded before.Now I get way better battery life with my Note 5 than I ever did with my Note 3 and my wireless connections seem to be better.FYI, you can export your contacts to a file from your contacts app, copy it to your PC, then import them from the file after factory resetting.
I cane from a Nexus 5 and don't miss stock Android much. I have disable a lot of the carrier bloat and use Nova Launcher because it's what I'm used to. I also use the Google Clock app and Google Calendar app because I didn't like the Samsung calendar and missed the clock working so well with my Android Wear watch. I really enjoy the Samsung camera software. It's miles ahead of Googles camera (which you can still get from the app store if desired). I also like the pen software. I mostly use it for quick screen grabs and writing little notes to myself. I do still have trouble getting used to a physical home button and find Google Now a pain to get to from the lockscreen so I don't use it as much as I used to. 
what happens if you reboot the phone? is the touch screen 100% dead 100% of the time??I'm asking because mine has become finnicky as of this morning. Sometimes when I turn it on the touch screen doesn't respond at all, but if I just toggle the display on/off (just short pressing power button) it will work again.
Probably not the same issue. My finger touch sensor was 99% broken 100% of the time (I say 99% because every now and then a touch would register, but not enough to really be usable).Also, the screen bleed was far more debilitating, since there was no workaround like using the SPen. After 8 hours, most of the upper half of the screen was fully black.
It is a good option. I'm not able to use samsung pay because Wells Fargo isn't supported yet :(
I hope you're aware as to how AT&ampT works with their shadiness. I just left AT&ampT for Tmobile. Now, you may be on a grandfathered plan that doesn't apply. I was on a 4-line family plan with 15gb data shared (not good). If you upgraded your phone and agreed to a 2-year contract, the line with the new phone had to pay $40/month for 2 years. If you bought it via AT&ampT Next, your line fee was $15/month for the duration of the Next plan (28 months usually). With Next, you paid something like $28/month for the phone, too.In the end, you're actually paying more out of your pocket than you would have if you had gone onto Next installment payments or bought the phone outright. At least, that would have been the case for me based on the line fees.
Coming from an lg g2 I absolutely love this phone. Great battery life, excellent camera and it runs fast. I let my wife who's had an iPhone for the last 4-5 years play with it for about 3minutes and she loves it. I think this may be the phone that brings her over to android. I didn't care for the form of the edge plus and wanted a stylus so the Note 5 was an easy decision for me.
I am aware.. I am on a family plan that I am lucky enough that I do not have to pay for (I am 30, yet my mother insists on keeping the whole family on a plan). The only thing that she cares about is her bill not going up. So by me doing the 2 year contract I pay the 35and the bill stayed the same. we were already paying 4or 3or whatever it was per phone a month. so thats not an issue.
I haven't noticed any memory management issues on my Note5, I also know somebody with the edge+ and no issues there either.  I read all about it, but I've never seen it myself.  It's wicked fast, all the time.  I can scroll through the open apps and am shocked how many are there- I don't even notice a slowdown.  On Verizon if that helps.
Of course they're currently back-ordered on the wireless charger and won't let me place an order...There's also this:http://promo.samsungpromotions.com/nopayments/I ordered mine on Sept 22, activated on Sept 24.  No Payments Promo runs from Sept 25 - Oct 9.  If I don't hear back from the promo soon, I'll be returning my Note 5 and re-ordering.
Absolutely. I had a galaxy s5 before switching to note 5 and I used to restart the phone every day due to ram issues. Note 5, on the other hand, had been restarted only once, and that too for installing an update.
Mine's the same way, but as an added problem, she's got tiny hands and loves the 4 screen on her current 5S. Heck, she didn't want to upgrade from the iPhone 4S she had before that! Since she'll never leave the iPhone, I'm hoping the rumors of Apple bringing another 4 6C in March or April are true or else I'll never hear the end of it when her current 5S dies and she has no choice but to upgrade to the 4.7 screen on the 6S.

Sprint Note 5 with MOAR ROM installed here. Not terribly impressed. MOAR came with adblock and greenify pre-installed, but deleted all bloat. Now I actually used Sprint Zone to pay my bill, so while I appreciated not having to comb through stuff, that bugged me. Customization is huge in this ROM, with tons of fonts and menu customizations. I really don't care to use most of them, as Nova launcher has met my needs quite well. I came from a Note 4 with Noterized ROM and I actually preferred that. It came with Viper (the audio booster), Synapse (kernel tweaking), and didn't look so... aftermarket. But this is a good ROM. No huge performance or battery gains as a result. I'll be continuing to look for a more well-rounded ROM.
Take it to a carrier store and do it in front of a sales person so they can annotate it in the notes on your account that a sales associate observed it. Heck if whoever services them is worth their weight they will pull the logs and see how many restarts the device has. 
http://imgur.com/XjAGUjUSame problem, right has finger print, left is swipe. If you find a fix, pm me!
You can set it to be the default tap to pay, Samsung pay works through MST and they shouldn't get in each others way unless you use NFC. 
I re-seated the SIM card and I haven't hae any more trouble with the phone.
I am fortunate enough to have both. I love my Note 5 and have it rooted and love the flexibility. But all of my friends have iMessage and FaceTime and the reliability of the iPhone is top notch. For my primary phone, I just want the thing to work flawlessly every time. No hiccups when I unlock, no reboots, no heating up, no radio snafus. Again, I'm fortunate enough to have both, but in my opinion, as a primary critical-to-my-business-and-my-life device, iPhone rocks. Glad we all can have good choices though!
If you have insurance......Here's what I did. I broke the screen on my Nexus 5, my deductible on that phone is $100. Since they aren't making it anymore they said they would send me a LG G3. I was like Hell no!. After enough complaining they sent me a refurbished Note 5. Not bad for $10huh? lol
The Note 5 can take RAW images which are incredibly good quality and are higher bit rate than a regular JPEG image.
It is a glass replacement and not plastic right? Tnx. 
Yeah, I've heard that Cell Standby on the TMO and AT&ampT variants are quite high. I know disabling VoLTE on TMO helped a bunch of people. I know with mine (AT&ampT) I disabled Enhanced 4G LTE services and it seemed to help. 
I just flashed this one today and haven't had a reboot yet, but I haven't spend much time on phone calls so I could just be getting lucky. http://forum.xda-developers.com/tmobile-galaxy-note5/development/rom-foreverlocos-breakdown-t3195427
Try the Spigen wireless charger. Best one I've ever used. 
I think the problem is you swiping the lock button. Swiping on the lock, locks your phone. Just swipe anywhere but the lock.
Note 5 for sure! I've been only using mine for a week and I really love it!I also have 2 work arounds for your issue #1. No removable battery - buy an external battery charger. Samsung even gave me one free (8000mah) with the phone in our country as a promo.No removable SD card - get a usb OTG cable and a thumb drive.
How many drops have you had where your phone lands flat on its screen? 
Other than the two apps i installed for heads up the only other third party app i use is themer. I got the phone as an upgrade from my network store so i hope theyre not selling fakes cos theyll have a massive lawsuit. If ur not australian u wouldnt know optus but theyre like at&ampt or verizon or sprint... so i doubt theyll sell fakes
What carrier are you on?  Does the time issue occur on Wi-Fi and cell data?  
I have Tasks under S Planner. Maybe try to create an Action Note, then set that note as a reminder and see if that causes Tasks to appear in S Planner. 
even with all the settings at the front facing camera still takes very strange pictures 
They create the update earlier and test it and then release it the next month 
Wifi, mobile, or both? If Mobile what carrier?
Samsung is so bad with updates... The Note 5 is really awesome, but it's annoying it's taking this long for an update while all other phones are getting it first.I really hope they fix the scrolling stutter I'm getting on apps.
I've been using mine fine with a glass screen protector. No difficulties here. 
I think it might have to do with heavy handwashing removing oil from your skin and making it hard to read fingerprints.  I've also noticed if my hands are cold, it has trouble too.
&gt I had an iphone 5 before going to the S5 (my iphone 5 just... started to fail). I'm still... on the edge about going back really. I really want something with a good stylus because I sketch/scribble a lot. How is the iphone 6 for battery life?It's pretty solid. I had a 6+ for a couple weeks before returning it and getting my Note 5. Battery life was good - though certain apps would drain it faster (i.e. Facebook Messenger). I mostly returned it because I couldn't stand iOS. The 6+ is a bit thinner and lighter and very responsive. The Note 5 has a much better camera and is more open so I can install Firefox with an adblocker. That alone saves enough battery to be noticeable as I'm a fairly heavy web user on my phone.I don't use the stylus a ton, but it's pretty handy for jotting down grocery lists, phone numbers and such.
Yeah, something about how shiny the gold looks a bit cheap to me... But to each his own! I got a black because they were out of white, I always get white phones and tablets, but I'm in LOVE with the black/blue. It's so unique. 
If you are still within your return policy, swap out the phone. More often than not, the wireless chargers are working just fine, its the phone that's not working properly.All these workarounds and turning on dream mode and what not does not change the fact that your phone is still not charging properly out of the box when there are plenty of other people who don't have the issue.Everyone wants to swap out the wireless charger because its easier to do that than to swap out the phone, but just swap out the phone and get it over with.I'm willing to bet that most of the wireless chargers that have been swapped out are working just fine and it was always the phone that was not working properly.
Don't carry emergency cash and rarely need it. If I'm unsure if I'll need cash, I have a stash in a safe at home or I can drop by an ATM real quick to grab some, not a big deal. Most of the time I will not go to places that don't accept cash anyway.Insurance cards are usually not all that important. Not to mention that most companies now offer apps where you can login and save or bring up your insurance card on your phone.Only thing I carry is my driver's license and debit card with me. Everything else is digital or only carried when I need it. 
Also the video calling is included
Without root, the only workaround I've found is the combination of Tasker and Autoinput. Basically you make a profile that automatically presses OK when those popups appear. I can't remember if Tasker is a paid app, but AutoInput is. I personally think they are worth a few bucks each, but it depends on what you do with them.I actually just swapped my phone today and don't have the profiles available, but I'll search for the reddit post that someone made about it and edit this to include the link.**Edit: added links.*** Tutorial: https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS6/comments/3gtts0/combating_the_pesky_high_volume_warning_with/* Tasker: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm* AutoInput: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joaomgcd.autoinput**Edit2: Some of the annoying popups you can avoid with this.*** High volume warning* Disabling data warning* Clear defaults (after selecting a default app EVERY TIME)* Delete picture confirmation*Credit goes to /u/AgnosticAndroid, who gives credit to /u/RatchetGuy!*
There was something about the screen turning off and the phone going into sleep mode... The t-mobile update that dropped fixed the issue... A workaround is going into settings and turning on daydream mode and setting it to when charging only. This will leave your screen on, so it's not as efficient as the wireless charger should be...but it will still charge decently and it won't stop until 100%
I have an ultra thin case for my Note. If I drop it... major damage will happen. But I can put it in on any surface and know I won't scratch the glass.
I think this is a bug. My s6 edge on 5.1.1 had the option to choose Once or Always. For now, this app is a work around. You might like it even if the bug wasn't present. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aboutmycode.betteropenwith
A starlit night. I especially love the keyboard, so many pretty colors :D
Is there some release notes on what the update is for? I woke up and found it waiting for me
My nagging had nothing to do with the time it was taking. I was expecting a long time. I was having issues with submitting two purchases, the website was throwing a fit about submitting twice. I called to get it resolved and emailed, and they replied with very canned messages so it was getting frustrating. No one was actually reading my question in the email. I never got called back, in 36 calls
[Here's mine](http://i.imgur.com/9n34u4X.jpg). Loved the Nexus 6P wallpaper so I used that, clock and weather/batt is Zooper Widget Pro, icons are Min, using Nova Launcher. Notification for whatsapp/Between is MissedIt!
I have tmobile and mines shows data connection while on WiFi as well
Serious question: Why the hell do we have to find things like this by accident? For example, I had NO idea that I could highlight and select text with the S pen until I did it accidentally. Why can there not be a manual detailing all of the features and whatnot of these phones?
Same here, I am on the family plan and had my 2 HTC M8s for only about 8 months. Traded them in for a small discount and got 2 Note5s on the payment plan and updated my data plan to the latest plans. The decrease in the data plan cost easily covered both phones and at the end of the day I have more data now than I did before.
fucking hell man! this camera is insane! 
ok. I guess all i can ask of you now is do you recommend wireless charging?
I have this same problem on my Galaxy S6. The upper left hand corner where the menu button usually resides for most apps have no action when pressed. What's funny is that a swipe from left to right on the edge of the screen works so there it is registering of my touches. Its random and can go away in the same day. But it is very frustrating. I can say that is it not the screen hardware. When you rotate in landscape with a compatible app, the upper left in landscape does the same thing.  
Came to say this. I'm hooked on Netflix for Gear. Very cool indeed. Best $10ever spent. I'd still buy it even if Netflix was the only app it ever ran. Virtual home theater for $100? It almost beats having a massive 4K TV if you can put up with the standard resolution which doesn't bother me one bit. 
Most people probably don't want to get rid of it. It does a good job of extending battery life.
White snow and light usually cause problems with white balance, so I prefer to shoot with manual WB in Kelvins and iso100.. but this particular photo was shot on auto, as far as I remember 
I feel like it is legit becuase they only have a select amount of devices on different carriers. And for any one to do something terrible with your imei they would have to work at your carrier. 
I have the Flip case. It is great. I got it for free as part of their promo a while back. It protects the phone very well, is ultra slim, allows the use of the oximeter (doesn't block it). and looks very professional. The only downside is that it is harder to use the rear camera because when you flip the cover it blocks the camera. That is the only issue I have with it.
Does ios allow bloat and skins? No. Android does. Does ios have to be hacked to achieve good battery life?  No. Android does. The nature of android is what causes faults in apps like rogue apps, bloat ware and inefficient skins. Therefore, the poor battery life is the fault of android. It doesn't get any clearer than that. What is silly is trying to rationalize it by saying it's not androids fault, it's only because android has all these other stupid things going on but if you hack the OS it's all good. Ios doesn't allow bloat ware or carrier skins and it works with great battery life right out of the box. They can pull battery battery life out of batteries a fraction of the size.
So I just woke up and the phone drained from 10down to 85. In my battery usage I see android OS with 4%, 2g by something Valley gpsd and 1% each used by Facebook, messenger, Google and chrome. That's it  there's nothing else. How do I solve this standby drain? This is like the biggest thing that bugs me.  
Wish it worked for the clear case.  I usually prefer black cases but since the Note 5 looks more navy than black, I don't want to have a non matching case.  Call me weird but that's just how I am haha.
Do you mean signing a pdf? You can open the pdf in Write on PDF to use the native pdf annotation tool . Alternatively, you can open S-Note and tap More in the top right and tap on Import PDF.If those options aren't available you will have to download the Extension Pack by tapping More and then More Features
The only way the S-pen could scratch your screen is if you got unlucky enough to have a sand granule or something embedded into the pen tip by accident. Samsung engineers are paid too well to design an input device that destroys the screen with use. 
Name literally one thing that I said that was incorrect. You can't. Allowing bloat and carrier skins is a function of android. Whether you think it to be or not. The battery drain of non rooted production software is a function of android. Therefore the battery drain I have on my phone is a result of a fault that android has. The fault being that it is open to allowing interference by manufacturers and other third parties to tweak it in inefficient ways. Apple does not allow for carriers to skin or add bloat to ios. That is a function of ios. 
Same here.  No way for me to get beta access 
There's Suretap wallet for Rogers/CIBC customers. It fucking blows. I have made so many phone calls to Rogers/Suretap about it - but I have never once been able to use it.Right now I have a prepaid Mastercard sitting on there that I can't use because, as soon as I got that set up and paid for, the shitty app decided I didn't have Suretap-enabled SIM anymore.Our banks and carriers in Canada are too focused on getting their own, proprietary versions of these functions out there. So no Android Pay or Samsung Pay in the foreseeable future for us.
Want the S-Pen? That's really the only question you need to answer.
Note5 all the freaking way.  The edge concept isn't exceptionally useful whereas the stylus is. I returned my S6 edge plus for the Note 5 after 1days. 
I'll unplug (remove from wireless charger) at 5am and usually plug back in around 1030pm with around 35% left.  So, use about 65% in 17 hours. No way could I even come close to that with the Edge I've had for the past 3 months. My signal at work is not the greatest so I think, a lot of the drain is the radio constantly jumping from 4g to lte while at work. 
I have 3 phone I jump back and forth with because I was undecided. I have a Note 5 , a 6 edge plus, and a Nexus 6. Of those the Note 5 is my favorite and the one I have my Gear S connected too. Even though the 6 edge plus and the Note 5 are Identical on paper in the real world they're not. For some reason the battery life on the 6 edge plus doesn't last as long. The 5 does more than the plus functionally and cost less. 
Well... They promised to update Note5 in December 2015. They postponed the update to February this year. This is a flagship device. I see no reason to an update taking this long besides incompetence. 
Log in to your T-Mobile account and go to your profile. In there you will find Media settings. That's where you turn it off.
Mine is 7hr 13mins. @35 percent brightness and 2 hour data usage.Edit: 7hr13mins was my average screen on time from november 27 to this date. My current sot is about 6hr5mins approx.I had bad battery life when I first bought the phone, 3 to 4hr of sot.Also sot may vary on how you use it, 33% brightness is enough for me because I work in a dimly lit environment.
Yea I had to ditch the standard app for textra for this exact reason. 
I'm still trialing this method (though it's summer holidays here in Australia so haven't had a chance to use it much). When you share from s note, it gives the option to share as an s note file, PDF, image etc. Which do you use? Choosing image seems to work well, though you lose the possibility to edit the text once it's in Onenote. It also seems to drop the quality of the writing (not a huge deal).Have you discovered any other tips and tricks?
I only have swipe, pin, pattern, password and fingerprint.
I believe that the software update step is mainly for s6 users. I'm in the same boat though. I got accepted and no install button. I've even tried clearing data from both Samsung pay apps in the app manager just in case and still no luck 
Same here. Received my acceptance email a half hour ago, but still no update available to the placeholder app. :'(
I just called in they said that my carrier (T-Mobile) hadn't released an update to make it work yet which is strange because my dad is using it fine on his Edge+. 
I know exactly what you mean. I like my note 5 but touchwiz has always got on my nerves. They have really improved on touchwiz on the note 5 but I still notice some lag here and there. I may have to pre-order tomorrow and give the moto x a trial run to see if I want to go back to the note 5.  I really love the battery on the note. 
I had the Zagg Glass for my note, it started to scratch the first day, and the edges never really sat right. And it kinda glowed blue in the sun light. I bought an IQ one from amazon, cheap but thought why not, and it had a terrible fit, I got rid of that. now going to try the Zagg hdx
same thing here. Samsung support told me nothing. Boo.
I mean I could have used the pen on the side while scrolling, causing the screen to scratch. 
It's not lag for me, just function. The touchwiz lockscreen in the worst thing ever, why can't I just double tap a notification to open the damn app Samsung? The persistent notifications about charging, WiFi, things like that also big me like crazy. And the quick toggles always showing when you pull down the shade. Oh, and their new way of forcing you to pick a default program the first time you touch a link or actionable item. 
Yeah, I'm on 1.2.1713. This is the latest version. Lol.
Ok I got ahold of Samsung support after talking to them they told me 3 to 4 more weeks! Who even knows if they even have a clue! I submitted Dec 17. 
Mine does even when watching videos or playing games. 
I like it purely because of the option to default to handwriting when the S Pen is out.
Same here with my Note 4!! I'm so glad I found this thread.. it's been happening to me for ~2 months and I knew it wasn't a hardware issue because a restart of the Android OS would temporarily fix it, and enabling show touches in Dev. options showed that the screen was registering my touches.
The front facing camera doesn't have flash. Do you mean the one on the back of the phone? If not that's damn good quality for the front camera. 
No I'm waiting on that one too. idk what the hold up is because they accepted my receipt a long time ago
I don't do anything special.I've been in a building with poor reception all day, and have 63% battery with 2h35m screen on time.That gives me a theoretical 6h30m screen on time.My device is the T-Mobile variant.
Oh it's just Gothic Bold. 
Cant be the SIM if it works on another device. Perhaps you forgot to plug an antenna in? I'd open it up and check to see if all the connectors are good.
Update started to roll out to S6 devices in South Korea today. Not sure when other variants gonna get it. Let's hope for the earliest. 
I use the Samsung Smartcover case, really nice and I can still see notifications and the time through it's window.
Try doing an update from play store.  How many days have you been using the device?
4 &amp 1/2 hours on Verizon. I have unlimited data so I never use WiFi either.
I was seeing poor battery performance as well. Then I noticed NFC is on by default... turned it off. Battery performance is much better now.
My phone will beep if it begins charging so it's very annoying to hear it beeping through the night.  I'm not sure what kind of effects that could have over the life of the battery though. 
Seeing how some updates like lollipop on the original moto x get pushed back a year,  I'd just be thankful we're still getting it in another month or so, could be a lot worse.  I'd rather it take longer and they get it right the first time rather than push out a bug ridden pos that kills performance or battery.  That was par for the course with everyone rushing last year to get lollipop out, a lot of people were mad about that too
To make things more difficult it only shows the last time it was ejected when the s pen is currently ejected, so if you look at the settings while you still have your s pen you would never know that feature was even there.
Hey man, how exactly did you go about removing the old broken glass? I see a knife there, but I'm pretty terrified that I'd actually end of scratching the camera if that's the case. I'm in the same boat and I'm trying to figure out if I should just suck it up and spend the $5to get it replaced at a shop. What do you think?
That does look really good, but I really like the look of the Note 5 without a case but I can be clumsy sometimes so I prefer to have a clear case on. But if the note 5 is fragile then I might have to go with a harder case.
Yeah I would imagine having that enabled would conflict with the fingerprint sensor and or Samsung Pay
I don't use a theme though 
Yeah it didn't used to do it. I hope it's just a software thing like recalibrating the battery or something. I've had to do that on old phones.
I think that benchmark is based on auto-brightness 50%.
That makes a lot of sense that app optimization would be causing this problem for dropbox. I'll give it a try. Thanks!
Same thing is happening on my Note 5. This also happened on my Moto X 2013. I think it is a problem with Lollipop.The solution for the Moto X and YouTube app was to tap the 3 dots in the top right hand corner. Open settings. Press the back button. And then press wait on theYoutube is not responding  pop-up.
For no reason at all my battery life went to hell. SOT at 45 minutes. Huge wakelock issues, I've factory reset my phone 3 times... Please help me. I bought PDP to try and fix it and nothing changed.
I really like that.  Good setup. What are the icons?
My point is that you can adjust the contrast of the lockscreen wallpaper to compensate for the overlay, so that it better matches your normal wallpaper.
Haha, what a dumb ass I am. lol, I been waiting for Note 4 update to 5.1.1 and I just lost it.Edit...but there was an update today...135mb or so
I...don't see my phone in any of my bluetooth enabled things unless I open the bluetooth settings menu.
Unless I turn on visibility, my phone is not seen by other Bluetooth devices.
Have you ever used Quick connect? The only way mine is not longer visible is if I turn off BT all together.
Maybe Its a bug in Quick connect? I used it with my Chromecast before.
Nope, never used quick connect.  It's actively paired to both my BT headset and my pebble, but I can't see it on my Mac or my tablet when I look for new bluetooth devices.
the Ringke definitely does. I have it and a SlickWraps carbon fiber skin on my Note 5 right now. I've heard that the official Samsung case does allow and it and also that the Neo Hybrid case does as well. I would assume the two heavy duty cases won't. 
My note 5 constantly turns the screen on and off on the wireless charger while I'm at work. I'm guessing because once it hits 100%, the phone completely stops until it starts to go down again. 
Im curious what you're disabling as well. I'm getting maybe 2.5 hours now with PDP and many things disabled (such as verizon bloatware, samsung email apps, but not everything in pink). Today with mixed use I'm at 1 hr 5min SOT with 16.5 hours on battery and literally just got the 15% notice. I used to get 4 hours SOT, but that was my max. 
Try turning it on/off from the notification toggle. If you don't have that toggle enabled, tap the pencil to edit and then check that the toggle is not on
Yes,  download the Groove music app.  Sign in with your Microsoft ID and you will see all the songs you have uploaded  to your One Drive music folder. 
Doze made my battery life noticeably worse.
You can download Samsung Smart Switch to your pc and then download the app on your phone, connect ur note via USB to pc and open smart switch on pc, you can then do a full backup of everything to your pc, which you can restore after factory reset.  I've done it and it works great.  Smart switch replaced kies
Results may vary but try this. Settings &gt mobile networks &gt network modeChoose 3G/2G instead of 4G.I'm getting 6-7 hours SOT now, up from 5 hours. My 4G was getting only 1 bar, so I think more power was used to maintain connection. For 3G, it's consistently 3-4 bars. 
I got my Gear VR for free with the Samsung pay promotion. Makes it even sweeter. 
No package disabler just app optimization on all but whatsapp and truecaller apps, brightness on full auto.
The Samsung theming engine uses a fuckton of battery. Maybe just try going back to the default theme as ugly as it might be.
that wallpaper is awesome. reminds me of adventure time. wanna post a link to it?
I actually end up turning off all of Tek's mods except Viper (which I can install myself) and edge apps (which is also on Darthstalker). So, there's not really a reason for me to use his ROM. It does run better for me than Hyperdrive and Loco, though, so I would use Tek if Darthstalker wasn't available. 
After 4minutes on fast charge you can fry an egg on it! 
Is that a theme from the theme store? If so which one? 
The last update I have is from December 15 (U.S.).
I on the other hand use spotify, baconreader for Reddit, texting, news apps and other low intensity apps. I'm easily going 2hours with ease on my battery life
VoLTE? My call screen looks like this http://imgur.com/2FG7Pvp
I take mine off the charger at 8am and put it back on at midnight. My usual day is on WiFi both at home and work with 4g between and at the customers site (not every day). I stream music from google play 2-4 hours, play a few games of hearthstone and a few of pokemon shuffle, read in moon reader 2 hours or so and twitter, Facebook,  sms maybe once every hour or two. I tend to use it really heavily in the evenings for a few hours as I don't really use my laptop at home. I've never run out of battery and with this usage I have managed 6 hours sot more than once. It's far better than either my old s6 or nexus 6 under the same usage. 
Material Design. This or Cards UI will probably be the top answer. 
If you disable all keyboards but the one you want to use, the notification will go away. Not sure if that's what you're looking for. 
Dark material.   But I got bored and set up a custom launcher, icons, and wallpaper too so only my settings menu remains dark
I get over six and a half hours,  and that's worth a lot of gaming and YouTube.   If I'm at work in well over seven hours screen on. 
This is closer to my experience than the other post describing 3 hours screen on time...
What's weird, though, is they keep getting reset, especially the Samsung keyboard. And voice to chat is nice. I was just hoping for a different method if someone had found a way. Thanks for the reply.
I actually had the edge + for about a week before I returned it for the Note 5.  OP hasn't responded to my other post asking if he will use the pen so I will give my explanation here.The Edge+ has a beautiful screen and that platinum gold color looked great as well.  When you're watching videos or scrolling through pages everything looked liked it was magically floating, it added a really cool effect.  I didn't see the curved screen as a gimmick because, unlike resolution, it was something you can actually notice and made everything easier to look at.  If I had to choose between QHD and curved screen @ FHD, I'd choose the curved screen everytime.  The only minor annoyance was accidentally touching the screen while I wanted to reach over to something on the left side of the screen.After about a week I realized I really wanted the s-pen and just simply took it back and exchanged it for the note 5, and I'm glad I did because I use the s-pen nearly everyday.  My only gripes with the note 5 is that the back looks worse than the note 3 did and that I bought an AT&ampT one.If you will use the s-pen, then get the note 5.  If you want a beautiful curved screen, then get the edge+.  If you don't care for either of these two, wait for the next nexus.
This came up as an error and wont record voice, same on whatsapp? 
I have the carbon fiber one and it doesn't feel as protective as I'd probably like, but it still feels durable enough. I'm thinking about just buying the Verus version of this case.
i'm on verizon and have a note 5 and it's fine.  it gets better battery life than my S4 did (before I killed it).  No problems with wifi and my signal is fine - same as what I got on the s4.  more anecdotes for what it's worth.
What carrier you with? I'm with att in a VoLTE coverage area and my dialer doesn't look like that
What about your note 5, does the s pen align with the phone body ?
It has everything to do with Samsung Pay,  first,  why would I keep the physical cards after I have entered them in my phone?  Defeats the purpose.  Second,  they should give a warning or include it in the instructions that once you log out all your cards will disappear.  What app does that?  What's the point of creating a profile? Now days 99.9% of the apps save your profile and info  you would think an app like Samsung Pay would  do that too.   It doesn't make sense to me. 
whats a brick? is it like a normal brick used for construction?
Interesting. I have huge fingers, but with Google's swipe keyboard from a few years back it's no longer necessary to even start on the correct key ??you just have to draw a line that roughly passes through all of the letters of the word you want. It's generally right on for me, with just a few gotcha words (e.g., when I first typed ??all??above, it thought I wanted ??ask??which wasn't a bad guess, since the same line passes through each).What does the keyboard have to do with copy-and-paste?
Mine is in the middle. The micro USB port in on the top of the phone. 
Should of been there on release day. I'm so sick of them not having colors available and then only certain carriers will have it or its only 32 gig model etc..  Don't care for iPhone but they always have all colors available day one and on all carriers and storage options. 
The best that I have found is that the S7 is going to be made to fully support the vr gear 2. Neither will be out till March. I am not so willing to wait 6 months for that to happen. I am considering the note 4 to also add gig to my phone for a better experience.  The note 5 seems superior in most other ways but the gear VR is what I'm really after right now. A tough decision.  I  also heard that there will be a show in Germany that might have some surprises for gear through Oculas rift and Samsung between the 23rd and 25th of this month. We will see
That may be true about stock Android not being so good on the note but not being able to root without flipping Knox is terrible.
I just called up my local sprint store and it seems they have an otterbox and the flip cover, and maybe a few other ones. 
I h ave the flip cover on my Note5 and it works like any other flip cover case with nonremovable backs, it just has 4 corners made of plastic and u just clip the phone in.
bluetooth definitely connects to my devices when I turn it on without me doing anything. Both my pebble and my moga controller.Also my google now works flawlessly from the lock screen (just tested it)
Im a student and i actually use my phone to take notes occasionally with the stylus and it feels really light for being a phablet.
He was very vague, my assumption is that its the 64gb and white/gold etc. 
Firstly, I can help with one.  You can disable the multi-view with [MultiWindow Toggle for Samsung](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.nerd.multiwindowtoggle).  It readds the toggle to your notification screen.My current list of quirks are as follows (T-Mobile variant).  These are from my post on XDA:* When sharing an image from a gallery, it prompts me to either send to an Existing Contact or new contact. So Samsung makes the first app chosen when opening a new file or link the default app automatically (one of the quirks I don't necessarily prefer, but I can live with), but then add this?* Cant share an image from gallery to someone not in contact list without adding them as a contact first.  To get around you have to compose a new message in messages and then attach file.* When in the messenger, tapping the paperclip to select an image attach from your gallery automatically sends the message. You can only select Send, there is no attach option. Composing text before attaching does nothing and the picture is sent and your text stays in the text box.  ATT variant has a done option.* Opening a URL in messenger prompts you with a the internet is scary message warning you of URL dangers.* Caller ID contact images for outgoing or connected calls are tiny.* Five variants of the Note device, and the dialer is still locked in portrait mode.* If im doing something, incoming calls show up as a pop up card with a double ended arrow to expand it. I can live with it, but i'd prefer full screen.* PayPal fingerprint support gone (though not entirely Samsung's fault).All of these things on their own are not problems.  The inability to change or customer is.  It feels like Apple assimilation to me.  :(Edit:  Lack of always-on capacitive button lights were an annoyance I had, but I used [Galaxy Button Lights](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.notquiteinsane.galaxybuttonlights) to solve that.
I'm actually on tmobile. Are you saying that I should go under data usage, then tap an app, then I should see the option to restrict data?  Because that's what I thought should happen except I didn't see any option for that unfortunately. 
What does auto brightness set one of two ticks from the left mean? If I'm reading that correctly, it sounds like you have auto-brightness OFF and have brightness set one or two tick from the left. Is that right?
Sweet. I'm terrified when I get my Note5 my kids will somehow find it and stick the pen in the wrong way.... I'm making sure I have all the info I need if that happens p
How? When I move the slider it turns auto brightness off.
Are you 100% sure? I don't mean to doubt you, but I just tried in quick settings and in regular display settings, and as soon as I move the slider it unchecks. Because honestly what is auto brightness if you can change the level?
100% sure. You're adjusting how sensitive and bright the auto brightness gets. Just took a screen recording to show you. Didn't realize it was recording sound so ignore that. https://youtu.be/6N-I3t5fUSQ
Watch the video I posted in the thread. Maybe it's because it's disabled for you guys on US carriers for whatever reason. I'm on the Canadian Note 5. It was the same in my Note 4, Note 3...Here's my phone info in case you guys notice a difference in our builds: http://imgur.com/lYaJN1VI am not rooted and haven't done anything like replacing recovery or anything. Still stock, nothing removed or disabled. 
Weird.  Maybe it is carrier specific, but that seems like an odd feature to block for some and not others.  I wonder what that actually accomplishes though.  
WiFi calling for Verizon is on the Galaxy s6.  
Stock Android (assuming you mean Google's base OS as opposed to Samsung's customized version) on a Note 5 would mean losing the S-Pen... so you might as well go for the Galaxy 6.All phones will get slower over time.My Verizon Note 5 has less bloatware than my previous phone (Motorola Droid Maxx). Package Disabler Pro makes it easy to disable most of the cruft. Installing a custom launcher like Nova gives an improved look and feel over the TouchWiz launcher.Can't really speak to your timing questions, since I have no idea what your motivating factors are. Why did you abandon Android for two iOS phones? What about that decision has changed such that you're looking to switch back? There's a significant cost to switching back and forth.&gt ...I sincerely have the way Apple is going with their products and choices, and the fact that my 16GB 6S is more expensive than most other flagships is a prime example of that.The latest iPhone has always been more expensive than its specs warrant. That's part of the Apple way??charging for (apparent) exclusivity.
It probably won't damage anything, but more resistance means more energy gets dissipated as heat. I can't say for sure that a 10ft cable will or won't do anything detrimental.
I've yet to find a use for the split screen. Other than you know, showing off. 
I swapped to a braided nylon charger. Also as mentioned, make sure the charger is a quickcharge compatible charger. It does not sound like your charger is. I think the worst charging cable is the one that comes with the iPhone. My wife breaks those all the time. 
Get a fast wireless charging pad and leave on your desk at work. Has been a godsend. Don't have to piss around with a cord during the day. 
Put it on vibrate before you plug it in?
Package disabler pro?On a sidenote what is that font and how do u get it
Try deleting Facebook and FB Messenger, restart your phone, then try it again
The phone keeps changing the keyboard back to the Samsung keyboard.
Unless someone can correct me, I've been using S voice to use the phone hands free. Like I can make a call using it where as Google now requires the screen to be on. This is kind of annoying and I wish the dedicated chip inside could be programmed to use Google now instead of S voice.
Yes normal 3G works. In fact because 4G coverage is so poor in my area (same problem I had with my previous phone), I've manually switched to 3G only. Seems to help with the battery life as well. 
Clock is minimal clock. Here's the wallpaper: http://i.imgur.com/uSwhfjL.jpg
That's the thing, I'm pretty good to my phones. It went into an otterbox on day one and stays there, I keep it clean, don't drop or throw it, the only real thing I'd say that's happened is it got frozen once, but I don't know why/how that would affect only the wifi, since I did buy a new battery for it less than 2 months ago (no change in battery life). It's weird, I've read there can be glitches in the OS in terms of wifi, but no idea how to fix it. At this point, I don't even really care anymore. How good is the battery on your phone? Also, what's gear VR? I'm not really up on the newest stuff so I'm afraid I don't know what that is.  
Unfortunately that's something I can't test in any way. I have no warranty on this phone. If it was a hardware issue, then the phone wouldn't deep sleep perfectly for a day and then start draining for no reason. And then it would go to deepsleep again and come out after. It really makes no sense from any point of view. 
Ohyea, Mine broke within a month. Its just a really bad cable. I am using standard cables left over from my last phone, but it doesn't quick charge anymore.
It's stuff like this that enrages me. I own a lot of Apple products, and I can easily say that their customer service is top notch. They've fixed several things out of warranty for free, and have enough retail stores around that you can have anything repaired/replaced within a couple of hours. Now I like Android way more than iOS, but why am I paying the same price for a Samsung device considering I get a lot less bang for my buck? I've owned a lot of phones over the years, and the only ones that ever give me hardware related issues are the Samsung ones. My Galaxy Nexus, Note 4, and now this Note 5 have all broken under no fault from me. 
Definitely sorted right.  Using Google photos too. 
I use the Swype + Dragon keyboard. I find its key layout to be pretty clean. The default Samsung keyboard looks so cluttered since you can see the extra symbols over each key. I also like Swype's swiping method for entering text and its ability to predict words and suggest emojis when appropriate.As for the text messaging, I like the stock app. It pretty much does everything I need in a text message app. I also like that I can mute notifications on specific threads if I'm at work or don't want to be bothered by frequent vibrations.
Hell yeah for Tasker. I have Tasker setup to go maximum brightness whenever I launch the camera, gallery, or any photo editing software so I can see what I'm doing and see the pictures in full on detail. Except, of course, between the hours of 11PM and 7AM. That shit hurts my eyes. But I love my Note 5 and Tasker and Android overall. Just came back after spending a year with iOS. I say adiOS!
I just bought my Note 5 earlier this week and traded in my 6 Plus. Was considering the 6S Plus but after my girlfriend got a S6E+, I was jealous of that display and camera. I used Android for four straight years and now I'm back. I can't believe I went that long without it. Apps like Tasker (/r/Tasker) are so freaking awesome that I have never been this excited about a phone before. I did enjoy my time with iOS though and it has come a long way. I had over 2Google apps on my iPhone and have a greater appreciation for the platform than I had before but I felt like I was faking something being on iOS. It wasn't who I really am. I feel right back at home with the Note 5 despite Samsung software. Once I swapped out the launcher and changed everything, I have it [setup](http://imgur.com/ZfhqSYW.png) perfectly. 
Might depend on where you start? I charge my phone for a few hours before bed and pull it off charge before going to sleep. I went to bed with 98% and after some moderate use this morning I'm at 88%. But I also activate do not disturb mode, so my screen isn't lighting up whenever I get any notifications. Just my 0.02. 
I came from the S6 and I've seen nothing but upgrade moving to the Note 5. To me, it's an obvious choice.On my S6, I didn't have any kind of grinding for the camera and I still don't with the Note 5. It sounds like you got a bunk device, but I might be wrong. The RAM management is fine for me, but people still complain about it on the Note 5. It has a gig over the S6, so that helps. I play games, browse reddit, use Snapchat, check Facebook, check e-mails, and so on and it does just fine switching between them all. I once returned to a game of Marvel Puzzle Quest after two hours and picked right back up where I was, whereas my S6 or LG G3 would have laughed at that.  The battery life is far improved in the Note 5. There are phones out there that still get better life, but I get about 16-2hours per day with moderate to heave use (5-6 hours of SoT). If I let it idle, it'll probably last about one-and-a-half to two days.I don't have any glare issues. I use auto-brightness and we have plenty of sun here, so I don't know.The small bezels took a second to get used to. The screen goes right up to the edge of the phone and I definitely have managed to accidentally hit something because of it. Once I got a case on it and just got used to it, though, it doesn't seem to be a problem anymore. Hope this helps.
&gt On my S6, I didn't have any kind of grinding for the camera and I still don't with the Note 5. It sounds like you got a bunk device, but I might be wrong.I used to think so, but it's turning out to be a relatively big issue. On just /r/galaxys6 alone, there's at least a post a day about someone wondering about what it is.Since the Note 5 appears to have the same exact camera (optics and all) as the S6, I'm slightly concerned.&gt I don't have any glare issues. I use auto-brightness and we have plenty of sun here, so I don't know.What about the super reflective coating on the phone itself? Like above/below the display. It's irritating as hell (to me, at least) on my S6, and I'm wondering if they dialed it down for the Note.Thanks for the insight!
&gtAlso, it feels like stock software is needed to get the most out of this hardware (camera, S Pen, magnetic strip emulator, etc) Exactly this. The S Pen feature works so well and anything but stock software will ruin its functionality. This will be the first Android phone I've ever owned that will stay stock... at least for now. But I have no intention of rooting anytime soon for the exact reasons that you mentioned. 
Galaxy Note 5 Case, OBLIQ [Naked Shield][Clear] - with {**NEW/Revised Version**}Kickstand Thin Slim Fit TPU Bumper Hard Hybrid Shock Resist Protective Clear Case https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011WD7WMM/ref=cm_sw_r_other_awd_QuSbwb9JV1P77
There's a bumper case within the hard plastic case. I like it. The only gripe I have about it is that it feels a bit slippery
Might vary by brand, but the plate I attached to my phone for the mount is metal, not a magnet itself, so there wouldn't be any possible interference anyways. 
I'm interested in this as well, and while we're on the subject, would the magnet interfere with wireless charging at all?
Haha sorry, I just saw the thumbnail picture and instantly recognized him, I met him not too long ago and we talked about Samsung Pay, his company being acquired, and the timeline for additional banks supporting it. He's a pretty interesting dude.
I may have to drop my barclaycard. These idiots think its a good idea to have their own nfc service and fragment the technology?
The annoying part is that they support Apple Pay, yet Samsung Pay and Android Pay support are somehow out of the question. They have really poor customer service and are terrible about giving regular credit line increases, so I really won't miss them much. 
I say yes x1000. I bought an unlocked s6 and after I put some new roms on it and rooted it, my battery life shot through the moon. I average about 5hr15 minutes of SoT with 23+hours of standby. No Samsung pay sucks, but it's literally the only thing you're missing. Also no carrier bloat and faster updates 
Any modifications to the stock ROM will trip your Knox counter, and Samsung pay is set up to detect that. Based on OP's post, I assumed he was talking about a modified rom, as the word unlocked is often used interchangeably. If he's talking about just unlocking the phone for other carriers, then he can just call and the mobile carrier who sold it will usually unlock it for you no problem. I don't know why you'd pay extra for that. Unauthorized (i.e. Without carrier approvall) unlocking of the phone normally does require a rom modification which, as I mentioned, will trip the Knox counter. 
I have the same issue with the stock app. Drove me crazy so I went to Textra.
Or you can simply press the button but hold it slightly longer than a normal press. Maybe 250ms or so. Basically just saying you don't have to let up and rest you fingerprint after the press because it'll scan it while pressed.
Make an XML backup of your disabled apps, then enable all and reboot.If your nfc starts working afterwards then it's something you disabled.
Thanks for mentioning the Smart Manager. I did simply click disable all bloatware, and haven't had any issues, except from Gsam not reading my battery settings. At least I now know why.
I'm getting about 7 hours SOT, but I have all bloatware disabled with Package Disabler. I turned off auto sync, and have my screen display on basic. I work in an area with shitty reception, and I can't be on just wi-fi at work, because I need to receive text messages. I figure that without Package Disabler, I'd get about 5 hours of SOT. That's fine by me. I'm pretty happy with the phone. Everybody is going to get different SOT.
32 gb. I have 2gb left. But I keep nearly nothing on my phone. I sync all my photos to my Google Drive. I use Spotify for music, Netflix for movies, and i usually reset my phone every month (sometimes more) to clear up unnecessary data. 
As a chase user what I am doing is I got a free checking account through Bank of America, I will just use that until chase pulls their head out of their butt and get Samsung pay working. That way I get to use Samsung Pay pretty quickly and I will still be eligible for the deal, I will just cancel the BOA account once chase is working
Most of those people getting seven hours of SoT are doing so by disabling sync and other features. The real trick is how to extend battery life without disabling any features. The biggest draw to battery life is the phone being awake when you're not using it. This works in two parts, alarms wake up the processor, and wakelocks keep the phone from going back to sleep. Disabling packages and turning off functions will remove a good portion of these alarms and wakelocks, but you can also do it without removing functionality through certain root apps. I use Greenify, Amplify, and Power Nap all running at the same time, and I get about six hours of SoT without disabling any functionality or any delayed push notifications. If you're rooted and want to set all that up, I'll show you specifically how I've set mine up. 
I was in the same boat as you. I loved the protective cover and didn't see anything like it online. I ended up going with the Spigen Neo Hybrid Carbon and I like it a lot. It did seem to add more bulk that what I was used to with my Note 4, but after a couple days I am more used to it and I like the overall feel of the case much better than the more slippery protective cover. I think the feel of the added bulk comes from the phone being curved along the back and not flat like the Note 4 because the Spigen case isn't noticeably thicker, when not on the phone, than the protective cover I had.
I constantly bounce back and fourth between iOS and Android and ultimately chose the Note 5 over the 6S+ because of how much easier it is to mod and customize things. Only thing I'll probably miss though is iCloud and Facetime. Other than that, at this point in the tech world both phones are extremely similar. The $12rebate and free wireless charger through Samsung Pay were the main selling points for me. Initially ordered a 6S+ in 64gb that was supposed to ship Saturday but they never did so I called and changed my order to a 32gb Note 5. I definitely did not want 16gb so it saved me a $10down payment. I honestly don't understand why Apple is still offering 16gb standard phones, especially in the 6S+. Ended up saving a $10down payment and will sign up for the $12rebate when it comes. 
No, the app works just fine. Actually haven't gotten it yet today so fingers crossed. 
I have a 32gb one since they don't sell the 64gb version where I live ??? I have 17gb left, all my photos synced with Google photos, and about 2 gigs worth of music.
it's like it thinks im constantly using the s-pen maybe ?  i can hardly hit the buttons with my finger any1 else have this issue
Plus you can use USB OTG for all your media that you always need to have on the phone! :)
I made the switch and literally the ONLY thing I miss is the stero speakers. Everything else about my Note5 kills my N6. Screen is phenomenal on this, the camera makes the N6 look like a potato and TouchWiz isn't that bad. I've been changing the theme of my device about once a week just to give it a fresh look.I'd say the battery is about the same. This phone has an average of about 5 hours SOT and I really do have a hard time killing my battery in one day.
Lmao the apple pencil? Why pencil of all things?
Your clicking mechanism must have jammed for some reason. The good news is that the click just extends the end out of the phone so you can grasp it and pull it out and doesn't actually unlock the pen. So, you may be able to us a straw inserted along the edge to either wiggle it a bit until it does click or to allow a better grip so you can pull it out. After pulling it out you'll be able to better judge whether the S-Pen is permanently jammed or if it was just a fluke of some sort.
It's a safety feature so your battery doesn't explode. Are you leaving it in the sunlight while it charges or in bed under sheets with you?
Looking at my AT&ampT Note 5 as I write this:  Settings&gtConnections &gt Mobile Networks &gt Mobile data &gt Uncheck Enhanced 4G LTE Serviceshth,crp
Don't think Keep supports inking. I suppose you could write in S-Note and export as an image, then import that image into Keep, but that seems like a huge PITA.Probably better off using OneNote, Evernote, S-Note, or another note-keeping app that supports inking natively.
Some wireless chargers seem to do that.  Try a different one.  
This started happening to me over the past week or so too.  I'll have 13% battery, look at my phone 15 mins later....dead.  Never had a phone behave this way before so suddenly.
If I had to guess... Remove  the back glass, strip the factory finish off and repaint the inside? 
I've used multiple screens by Jetech, never had an issue. That's what I currently have on my phone. Its [14$ for 2 of them on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014ASWICU?psc=1&ampredirect=true&ampref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00)
Rotate it
haha I wish. I bought another micro usb drive and it fitted perfectly. No idea why my old one doesn't fit. It looks exactly the same and fits in other phones.
2 month old post, I got a replacement from my warranty because it seemed like a software issue, but I'm still waiting on them to grade the phone and issue me a refund for the $696 equipment fee 
As a fellow Canadian, this makes me jealous. I hope they have something for us early adopters when Samsung Pay becomes available (if ever).
Maybe not the solution you're looking for but HeadsOff on the play store disables those pop-ups and makes them ticker text on the notification bar.
I have a two part incipio that feels remarkably small for a two part case. I also use a cheap Insignia case I found from best buy, mostly to protect the edges and back from any scratches, not for drop protection.
Absolutely, and the Edge+ has a little more than the note, but it's negligible. The Note 5 lasts longer than the 4 on a single charge, and that was already great.
I just grabbed the update too.  It said stability update along with security for me. 
Yeah but the problem is it's almost pointless to have a case that DOESN'T come up and cover the screen, since they don't protect the screen, only the sides and back of the phone which are more rugged
Yea I have verizon and I'd definitely seems like it gets less battery life and signal than every one else. Plus possibly no samsung pay, and no root. Thanks big red
Yeah I did the same with android pay, but can't do anything on Samsung pay
Yes I saw your post from the other day. Strangely enough, after I disabled some bloatware that was safe to disable, I had the battery issue
What's the cost?
I've been browsing the interwebs for a few days on this subject and people claim it's a lollipop issue that plagues some people. Someone suggested clearing the cache and rebooting. I tried it and I'm not sure if it's just coincidence or if it actually worked but here are the steps.1. Turn OFF the phone2. Press and hold, POWER, VOLUME UP and POWER buttons3. You will see the little green Android guy loading recovery screen4. Use the Volume Up/Down keys to navigate the menu and select WIPE CACHE PARTITION5. Press the power button to confirm6. You will see a message at the bottom of the screen when it is complete7. Navigate to REBOOT SYSTEM NOWSeems to have fixed my cell standby issue...for now at least. I was hovering around 20% usage before. Since I did this, its been 3% for almost a full day.
Let me rephrase my post, can someone recommend a cheap qi charger?
There is no cost.
I bought two of the [Anker units on Amazon for $12 each](http://www.amazon.com/Anker-Wireless-PowerPort-Qi-Enabled-Packaging/dp/B00Y839YMU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&ampqid=1442602206&ampsr=8-1&ampkeywords=anker+wireless+charger) and I'm happy, they work with no fuss.
Thats what the repair shop told me but no, not a drop of water on or near it.
Only approved Samsung creators are allowed to make themes to my knowledge.
is there any difference between the fast charger and a regular charger?
I don't have insurance but I did just crack my lcd front and back glass and Samsung fixed it for 166.67
Probably anything except the Apple Watch should work
So it only happens once, right when you put it on the charger? I'm wondering if it could be static electricity build-up  causing it. what kind of flooring do you have in the room your charger is in?
it works on my LG G Watch but one thing I've noticed is that you can't silence alarms on the phone through the watch like I could on my Nexus 5. I assume it's because the Nexus 5 used Google's Clock app vs the Samsung one. I'll try installing it when I get around to it, but it's silly to need mulitiple clock apps on a phone IMO
I use Zedge usually but right now I'm using a dark theme from the app store. I'm a girl so it has hearts on the background and it is simple and darker to (hopefully) use less battery. Not that I am ever NOT near a charger, but still.
I'm using stock everything with the 'Material Dark' theme and stock Lollipop icons with a custom wallpaper. I'm loving it and not seeing myself rooting anytime soon which is a welcomed change.
Not sure if this will help but I use Package Disabler to disable the Samsung Music player so I could use Google Play Music instead. Whenever the Bluetooth in my car would connect to my phone it would open the Samsung Music Player and start playing, now it auto plays GPM.
I have the flip wallet on [this](http://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/galaxy-note5/accessories/) page
Here's mine,  Nova launcher with Materialistik icon pack. http://imgur.com/Mur2tzp
**Samsung Pay is inconsistent!**I get errors like 5-10% of the time (high enough for it to not be worth the extra hassle of having to pull out a real card)I get employees asking to see the card like 5-10% of the time, and then there's no name on the card in the app and there's two different card numbers and it only shows the last four digits, so I have to be very clear with the cashier which numbers they need (they can't just look at it and instantly see what they need to see, they need coaching, which is awkward not only from a socially awkward perspective, but from a payment security perspective)If it doesn't work perfectly 10-20% of the time, I don't even want to try it. It's taking me LONGER to pay for shit on average now, that's the exact opposite of what it's supposed to do for me. I was getting used to not carrying a physical wallet, but I'm increasingly thinking I need to go back. It's not living up to expectations.---**Fingerprint scanner works great**I only use the fingerprint scanner for Samsung Pay (not to unlock my phone, I use no lockscreen at all) but the fingerprint scanning works quickly and perfectly every time, as long as I don't have my finger in a stupid position. I do believe it's slower than the latest generation iPhone's scanner, but it's damn fast, like less than one second.---**I don't use S-Note, but it's fine**I'm not a student and I don't need to write lots of stuff down, so for me Google Keep with it's homescreen widget is sufficient. I jot down little to-do's in Keep and they appear on my homescreen - I have some long term things like my car's license plate number kept in Keep's archive (things that are important to have quick access to occasionally, but that are never going to stick around in my long term memory because I need them so rarely). But I've played with S-Note, there's a ton of functionality and even some add-on functionality that you should look into! There was a post in this subreddit highlighting the add-ons a while back.---In general, I don't know how anyone can endure using a smartphone without an S-Pen! Samsung should just start putting the pen in all of their phones. It'll catch on once people realize how useful it is.
Another thing you can try, if it remains, is restarting your home router.After some power outages, it seemed to put my home's router into a confused state and would never let my phone connect with the screen off, singlehandedly bringing the idle drain up to 5%/hour
Yep. Had to reboot it last night. Couldn't work out what triggered it. You  folks all using TouchWiz as your launcher? I still am as I like how it looks but can be a little laggy. 
I'd say maybe a couple of weeks. Faster? Perhaps not. I never got comfortable with swipe style keyboards because of the fact that if I wanted to type accurately in the first place, I'd have to try really hard to get the tiny buttons right. I don't have huge fingers, but it's still a chore when your sentences get all wonky from tapbing something oh so slightly off, even with auto correct on. There are a total of 14 buttons in MessageEase. They're multipurpose, which makes everything so much easier once you get used to it. Less than half, more like a thirdd of the normal keyboard, but all punctuation, etc. readily available. One finger typing is easy, as you can shrink and move the keyboard around. It even has Voice recognition really easily available. Copy, Paste, copy all. . . lots of things that are a pain in the ass with other keyboards can be done with a simple swipe. . . something that no other keyboard that I know of can do easily. I have my keyboard shrunk so it's actually easier to type with one thumb than two. 
They include another option that doesn't cover the side bezels and another separate option with no button cutouts.I have mine done up with no sides and no cutouts. Looks way cleaner to me. Unfortunately, I put a thick ass case on my phone and I'm too lazy to take it out to show.That and I lack a second camera.
Protip: go in to your wireless store and ask if they have any fast charger bricks laying around in the back. The guy at the Sprint store gave me two. 
Which Aukey model do you use?I'm hoping to find a battery-pack that's got wired AND wireless fast charging(Note 5 supports both)...
Is your screen dirty as hell? This happens to me when I use my phone at work and get some grime on it.
I'm using the native app optimizer in the battery menu in settings. The weird thing is the only Google Apps being optimized are docs and sheets, yet for whatever reason Gmail notifications are not coming through until I connect to Wifi.
Which network are you on? How quick was the delivery from them?
Seems to run pretty well together to put it best without you actually having it in your hand, the titanium is colored about the same as the metal trim around the phone, just different texture, obviously.
No deep sleep problems. Lost 2% overnight while i slept. I haven't payed attention to my SoT for awhile. It varies so much because I'm on sprint. If I'm in a area with a shitty data connection (happens a lot with sprint) my battery takes a hit 
Just as a heads up, these packages will vary per carrier. I do know the TMO variant has different packages to disable vs AT&ampT and VZW.
Happened to me once. Luckily a strip of paper did the job and got the S-pen out. 
Go to dialer app then top right click settings and then go to voice over lte. And turn it off. That's the fix.
Unfortunately it is not. But your phone will definitely not die watching movies! 
My variant is one of those. I am on the December security update, still no marshmallow.
I've had the replacement since November and it still works as it should. I know samsung gives you a 1 year warranty but I went through AT&ampT.
You know...come to think of it I do remember having some issues with Hangouts.  So much so that I moved to a totally new app with zero issues.  Hangouts is a buggy pos these days.  Try Telegram out and see if that's any better. 
Try using AutoMate while you're in your car. It's a copy of android auto with a very nice interface. It works in landscape mode and also has a dialer that works in landscape.
I hate that too. My workaround is to never have notification volume on. My Microsoft Band notifies me whenever a notification comes in.
http://imgur.com/a/evvd8Finished photos
Should I send these pictures to Dbrand?
I switched to a note5 after using the 6p for a month and half and I do not regret. Sure the 6p Android experience is great but I like the look and feel of the note 5 ALOT better mainly cause its smaller even with same screen size and the spen feature
I helped you out over on /r/jailbreak. Trying to see if I can help further. Can you post screenshots of the settings of your hotspot?
Exactly my setup as well. I've dropped my phone multiple times and the bumper case has really saved my phone. 
Same thing here on Sprint.  It persisted when I disabled only the most basic bloatware though.  A factory reset and no PDP fixed it though.  Haven't random drain from Android System or OS in about a month now.
Had the same issue with my T-Mobile Note 5. Exchanged the phone, and same thing. Disabled chat heads in fb messenger and it seems ok now. We'll wait and see.
What app are you using to text? Some of them I have to go into the app itself to change the tone
Because this is Android and you can do whatever you want?Personally, after 7 years of stock Android phones, I absolutely HAD to switch the back and recent apps buttons before I could use my Note 5...
Had it. Wouldn't completely close once I installed the screen protector. Returned it. 
just a heads up, NFC probably won't work and wireless charging didn't work when I put the plate on my phone. I'm not sure if it would interfere with Samsung Pay because I didn't have it at the time.Those things might not be important to you though
Yes completely normal, as your updating and setting up for the first time it will take longer to charge and will get hotter, since it still wasn't done setting up everything after those few hours of charging you took it off and it still updated hense your battery draining quicker. Completely normal.
Samsung Pay: Anywhere Apple or Android pay works, Samsung Pay works flawlessly. Work exactly the way you expect, and no issue. In those situations, it's not any better, not any worse.Now the places where Apple and Android Pay dont work, but where Samsung Pay does work (old style traditional swipe terminals), Samsung Pay works &gt90% of the time. When it doesn't work, I think it is me pulling the phone away too quickly. I'm 100% on the second time around in these cases, so I'm thinking it is me, not the terminal. I've only had 1 place, Dicks Sporting Goods, where it just straight up did not work, but I think the cashier was messing it up so I don't know. Fingerprint scanner: Only issue I have with fingerprint scanner is one finger, my right thumb, that isn't always 100%, but I'm pretty sure that the issue is I setup my fingerprint on one part of my thumb (dead center), and them I'm trying to unlock it with a different part (off center, almost side). S Note: Keep in mind that I have pretty crappy handwriting, so it doesn't always catch everything, but when it does, it's like some future magic going on. I love the off screen note feature. I often use my phone to jot down something, or if I'm going to pick up some stuff I'll get a quick list of what I need, all without having to turn on my phone. 
I just have two major questions: can I still use Android Pay, and can I change the stupid giant clock, ugly mute/vibrate icons, and the ugly WiFi/data icons?
I just bought an armband off Amazon. I was hesitant about it since the phone is big, so I settled for a cheap one. I like it so far. The material isn't too hot or uncomfortable and if tightened well it doesn't move or slide around. Only problem is the case I'm currently using is too big so I have to pop my phone out of the case to use the armband. Here's the Amazon link:Note 5 Armband : Stalion?? Sports Running &amp Exercise Gym Sportband for Samsung Galaxy Note 5 [Lifetime Warranty](Jet Black) Water Resistant + Sweat Proof + Key Holder + ID / Credit Card / Money Holder https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013TKUN9K/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_GBk-vb50ZZVTB
is it a bug? on the back camera if you hold down the screen a little ripple comes up, I think that's what identifies faces on the front camera
I'll sum it up.  Same scenario as the author, but I've been with my T-Mobile Note 5 for almost a month.  Its better in some ways but either the same or worse in others.  If you're either a Mac or iPad user, you'll immediately miss handoff.  The screen is a little too sensitive for me, and no matter what keyboard you use, it will eventually start lagging.  Battery life is below average for this type of device.  If you don't use the S-Pen, you're throwing your money away, and might possibly be better served by a S6 Edge+ if you want a similar phone.I was a die hard Android user up until this summer.  To me, there is too much customization potential along with just as many things that can go awry, causing headaches.Power users will balk at this phone, unless you've had experience with previous Note models and enjoyed it.  The same crowd would most likely also balk at an iPhone, but I digress.  It is however, a beautifully crafted device, save for the glass back which is slippery.  This can only be negated by a case, some type of skin, or bumper at the very least, which, to me, detracts from the beauty of the phone itself.TLDR Close, but no cigar.
Alright so I went to AT&ampT today and they said apparently I cant return it because the store I bought it from isn't a corporate one. So how the fuck is it AT&ampT and why is the SIM card AT&ampT and why do I have you fucking bloatware all over the phone.
Yeah second day with the phone so i spent 55 on a screen and glass protector. Saw that it was spigen and thought not a bad price for the same cover i had on my S5. Im gonna return it once I get a better case I think.
There's an app on play store called Doze which helps improve standby until we get the real doze with marshmallow 
also, the pen didn't work when mounted in the magnet, but it worked the rest of the time. I never needed to use my pen in the car while it's mounted but it worked fine with my finger.
I was mostly pointing out that when looking through the camera app, what you see is not what you get. The picture you're lining up may look like garbage, but once you take the picture it might actually look decent because of the image processing done once the picture is taken. 
Nope. It won't even go into recovery now. I left it on the charger for 6 hours today. No combination of buttons brings anything up. Yesterday when I still had battery power, trying to reset just resulted in a boot loop with a corrupted display.
I just saw write on PDF was updated for 6.seems like phone updates won't be too far behind 
Yep, exact same thing happened to me. It got to the point where I would have to carefully pry the spen out with a thin object, even with the spen clicker in the open position. I took a look at the clicker on the pen and the whole back end just broke off. The spring tension is fine, it's whatever mechanism is being used to physically lock and release the back part that's failing. Ended up just buying a cheap replacement on ebay. 
My wife had this exact same issue yesterday. We went to Verizon and had the sim card replaced, and it solved the issue.
it happened yesterday, i rebooted and all was well. this morning it happened again, and rebooting/reinserting sim/new sim/factory reset didn't fix. can't connect to mobile network.
Got the same email today. Sadly I hadn't used the first one and when I checked the balance it shows $on it.
That's an amazing price. I got 2 when they were $5each and bought 2 adaptive fast chargers separately.  They work great and I'm sure you'll enjoy it. 
Aside from possibly the back glass (which some people manage to shatter), it's really not the fragile. I have only a faux leather skin on the back, and I've dropped it multiple times. The only damage has been a tiny scuff mark on the metal frame (?).
Do you use Package Disabler Pro?I had this for a small time once, I think due to disabling something the screenshot depended on. 
Thanks for all the replies! I purchased the 32gb golden Note 5 earlier today.It's unavailable in my country (the Netherlands), so I'll have to wait for it to arrive, but I already can't wait! 
Out of curiosity, what were you using to record your screen?
http://imgur.com/mi1mYBZPicture of battery life screen, because I'm still sorta a noob here and cant figure out how to attach to my post. :-/
My preferred SMS application is [Signal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms). If you are texting someone with the same app, the conversation is encrypted. Plus it has Material Design.
This app leaves a bit of a delay when you tap the home button. If you press home, it's near instant whereas tapping it causes a half second delay before doing anything. I like the idea of this app but the delay is definitely noticeable. 
Mine said that the Play Store used 2GB in the last 24 hours and the Samsung+ update was the first thing I've downloaded in the last 24 hours. 
If you use Chrome, enable the compress feature so it compresses content before sending it to your phone. This will save battery as it has to pull less data across the network and should net a little bit of battery.
What can i do with an ir blaster?
Sorry that happened to you but it really has nothing to do with Samsung Pay. You threw out the cards. That's entirely your own fault. 
That's how I feel too.  I use a launcher so don't care about stock Android and touchwiz has great features like multi window.
No. It's an odd concept, I wish smarter everyday could cover this to make it easier to understand. Your battery is not worst and it's not better. Lithium based batteries have no memory and does not require a periodic calibration. It's about how many times they are charged.  Lithium batteries do stress when left at a high voltage  (storing a full battery). A partial discharge will reduce the stress on the battery and prolong the life.  There is also a cycle life of how many times you can charge the battery. On average, you can charge a battery that gets to 90% 375-470times. At 75% 200- 250times. 50% 120- 150times. If you charge it when it falls to 0% every time you will only be able to charge it 30- 50times. This is all relative to how you use the battery. Take note, charging them at 0% or 90% isn't better or worst. They will last about the same amount of time. You would obviously charge it more often if you charge it when it gets to 90% but it's how often you use the phone or device it's connected to.Let's say you are at 356 charge cycles for 0%.  If it goes to 0% twice a day your battery is only going to last about 6 months. If it falls to 0% every two days, you should get about two years out of it.Batteryuniversity.com has some great info. Refer to everything regarding lithium ion. There is also a piece that talks about ultra fast chargers as well.Hope that helps.
For what its worth, I work IT for a company of over 120employees and all new phones come through  our department before being deployed.  We have tried every combination of initial charging before giving them out and nothing has made any difference.  Charge it whenever you want for as long as you want and dont worry about it, you're  good to go.

What color??
FYI its a lithium polymer battery and even more resistant to battery memory. 
&gt FBFound your problem.Was it a version installed on the phone or is this from the Play Store?
Which method are you using to take the screen shot?
So this is fucking lovely. I updated my Samsung Pay app today (been a beta tester) and now it says I need to update my system software (via ATT), but there's not ATT update ... soooo ... no Samsung Pay for me after being a beta tester for the past three weeks. Now everybody else has it and I don't. Cool.When will ATT push the update? probably never.
Ditch AT&ampT, I went to Sprint, bill cut in half, paid off all my families phones, everyone got brand new phones.  WIN WIN WIN
You will probably have to use something like Kik or whatsapp. Problem on android that unlike apple where everyone will have iMessage, on android there is no one unified messenger (outside of text with no video or attachment limitations) that everyone uses. 
I can assume there is something wrong but I guess my problem here is if I could suggest a fix it would be hard without even knowing how much it has affected your battery. I will say on t-mobile if I don't use my phone cellstandby is always high. 
This is apples to oranges. Videos sent via iMessage aren't mms.  Mms has 1.2mb limit.  Sending a video on iMessage is like sending a video via kik
I haven't yet. I moved to the note 5 from a nexus 5 that I had rooted and flashed a bunch of roms, so I thought I would want to do the same here, but the note, with Nova launcher, material theme and a cool icon theme is really beautiful, inside and out! 
Sync is on. I did disable some apps using Package Disabler Pro but I enabled everything back already and still same issue.
I experience delay on mobile and wifi. My IPv6 is enable but the test above says IPv6 sites are timing out.
Yes they are. I purchased 2 Aukey chargers from Amazon. One outlet charger and a car charger. Both work great and fast charge 
Ah, ok. I only asked because there's an issue that can cause push messages to be delayed when you're connected to IPv6 enabled WiFi networks due to the wireless radio sleeping. If it's happening with both mobile and WiFi it's possible the issue is something else entirely.
I have not seen a charger/car cradle combo that is what you would consider cheap ever really. If you are looking for any qi charger. Than go buy a 15 dollar charger, a 1dollar usb car adapter and some 3m tape. But Car Cradles with power are expensive period.
Anything ***BUT*** actual samsung wireless chargers. I purchased mine and only charges 5% of it then i have to lift it up and place it again. Apparently this is a known issue to all sam wireless chargers and Samsung is looking for a fix.
Try sharing a picture, and then thinking that you want to just type in a number to send it to that isn't in your contact. Then try to click on a link from a text message.Then cry.... :(
Probably no} Samsung Pay as well. 
So there may be hope that they fix it with an update, then? Thanks for the response! :)
The app will give you a glossary of what is safe to disable. I cant really give you insight cause you might want to keep certain apps enabled as compared to me.
Do you have amazon prime?  If you do you can use Amazons music app and download music for free. Or sign up for Google music. You get ad Free youtube also. I can't think of anyway to be 100% safe without paying.  Sure there are torrents and off the wall sites but then the titles are all wierd and sometimes you get low quality junk. 
I'm not sure that unlocked ones get updates much faster than carrier variants, it just means that you're subject only to Samsung's release schedule and not both Samsung and the carrier, and you have the possibility of flashing third party roms. I mean just look at at 6.0, it's been out for Nexus since October, yet here we are, almost February and no 6.update. So lets be real, if you care about updates then don't buy a Samsung phone.As for buying an unlocked Samsung phone in the states, just Amazon or eBay is fine. Either company will take care of you (Amazon moreso than eBay) if the item isn't as described, and if they fail, then your credit card company will. Don't expect a warranty, Samsung USA is known to deny warranty for unlocked variants.I would avoid the listing you linked though, it doesn't specify the particular variant. You need to check what bands you need and check which variants have them.
I guess I meant back camera. I spoke wrong. 
I cant find cortana anywhere in the app store.... i signed up to be a tester and when i click the link the google play store says that its not found
Can you tether natively without rooting or adding it to your phone bill with the international phone?  And are there any differences to the wireless speeds because of different bands being supported/not supported on the international one vs at&ampt?
Download Galaxy Button Lights from the play store and then set it to Always Off
I dont think it is proprietary I think its just the updated Qi standard. 3rd parties fast chargers are just starting to come out. http://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Charger-Qualcomm-Adapter-Qi-Enabled/dp/B015351V9U/ref=sr_1_2?s=wireless&ampie=UTF8&ampqid=1442279417&ampsr=1-2&ampkeywords=fast+qi+wireless+charger&amprefinements=p_36%3A2491157011
Well they made the GearVR with Samsung for the Note 4 so there is a possibility they'll make one for the Note 5.  No one knows for sure yet though.   I'm hopeful for something awesome.
&gtAnti privacySo nothing on your screen then?
More like it mirrors the screen to any visible electronic display.Browsing /gonewild on your phone?  Now the whole office and see your phone mirrored on their monitors...
I know I thought it sounded really weird too. That was how each company labeled their protecter.
It's definitely personal preference but we are planning to get the tempered screen protectors aswell
Cloud storage?  Maybe a thumb drive to use with your phone?
Try clearing the data and cache from gallery.  Even maybe clear all cache on the phone
What else would you recommend to get the most out of my battery? I only use necessary features like WiFi and data and have disabled about 13apps.
I was complaining that the battery life was still shit. Then I realized I had 6.5 Hrs of SOT with 12.6 hours total. It's not phenomenal, but I got a wireless 5000mAh battery that's smaller than the phone itself. So meh. It's worth it.  
You can use any launcher. A little tab will always be on the home screen of your launcher, as well as the lock screen. You swipe that up to access your cards and then authenticate to use SP. You can also access the cards by swiping up while the screen is off (although there is usually lag with this).
It's not in dialer settings, it's in the main settings menu
When I go to advanced calling it doesn't even look like it's activated. So could it be that which is draining my battery? 
Yeah the magnet is going to be on the car side, not the phone.
I'm having the same issue on Verizon. I've disabled everything and I still see activity on lte when on my WiFi. 
Bought mine on Amazon (in the US).  It said it would be shipped sometime between October and November.   Got an email yesterday saying they shipped it and it's arriving Tuesday.  I bought my Note 5 from Best Buy and they were offering a free wireless Samsung charger.   But it never worked with my Note 5.  So gave it to my wife,  bought a wireless charger receiver for $1on Amazon,  put it in her S5 and now it works perfect. 
He sideloaded the new 5.3.19.19 arm Google app which controls the Google now launcher. I did it and it works great. Sideload the Google launcher 1.2 large m preview after updating/sideliading the Google app 5.3.19. Click allow unkown sources in settings and security and then download both from apkmirror then your all set. They probably won't release a new update until next week or when they have the Sept 29 announcement
Is this on the stock firmware? Can you check what kernel is loaded? The only time I've heard of this happening is when there's a custom kernel.
Who exactly can use Samsung pay? They don't accept chase, fifth third, capital one, or google wallet cards? Is there one and only one bank accepted by Samsung?
If you insert the S-Pen backwards, you can get it out without damaging it or the sensors using a straw. (There are a ton of YouTube videos on the subject now just search Note 5 S-Pen removal or the like.)As for losing it, there's a setting you can activate (or it might be on by default, I don't actually remember) to sound an alert/alarm if the phone and S-Pen get separated. Unless you're in a loud setting, you should be able to hear it.As for the click-y bit getting broken, that I've no remedy for. I use my S-Pen a lot (10-2times a day) and haven't had an issue, and that's with my habit of clicking it absentmindedly like one would a pen.YMMV, of course, but if you like doodling and the S-Pen sounds useful, I'd definitely go with the Note 5. (Or the 4, if you'd like to avoid the S-Pen backwards issue entirely. I believe there are no-root methods to get an Screen-Off Notes function working.)
If you can obtain your MSL,  you can change some apn settings and enable the built in tethering.  You can find more info in the XDA-Developers Note 5 forum. 
I took the advice of /u/corbygray528 and tried holding the device sidways relative to the strip reader ... um, so the back of the device is perpendicular to the slot but still in portrait orientation relative to my body (jesus this is hard to describe) ... headphone jack facing my body, volume buttons facing the ceiling (that's better I think)I only have tried that orientation once, but it did work, so for now I'm going with that. I really expect something like 90% functionality for me to continue using the app. If there's more than a one in ten chance that I'm gonna look stupid AND have to take extra time to whip out the physical card anyway, it's just not worth it for me.
What features exactly do international ebay note 5s not have? I ordered a silver 64gb one 
I am on a custom rom now but if I recall correctly I was sitting at about 8gb on T-mobile
Yeah I figured as much. I have a slick wraps skin on mine right now but just posting a picture with no info is pretty low effort and doesn't help anyone else wanting the same thing. 
Sorry, did it on my phone, meant to add more and got distracted like a dumb person. It's a dbrand skin, leather on the back and mahogany on the front/camera.
I wish I could show the screen, I will have to take a picture and post it. Literally looks like I swiped on the screen, maybe on the side of s pen, and it scratched. 
What games?
material dark with muzei hd space live wallpaper.
I switched from an iphone 6 plus and haven't considered going back.- this phone is a performance beast.  not that the iphone 6 plus is a slouch, but I really notice the extra ram and CPU speed on games and multitasking.- the s-pen isn't nearly as gimmicky as I thought it would be.  I find myself using it both as an interface device and as a pen.- the camera is FAR superior to the iphone 6 plus, and that's saying something.  By far the best smartphone camera I've ever used.- It's far more versatile with my pebble time than IOS is (thank you android wear for providing actionable notifications, I wonder if that works on ios now that android wear works on ios)- built in wireless charging/fast charging?  yes please.  Not that I need to charge in the middle of the day, but being able to go to a full charge in 9minutes is pretty sweet.  Being able to just place the phone on the charging pad and not having to worry about it is pretty awesome too.- reddit sync is easily the best reddit app I've used on a smartphone or a tablet.  I do miss tweetbot though...

Mine charges great on a cheap Itian charger that I got on Amazon.
Going to check them out thanks. Does it provide at least a bit of protection from shattering the back glass?
I wish I had gone with the matte Skinomi now. I went with the regular one and it looks like an orange peel.The flip wallet is interesting. How easy is it to pop in and out? And can you use it easily when you have it flipped open? I mostly use this phone one-handed and worry that would get in the way.
Official samsung extended battery with qi. No idea how many mAH it is but it looks kinda cool.https://youtu.be/Tzv0XTYPAvU?t=2m5s
It seems like a typical polyurethane skin to me. Other brands are probably comparable, but this one was decently priced and matte rather than glossy. 
The phone is held in the flip wallet be the corners only, so it's quite easy to insert and remove. That said, it's not exactly hard to use one handed, but it's not as  easy as being caseless. If you're right handed the flap will hang off the left side out of the way, but left handed users will need to have the flap folded over behind the phone where it adds a considerable amount to the phone's thickness. 
Are you signed up for Google wallet or android pay? You have to have some sort of lock if you do. 
I have an LG-made puck that charges so coolly I cannot feel anything on the back of the phone, but I suppose I can't tell you if the Note 5 is responsible for that as neither the Nexus 5 nor 7 I used on it previously ever warmed either.
Yeah I've used it and love it but being in US everyone doesn't have NFC terminals and if they do many are not even turned on etc. 
Cell standby is probably VoLTE, which is currently an issue with galaxy devices where it drains the battery. For my s6 it is Settings --&gt Connections --&gt Mobile Networks --&gt Mobile Data --&gt Enhanced 4G LTE services
Yeah that's my thoughts too.. Not fun plugging it in 1times to get the fast charging when you're in a hurry and low... Think I should go to t-mobile store?  Feel like they don't really have people on staff for much tech stuff... 
What items though? I don't understand what apps/contact I can use this with
As the manual says, you can drag and drop items from one app to another. Items is a general term since this can vary based on the app and what it supports.As an example, you can drag a photo from the gallery to a text message to attach it.
Good question, I'd try Customer Care first and ask. Not sure if they can do that kind of exchange in store.
Ah got it. Dragged something from my gallery into a text. Thanks!
I am right there with you, I do the same thing with my widgets I have with every samsung I have owned. I feel your pain also 
Umm correct me if I am wrong but 001 is the country code for the US and 646 is the area code for Manhatten. So he might be Nigerian but he lives in Manhatten. Not Nigeria.
Yep, Samsung dropped MHL support for the Note 5...It's the only thing I don't like about the 5... Samsung removed many tiny features that not many people used, but that are nice to have, like MHL support, IR Blaster, UV sensor, **glove mode** OH GOD WHY DID THEY REMOVE IT
These phones are crazy and inconsistent. My battery sucks and I've gone everything 
Nope. Just a folder that I've changed the icon for so it doesn't show like a big pile of icons.
Thinking about getting a skin, never had one before. How easy are they to install? If I have a clear case on over it, does that cause problems?
Not super bulky, I don't really notice it. Drop my phone all the time and it saves the day. Cut outs are perfectly placed, but the spen is a tad recessed so gotta dig for it. Once it pops up its easy to get out though. Wireless charging works through the case just need to place it right.
Not true if it says fast charging then your charger is fast charge capable 
dislike: Touchwiz (still bulky and ugly), home buton/hardware buttons, glass back (WHY???), and bloatware &amp untimely (or non-existant) updates to the OS.like: SPen, Amoled screen (recent thing I started to like), cameras, hardware button placement (I prefer the back button on the right), and the screen size.
the camera has really blown me away. It's been the biggest surprise.
Innovator edition. More of a development prototype aimed at enthusiasts willing to pay the premium for the first chance at oculus VR. This one comes a year later aimed to be a consumer product, with significant improvements and some cost cutting features. Getting the price down to 10was a huge selling point for them.
I have an Otterbox commuter case with two Popsockets attached to the back (yeah, doesn't look too great) and I haven't had any issues using Samsung Pay. I use it pretty much every day.
When I try to resubmit it they say there's a submission under this address, and it's just stuck in pending. I'm sure it's fine, just concerned that it's been quite a while by now for no news. I'll call them tonight or tomorrow if there still is no update :) 
Are you rooted? IF you are you can either manually remove the sound or use xposed to disable.
What I find infuriating is when the fingerprint reader fail 7-8 times in a row and the phone requires the backup password even if I put the phone to sleep and want to try again. 
It doesn't help that the camera is flipping awesome! Super happy with this upgrade :)
Interesting. I don't use prediction, and the most part don't even look at my screen when typing other than to make sure I didn't fuck up.
I include all around. I could be wrong, but I think it's the whole edge of the glass.. I put an otterbox defender on mine now and I don't even see anything of it. Kinda nice lol.
Snapchat.
I don't think we've been asked for a non-pressure responsive pen before! ArtRage is designed to mimic real world tools, so it doesn't always have exactly the same things as other drawing apps.I know you've found some of these things already, but I'm going to point everything out anyway in case other people are having trouble. Disclaimer: I handle the tech support, so my automatic response to questions is to regurgitate the manual :D*Firstly there is no pen. The thing that looks like a pen still has pressure sensitive width*There are two pens in the app: the Ink Pen (black and green, silver tip) and the Felt Pen (white, green tip). The Pencil is also useful for some 'pen' like things.* The Ink Pen size is pressure responsive, and it comes with smoothing and taper options. * The Felt Pen size is NOT pressure responsive if you set Softness to 0% (because the pen doesn't 'spread out'). Set Wetness to 100% and turn on Art Pen for a solid line (tip: if you turn Art Pen off, Pressure &amp Wetness 100%Softness 50%, you get a Copic Marker like pen). You'll always get a wet fuzzy edge, though it's not visible at small sizes.* The Pencil (with 'Precise' turned on) also creates a fixed width and has a smoothing option. Precise is the equivalent of a mechanical pencil, so pressure only changes the darkness of the stroke.*The brush settings aren't all that clear, I somehow ended up with a chisel brush pen and couldn't change it.*The Settings have a Presets menu next to them (the folder icon). These are saved combinations of settings to help you choose different kinds of pen/brush/whatever while you're still figuring out the options. You can also create new ones. If you have a look in there, you can try out different tools.The settings themselves are based on real world properties. In this case, the 'chisel' effect was probably caused by a low Aspect (aspect means the ratio of width:length, so a high aspect means a 1:1 ratio, or a completely square/round tip). You can also switch 'Square Head' on and off and adjust the Rotation (angle) of the pen.*Layer blending only has one global settings, blending needs to be adjusted per layer. Also there is no lock transparency or other advanced layer settings, or even transparency.*A global setting for all layers isn't something we've ever considered, I think. I'll pass it on and see if it's possible (edit: I know, that's not what you were asking! I'm still going to pass it on though and watch the programmer twitch). Currently, it's designed to be consistent across our different apps and desktop editions.(tip: the Watercolor blend mode is unique to ArtRage, it's useful for layering Watercolors).Lock transparency is in the desktop program and was recently added to the iPad app, so it may make it into the Android app in future (we try and keep the apps consistent, but the iPad app is about 4 years ahead in development time).Transparency can be adjusted by dragging or tapping on the black circle next to the layer preview, in the layers menu. The eye symbol will hide/show a layer (and prevent you drawing on it when hidden).Other layer options (e.g. merge, duplicate, import, delete, canvas settings) can be found by tapping the little menu icon in the layers menu. *The UI was alright, but no power user important features, like quick selectable dropper tool, quick brush size adjustment, or volume button undo. Also no canvas rotation.*Aside from the tap and hold colour picker that you found already in the settings, the silver tool in the top right of the tools is a Color Sampler. You can also create and save sets of colours (the folder on the far right of the menu bar) and pick colours directly from a Reference image without needing a tool/setting (these can be very handy for quickly importing a palette), or from a tracing image overlaid on the actual painting (the two options just to the left of the Color Samples folder in the menu bar).Brush size can be adjusted by:* tapping and typing on the size in the top menu bar* tapping and dragging right or left on the size text in the menu bar (my preferred method)* using the size sliders in the tools or settings menus* three finger drag up and down (three finger left/right will undo/redo).We're considering whether we can add the volume button as an undo feature, I think it's on the 'look into this and see what it involves' list. We're also currently working on a proper Transform feature.Canvas rotation is... argh, one that comes up a lot. It's quite a memory intensive process, and ArtRage can be a pretty demanding app, so we left it out to avoid people running out of memory and crashing the app mid-turn. We've just added it to the iPad app (... well, in the very next update), but only because iPads have recently gotten a lot more powerful, and big enough that they can't be physically rotated easily, and it's an optional feature.We do have the option to 'lock interface rotation' in the settings, so you can lock everything in place and turn the actual device.---... mostly, we have to figure out how much stuff from the original desktop version will actually fit into an app, without overwhelming people's phones!
Got mine, went to bb and bought a gear s2 :)
I took mine out and put it in a different case.  It fell out of my pocket from 2.5 feet and cracked my screen protector.  I still haven't changed it out, but I put it back in the case I took it out of.  I got lucky it was just my tempered glass protector and not my screen.
Download package disabler pro from the app store and you can uninstall any of the bloatware without root
Turn off the stuff you are not using.  GPS, Bluetooth, screen rotation, etc.  Best I've done before charging for the night is 39% left after 14 and 1/2 hours.Now when I use my phone at work for music via bluetooth, the time is much less.  
I've flashed Darthstalker, Dr. Ketan, and Venom. I like Venom the most. The only thing I don't like is that I can't find where to disable volte and wifi calling. I liked Darthstalker, too, but I kept getting this problem where fast charging stops working and my PC wouldn't recognize the phone. I read somewhere that it had to do with VR Gear (I'm not tech savvy enough to understand why). But even uninstalling VR Gear, it still randomly happens. I can't figure out if it's the ROM, or the firmware I'm using. Anyhow, I digress. 
Interesting. The speed mined going at it probably won't get mine till the new year.
I think that's just an issue with the Noble Kernel used to root the phone. Once I switched off that to something less shit, the reboots stopped.I can't speak for the Gear VR stuff because I don't have one. I want it though. Amazon pls restock soon.
Battery life.
I still haven't gotten my promo code, and that promo is no longer available on the website to check the status anymore, and the prizelogic number mailbox is full to request an update! :(
Here's the screen protector I use and recommend. It's very thin, very cheap, and works super well with the S-Pen. Even better than the screen itself, in my opinion. https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00U5Y63JS/ref=yo_ii_img?ie=UTF8&amppsc=1
It's a Tech21 Invisible Shield. Claims to be self healing, but I take that claim with a pinch of salt. Still, no scratches from the S Pen, which also glides pretty smoothly across it. It feels a bit more grippy against the nib, but nothing that bothers me. 
What carrier do you have? I'm on Verizon and Cell standby is just killing my battery. 
Exactly, which is why I stick to stock rom and a few xposed mods 
Are you using Package Disabler?  Funny thing about disabling system apps.  Some apps are just expected to be there because they are uninstallable, and some services will just not be prepared how to deal with the fact.  So when it's not there, and there is an unhandled exception, the app will just crash, or get stuck in a loop and to get an answer from the disabled service until it receives a response.If you disabled a lot of stuff using package disabler, try re-enabling all the disabled packages.  If the problem goes away, use the process of elimination to find out which one you should leave enabled.Similar thing happened to me when I got an update.  I updated after I disabled some system apps.  And every time I would boot, it would run the updating apps 1 of 1 dialog box.  It wasn't until I re-enabled the app and rebooted, the updating apps completed successfully.  After it completed successfully, I re-disabled the app, and after a reboot, the dialog box wouldn't appear.
Spigen Slim Armor, like the kickstand. Doesn't add much bulk but after using clear TPU I noticed it slightly.
All Samsung Note 5's were supposed to ship with free earphones... except Verizon decided instead of doing that, they'd negotiate with Samsung to have those removed. Something about negotiating a lower price, and Samsung benefits by not having to include a free item. Verizon at it's fucking finest.
Ahhhh I didn't know that. There's still a lot you can customize with package disabler and with icon packs and themes though!!
I'm in the exact same situation...  My buddy ordered one and got the email that they were back ordered. It shipped 4 days after he got the backorder notification. That was before the 15 though.... so crossing my fingers..
no it is completely stock. every time i open the samsung pay app it says it needs an update to continue and then takes me to the system screen to check for updates but of course there isn't any. i'm already on 5.1.1....so weird.
i got the phone 2 weeks ago from an att store so i assume its an att sim?
My Note 5 is already lagging. True story. The pull down when running navigation and Google Play Music takes ~3 seconds to come down. The first week it was instant. Also, systemwide micro-lags are real and have arrived. Yes everything under the sun is disabled. Doesn't help.Selling it soon. Order placed for a black 128gig 6P with protection plan.Bye Samsung.
I have and use both an S6 Edge and a Note 5 and I've been pretty pleased with the Note overall. I do enjoy not accidentally touching the screen like I do with the S6, the battery life has been noticably better and havent had one bit of lag. I'd recommend the upgrade
Depending on your phone's security settings, you could have an account or policy that does not permit you to have a phone without a lock method.Check your security settings, reset them if necessary, or it may be something that your company enforces (if this applies to you).
I live in Canada, using Rogers. I think it might have something to do with Samsung KNOX. I can't deactivate it in the device administrators and I think that's what the problem is since KNOX can let me change my lock screen without having the phone on me in case it gets stolen etc.
http://imgur.com/0SCLLIkI personally use timely. This is what the widget looks like. 
Can you turn the alarm on or off from the phone's main screen using the widget, without opening the app? Not sure it's what I'm looking for. 
So after the 28th, I can sign up with them and get reimbursed for my payments on my T-Mobile Note 5 and/or my familys S6 Edge+s? Just making sure I'm understanding this right
It's this one: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B011LXLIEGIt comes with panels for the sides and screen but I only wanted the back panel skin.
can you comment on the call quality and the speakers?  do they sound the same?  I have an s6 non-edge and i was wondering if they are all the same.  My regular s6 have a robotic sound to voices from the speaker and the call quality also is a bit thin.  I am considering going for the Note 5 but wonder if they have these issues.
Are you connected to work email,  or have you encrypted the phone? Either one would require a lock. 
Still no Samsung Pay &gt. &gt Meh.  My screen seems bit more responsive tho
That's cool. I'm currently using the Spigen Neo Hybrid Carbon as a really happy middle ground between the Otterbox and a cheap case. Bit slimmer / lighter but still full on protection. I have this issue now you see - after testing out the Otterbox for a few days every other case I just feel like it's not protecting the phone enough and I'm afraid to leave the house with it !  
Fingerprint requires a password backup. No way around that.
I wish I would have known about this. I bought the wireless charger the day I bought my phone :(
And with 1080p you can get 60fps :D
There's usually an H shaped piece of plastic over the flash. It comes off easily.http://imgur.com/uqTVjLNIf you can't see it then it's not there.
Gonna have to disagree with you there Chief. The deciding factor between buying a Note 5 versus the Nexus 6P shouldn't be which gets updates the fastest. I've been an Android user for five years and six different handsets. No update has ever changed the core experience of any device significantly. While the S Pen is a major selling point of the Note series,  the hardware is what matters. OP should go for the Nexus if they want custom rom options and Note 5 for just about everything else. 
I got an email this morning saying it was still on back order.It was delivered at noon.Got an email at 4:3that it was shipped.At least I got it.
T Mobile here but I've heard it's best to disable VoLTE in your phone app settings. 
Did it happen when you first got the Note 5? I have been using my 36and the note 5 without issues for a week now. First try running in safe mode (removes 3rd party apps)  see what happens. If not worst case try a factory reset and see what happens. 
Yup, same here. I have to replug it a couple of times to activate fast charging. Ended up using a different cable, no issues since.
I've gotten the S-Pen stuck in the phone....the correct way!  I had to bang it on my knee super hard to get it to come out.Otherwise, besides some apps crashing (Pocket, Pandora) it's been a stellar phone.
Hurt? Not much,  but the battery has a finite number of cycles, something like 300-40cycles. A cycle is a full discharge from 10to 0.So if you did that300-40times, your battery would be completely dead. Given you can't easily change this battery yourself, you probably don't want to burn through those cycles unless you absolutely have to. Ideally you want to keep the phone between  40-8percent,  but that's more planning than I want to deal with,  so I just top off when I can and rarely let my phone get under 3or 4percent. 
If using latest roms then no,  you can disable which apps can be killed,  kind of like greenerfyWord is marshmallow will totally fix ram issues. I myself use a custom modded Rom and kernel and don't notice this ram issue. At&ampt and version note 5s are boot locked so no roms for you if you get them models
Google 4K [whateveryou'relookingfor] wallpaper
It's actually two widgets. Google digital clock on the left and the stock weather on the right.
I've got both of these and while I'm typing this on my Note, I like the 6p more. I still dislike touchwiz and there is a bunch more noticeable lag on my Note. Particularly when typing. The finger print reader works better for me on the 6p. The speakers are better too. Both have great displays, build quality, and cameras. 
Yeah, I just got my phone back last night. They replaced all the internals, so far it's working perfectly. No dropped calls or loss of data connectivity yet
Hmm, I'm using the supplied charger with the extender and the supplied Samsung cable plugged into the extender. I'm not getting it. I figured the 10ft of extra cable made it not register. 
I had this issue on mine yesterday when I was at a company retreat all day and off Wifi using Sprint LTE. I had about 55 minutes screen time, but Cell Standby was still higher. I took the phone off the charger at 8am, and when I left the retreat at 43the phone was at 60%. Not terrible, but considering I didn't use it a ton, I would expect that to be higher.
You commented on my thread about redirecting S-Voice using Tasker, and I thought you said this had worked for you?! Makes me feel a little better I guess, knowing I'm not alone.The Note 4 was a special case. If you look at some of Google's help pages regarding Ok, Google functionality, it refers to the Moto X lineup and specifically the Note 4 when mentioning always-listening/screen off capabilities. It's a real shame Samsung didn't keep that going with all the newer Samsung phones.
Sync uses data, which uses battery.
What carrier? Is it an international version?
I just got mine! Kind of a shock budgeted after I got the charger, I got declined for the $10check. Weird
The case I have is called the Spigen Rugged Capsule. As for tempered glass, the brand I bought is called iCarez and I love it so far. They don't make fitted tempered glass for the Note 5 specifically, however. The one I am using is for generic 5.7 phones. Still love it though! 
The Note 4 has this too. I'm thinking it has to do with the camera. 
It's been amazing for me. Got it over the 6P so I can't comment on the 6P but I don't have any regrets. Camera is amazing, battery life as well (6h15min+ every day, sometimes over 2). Phone is snappy as well, no frame drops, doesn't overheat. I don't game much so I can't say anything about that but I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone looking for a large screen phone. If you have any questions I would be more than happy to try and answer them.
Every note, and every android device I have has used a different charger at some point in time. I charge my Note 5 everyday at work using an LG Charger. I haven't had one issue. The want you to think you should only use the oem one so you will come running back to them if you ever need a new one.  Don't take cellular advice from a cell phone store salesmen 
I was going to post this the other day. In the US you get $20of merchandise plus other services. In Canada you get 6 months of google play music...($60). I called Bell and Samsung and both of them said thats just how it is basically. 
How are they not forward compatible? They should work it's just the accuracy is off. The only reason I'm wondering how they are not forward compatible is because I can use my Wacom digitizer from my old TC 110on my note 5 and my note 10.1 2014. Yes its very accurate but that is just because of the distance that the receiver is from the screen.
I have the Otterbein commuter case on mine, and I love it, granted I have bigger hands but I still find it very manageable, even better then the Droid turbo I had, my wife has a commuter case as well and has small hands and she manages it fine as well. hope this helps
Using something like an Otterbox I think tip the Note 5 into the too big category and undermine the fine work Samsung did designing the phone. But I've used the official Samsung case and the Ringke slim and neither added much bulkiness or made the phone unmanageable. They don't offer much in the way of drop protection, though. Coming from an iPhone 5, your biggest hurdle will be the size without a case! (Although it's one of the best big phones I've ever used) 
i have an otterbox defender on mine and it charges like a champ with the samsung fast wireless charger
When you are in the S Health app home screen, tap your name in the top left corner. It will pop out the info screen and it has an edit button. Its all set there. It may require you to have a Samsung account.
Yes it will, though I know there is some rumbling about band 12 of lte on T-Mobile, I haven't been too concerned with it, but it could affect you slightly.
Before my Samsung wireless charger couldn't hold a charging state for more than a few moments.  After the update, it's vastly more reliable.  Like, exactly how I expected it to work upon purchase.
How do you know if you have gear vr services? 
I had an original Samsung wireless charger, first week  or so worked fine then blue light flash... Which meant it stopped charging. Finally replaced it with Samsung wireless fast charger, never had the issue again. I think others on the net have complained about this issue also. If it's under warranty I would exercise the option to get them the device Pronto. 
There is a few things you can do:1. You can install a new launcher, Nova for example is a really popular launcher that can give your phone a stock Android with a few more options for customization but if you want more customization GO launcher may be for you.2. Themes in the theme store are actually pretty nice if you can right the one right for you. It changes pretty much the whole UI including apps, Samsung keyboard and wallpaper.3. Icon packs, though icon packs are mostly compatible with different launchers, there is certain applications that allow you to change the look of TouchWiz icons and you can partner that with a theme from the theme store.TouchWiz is really hard to avoid if you want the S pen technology and features but I hope this helped you a bit.
Note 1 was an amazing phone at the time, head and shoulders above anything else. Then I would say Note 3. Note 4 was a marginal improvement year, it could have been the best, but it suffered from quality issues and stuttering. Note 5 is not as big of an improvement than it could have been, there are a lot of competing equally as good phones. I would say for travel Note 4 (if you get a good one) still beats out the Note 5 because of the swappable batteryI upgrade every iteration and Note 1 followed by the Note 3 were the ones that made me feel giddy to use the phone every time i held them in my hands. 
i hate to say this, but honestly the only way i can think to get it out is to drop it. usually if i drop it hard enough the pen pops out.
How did you go about getting rid of all the bloatware? What battery tips can you give me. Thanks
Have you tried using the Call Forwarding codes? I had to do this for US Cellular because the webpage method failed.For Sprint it looks like you'd hit *28, then your 1Digit GV#, later you can dial *38 to cancel it.
Either that or the lock timeout is at as something like 5 minutes, mine was that from stockEdit : go to settings -  lockscreen and security - secure lock settings - lock instantly with power key. Also set lock automatically to the lowest setting
Get **Android File Transfer** to make transferring files between the two possible. It's an app made by Google itself to allow that.https://www.android.com/filetransfer/You can get **Pushbullet** to get your notifications from your phone onto your Mac desktop, as well as sending links and photos/documents. It also allows your to reply to SMS, but only 10a month with the new update (the update removed a lot of great features to put them behind a $40/year paywall).https://www.pushbullet.com/**MightyText** also lets you reply to SMS, this time it's 50SMS a month for free.https://mightytext.net/**Unified Remote** is also great, it allows you to control you Mac using remotes on your phone, like commands for YouTube, Netflix, iTunes, Spotify, Chrome, etc. It's a really nice app.https://www.unifiedremote.com/I'm getting my Note 5 on Thursday so if I find anything new I'll tell you.
Question... While everything appears to be fine,  I did an OTA update last week and completely forgot to roll back all the things I disabled with PD.  Maybe it's OK because I mainly disable all the Verizon stuff and leave most,  if not all,  the Samsung stuff alone?  This question was brought to us by paranoia. 
I have no idea but it worked for me. University WiFi speed is 965 Mbps on my PC, 2.3 Mbps on my Note 5 on the day of arrival, and 100+ Mbps on my friends' iOS devices. Accidentally turned it off and my speed soared. Turn it back on and my speeds drop again. I posted this same solution weeks ago in another similar thread and it worked for that OP.https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxynote5/comments/3lmw0k/slow_wifi/
I honestly normally get over 4 hours of screen on time with about 20% plus battery left. So far I'm very happy with this phone. 
Yep, Verizon and AT&ampT versions are fucked.  That being said, I never bothered with Samsung Pay (I refuse to use BoA, there's no US Bank by me, etc) so I tossed on a custom rom, used RootCloak on Android Pay, and everything is working fine here. I just miss out on stripe-only machines.  Who cares?
This is what I'm thinking.  I have tried the charger provided with the Note5 and an S6, same problem with both, but the S6 always says Fast Charging, with both cables.  This seems to point to a faulty phone.
turning on power save and then ultra power save if things get tight else wait for marshmellow update ?: )
Mine worked at Target before (surprised the hell out of the pharmacist), but didn't work at all last time I was there. It did the usual pulse thing, but the terminal just showed an error and I ended up using a card like normal. I think this was even before the last update, though, so I don't think it was related. I haven't had a chance to try again since then. 
Yes I noticed it too, when you type a first name and automatically have it fill in an email. You can always change it back from the suggestion bar just above the keyboard but I agree it's annoying.
Is there a way to show entire notes using the widget that I'm unaware of? 
you're living life on the edge!! 
I had a minor issue with trying to get the phone in the right place to charge till I put it down sideways. Grabs a charge every time now with the phone in an otterbox case. Leave it in the case and give the phone a 9degree turn and see if that does the trick.
It's the nicest one in my opinion I was between the 6 edge plus but it doesn't come in white so I got this, glad I did 
I have chase, I just opened a bank of america account, and am using that with samsung pay until chase takes over. This also got me the free charge pad
I've had the same problem with my Note 5. The included fast charging cable doesn't charge fast at all. In fact, it takes all night to charge. My third party fast charging car charger charges really fast.  
I'm using Mime. Expensive, but it feels great, and while there actually is a halo, it's absolutely miniscule, barely noticeable and still retains great coverage. Mind you, I opted for the thinner model.I'm waiting for Phantom Glass to make one though, it'd be my first Phantom. They did tell me they're working on it on Twitter.
Thanks for this tip. Albeit it is merely a work around to what i believe is a software bug.
Just tried, same here. Can only uninstall updates if you try to do it from the app store. 
I agree. Unless you enjoy looking at trapped air bubbles on your screen, I'd avoid a screen protector. Gorilla Glass is designed to withstand scratches so you should be fine as long as you're not too clumsy. A case though is highly recommended. It's a very slippery phone to hold. 
Plus it doesnt block the pen
I haven't seen the problem of too many messages happen with any type of instant messaging like hangouts, but only the regular text and MMS messages (which I know you can also use with hangouts). Umm.. Try this! Try getting an app like Handcent to see how many actual text messages are on the phone. It should have a number next to each conversation thread, and this will give you an idea. (You don't have to actually keep Handcent, can uninstall afterwards). I've noticed on my Note 5 after around 7-8k messages, it starts to get a bit slow. Hope that helps!
I bought the same kind of mount and the wireless charging didn't work because of the metal plate.  But with a bumper case (and exposed back) the phone stays on the mount without a metal plate.  A best buy employee told me that any kind of magnetic mount will break the wireless charging eventually,  but I could not find info to verify or disprove 
I switch back-and-forth lately I've just been using the stock browser.
I'm saying from the lock screen.   I use nova launcher prime
Nice. I spent $6on games for it already ???I bought a 250gb EVO SSD using the promo code for myself. I picked up a GearVR from AT&ampT last week.
other subs hate me for ruining their discussion-based threads w/ dank memes, but DAE feel the same? I guess I ought to embellish...I haven't used a stylus since my Palm Treo. When it was time to upgrade I was considering stepping up to the Note series for the increased screen size and assumed I would largely disregard the stylus. I couldn't have been more wrong! Amazing tracking, minimal parallax, etc. Now I'm sketching things left &amp right, making precise photoshop edits, all sorts of stuff! Just wanted to share my enthusiasm :)
Question, when you get icon packs, do you have to manually pair the icons with the right app? 
You can sign up for multiple promotions if they're for different things, e.g. the Holiday Bundle for buying the phone and the credit for activating Samsung Pay.At least, that's my understanding.
I had this same problem. Bought the N5 on Sunday. I was using Google messenger. I deleted all the texts, switched to stock messenger and deleted 2 draft texts. Reset apns, rebooted and now I have mms in Stock messenger again. 
I did try to install the drivers from samsung.com on my PC to make sure I had them. When that didn't work I tried using Kies to install them. My wifes phone is a s6edge+ and her is able to connect.Is download mode the same as going into developer options and turning on USB debugging?Edit: Also should I try Mobile Odin Pro? 
So that doesn't come with the cable?  I need 2 cables as well.  I heard the cable is just as important as the charger itself getting fast charging to work?
I like how none of these posts about great battery life come from Verizon users. Meanwhile I'm sitting here clicking the check for update button
I feel it's also due to the proximity of the scanner/button to the bottom of the phone. I have two cases, one from best buy, don't even know the brand, which is nothing more than a thin silicone sleeve, the other is from Urban Armor Gear, I use for work and anytime I feel the device could be subjected to drops or damage otherwise.  The thicker rubber around the phone from the UAG case (and others available on the market) and the fact the scanner/button is so very close the the bottom of the phone due to the crazy thin bezels around the screen seem to cause more missed scans. I think it caused me to shift my finger slightly off and/or not cover the entire button. I initially set up my fingerprint with the slimmer case on the phone. After I retrained with the slightly bulkier case, I get way fewer missed scans. And as others said, shift your finger around when training a new print, more tolerance for being off center.
Two other things I can think of: maybe there's a background app doing a red tint overlay, or could be a defective display. 
no only NFC, but thats better than pretty much any other AW watch. 
My five:1. Install the Dark Material Theme2. Install Buzz Launcher (it takes a while to learn how to use it, but it's the best looking, and most customization launcher if that's your thing).3. Buy 'Note Buddy' and change your S Pen removal/insertion noise to Light Saber On/Off (search for that on Zedge)4. Buy an official Samsung flip case, either the one with the window, or the one with the card slot5. buy a QI charger pad
Verus High-Pro Shield. Excellent case and good protection.
worked fine with my wireless chargers that I have
It doesn't. The agreement showed in my phone when I installed. I verified the knox counter using this [this method](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/110159/how-to-see-if-knox-is-tripped-on-samsung-s6-edge)
No problem glad you got it taken care of. I'm sure you'll figure out how to manage your battery. 
Make sure you follow all the steps i mentioned earlier , specially the Google ones. turn the auto brightness off and keep your screen somewhere between 35% to 50%.
Nope. The pen itself is round, rotating it doesn't affect how the phone detects the pen. There's a line thickness difference between down strokes and up strokes though. Try it!
Yeah I know it isn't cheap. I was hoping maybe for the price they'd have some protection. Thank you the reply!
Just a thought. This seems rather simple, but there is a function of the tablet that can ignore the fingers while the s pen is nearby. If you tried to touch it with your finger while holding the s pen in the same hand, it would not work with this setting in place.From [here](https://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/127695/Why+does+my+tablet+respond+to+S-Pen+but+not+my+fingers). Not sure if the same problem has carried over or somehow gotten turned on you Note 5, but it may be that simple.
Contact zagg.  Chances are they'll replace it for free since it's a defect. Most of the time they'll ask for pictures and send you a new one at no charge.
I'm in the same boat. No system update. I did sideload the framework last week.
Mine just started acting up after almost 2 weeks. Occasionally gets stuck and definitely not the same feedback as the volume buttons. 
The camera looks like it has gaps around it.. Or is that just shiny black plastic making it look like nothing is there?
[Smart Manager](http://imgur.com/5wWknmF) is also what I use. It comes pre-installed with the Note 5. It also has its own widget which is really useful. 
So far so good, I'm a student so it definitely keeps up with my needs. The battery life is insane (~16-17 hrs avg from full charge) and I'm coming from an S3 that killed 2 batteries in the span of 6-7 hrs each. The big screen helps when I read my notes on the go. I actually end up using the S-Pen a lot more than I thought I would. SD card I'm willing to let it slide now because of a lot of cloud storage but I don't stream my music so we'll have to see where 32 GB takes me in the long run (Only 32 gb in Canada :( ). But yeah there might be a few losses, but look past them and you got a great phone that probably suits your profession. Don't let bias opinions of others be the main decision maker for you.
Didn't think about it until just now but it seems weird that the calculator can be a floating app but not a splitscreen app
That sucks man. I feel like you can design the phone to make it premium while making it durable as well. The glass back just isn't practical.
Its in stock Android but removed from touchwiz.  You could look at 3rd party lockscreens but I don't know which do what anymore.

Hey this might seem random but do you use that orange suction cup thing on your car too?
This is the one I went with but I dunno about water protective.http://urbanarmorgear.com/collections/samsung-note-5-cases
Make sure smart network switch is turned off. 
thanks!! I'll hit up Best Buy in a day or two if I don't get an update
So you're using a little dongle now? Hmm I don't really have an answer except a cloud player like CloudPlayer by DoubleTwist or Google Play Music once you upload your music to Google. I know it's not a solution for everyone since it uses data. 
You can just get some 2mm tape on amazon to put around the edges.  Op probably hadnt put the adhesive on yet when he took the pic. 
Yup, ordered mine about the same time.  Gave up hope, and just bought a Cheotek Fast Wireless charger. Should of just ordered the Case.
I think the display and camera are the nicest I've ever used and I would probably give them both a 1but honestly, a 9 is not bad.
Oyps. Sorry, I thought you were talking about in s notes.  Changing the type of instrument (caligrapgy point, pencil, etc.) changes the writing style. But that's not what you asked, sorry. I don't even know where the handwriting recognition thing is. 
Even with no security and only swipe I can??t bypass the swiping action with the notifications. I have to tap a notification, then swipe so it opens to that notification. I think that is just how it performs.
I want Note 5 and gear vr, but I'd like type c. Hmmm
3-4 hours total battery life? I think there's something very wrong with that man, I'm charging once a day, using it quite frequently and it'll still have ~30-40% by the time I get home.
word of warning that none of these PDP evangeslists are telling youA lot, like, a fucking lot of the things you disable in PDP to get high SoT are things like the contact autofill, the shortcuts, the in-call speakerphone toggle, various connectivity functionality resources, some themes, basically all of the neat features that come with the phone like smartstay, smart dial or whatever, basically most gestures like flipping the phone over or using your hand to take a selfie, etc. I'm getting more and more concerned with people finding out how to squeeze 1hrs of SOT with 19 hours of activity and literally everything but youtube and chrome disabled. SOME of us bought the $80phone with the stylus bay to use all of the innumerable sensors and processes. This is not a viable solution for a lot of people. I found myself in the, ugh, what the fuck. situation of having to go back in and enable a service because my amazing battery life set up had disabled like all of the reasons I got a flagship device. I don't want 15 hours of SoT if I can't see my photos because the brightness is below 50%, the alarm shuts off after 1 min because the phone kills it when it sleeps, and I keep using data because it shuts off my wifi when I'm not directly pulling Data. 
Root basically goes like this:  Open Odin and flash your recovery.  Go into the recovery and flash a rooted kernel.  Then flash the custom ROM.  Done.  Took me about 15 minutes.
My Note 5 has a ton of tiny scratches on it from like 2 weeks of not having a screen protector. My S4 however has a few as well but that was from 2 and half years of not having a screen protector.
So I mighta done goofed. I got a spigen liquid crystal, and it's ok. The fit could be a little tighter, but it's nice and slim and light. I don't feel anywhere near as confident in its ability to take a drop as I did with the neo hybrid, but I expected that. I'll probably end up getting a ringke slim or fusion at some point in the future, but for now this will do. 
Came from the G4 and have to return it (Jump on Demand). Turned it back on to return it to stock and... Don't miss it. Loved the camera, performance was mixed, temps were alright, screen was blah. Back buttons didn't add a lot for me either.
I always get black exclusively because there's no distraction or contrast when I watch videos or read at night. A white border that stands out always distracting.
Digitizer is toast.  Time to RMA
Settings -&gt S Pen Settings -&gt Scroll down to see S Pen Power Saver 
Anyone try this with an edge+?
I use Nova Launcher personally and it seems to work well for me. I haven't noticed any lag on my phone. 
It's been a little spotty - but I think the picture showing you how to hold the device isn't the best. Since I've started holding it the right way it's worked 100% (total of 5 attempts now). I just wrote how I hold it in another comment, so I'll paste that below for you:If the card slot flat and on the right (imagine a girl laying in bed on her side, so her ass is pointing to the right, her butt crack is the card slot, and you'd have to swipe your card with the magnetic strip facing the bed and the Visa logo facing the ceiling) - in that situation you should hold the phone so that the power button is facing the floor with the back of the phone centered over the magnetic slot (so the phone would take a well centered picture of the superior half of the girl's ass crack and the picture would include both left and right butt cheeks).
I did. Unfortunately I failed and cracked the back glass. Got a back glass replacement and decided not to mess with it again. 
Ya but that's on Ultra Power Savings mode. I won't be using that mode all the time...
So, the battery *can* be changed then?
Stop assuming that my previous statement is an assumption. Frankly, I am tired of battery life posts. The battery isn't going to get better with this particular model. Why beat a dead horse. If you need more battery for productivity reasons bring a charger to work with you. It isn't the note 4. You don't have an extra battery option. The fast charge works great anyway in in 2mins you can have enough battery to get through a few more hours of SoT. If you are one of the people complaining that they can't stream something for 6 hours (which I know you aren't), get off your phone and do something better with your time.
The Note 5 display blows the Note 4's out of the water. Here's some interesting reading material on that. http://www.displaymate.com/Galaxy_Note5_ShootOut_1.htm And as someone who used to carry 3 extra Note 4 batteries, I'm actually doing just fine with a non-removable battery. Fast Charging is fast as fuck.
Hasn't happened to me. But I got an s pen in a different color on amazon. $3
The only update I've seen about Samsung Pay coming to Verizon is [this tweet](https://twitter.com/wgraylin/status/648896346297004033) from LoopPay CEO Will Graylin. It hasn't been confirmed from either Verizon or Samsung but it's something.

Sending protocols, Google apps, other dependencies like location services, etc.  Check the permissions for Snapchat and see what it depends on.
Thanks! this is encouraging! My father has the S view. I was thinking of the otterbox defender or comm. or the Trident Aegis pro or spigen neo hybrid. Along with the screen protectors I mentioned above!
Use Package Disable Pro to disable bloatware. I increased my battery life a lot. Get it in the Google Play Store. 
I had this problem too and it was driving me freaking batty until a came across a forum post that said turning on Daydream (Settings, Display, Daydream) is a workaround. Sure enough it works. I put it on Photo frame and pointed to a folder that has only one image of a solid black rectangle so that even if the screen wakes, it only shows a black screen.I've been doing this for about 3 days not and it works fine.
As others have said, the software is improved.Although the Note 5's rear cmos sensor is identical to the one the one in the Note 4, the lens has changed. The focal length has become slightly wider (31mm to 28mm equivalent), it has overall better better resolving power, and its aperture has increased by just under 2/3 stops (+0.6EV), from F/2.2 to F/1.9.
That's interesting. I'm pretty sure I'm not touching the screen when this happens but I'll be more mindful going forward. It's funny that the thin bezels, deemed a great thing by most people, are slight annoyances at times for the reason you mention.
That's insane...Has it always done that? May need to factory reset. Are you play settings so apps only update on wifi?Can't think of any legitimate cause for that much usage.
I wonder if I won't be able to participate because I bought the phone at a 25dollar discount from best buy? I signed up for the 10dollar Samsung store credit via Samsung pay. 
Yeah most people have fairly high cell standby use. I'm waiting to see if Marshmallow relieves some of that.
Also check out this spen holder I thing this is what you was talking about in your op. http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-S-Pen-Stylus-Eraser/dp/B009QW3SGQ
I am getting very good battery life.  The issue will be only initially where it drains battery when idle.  Give it some time,  the new battery optimization update which I got recently has made a big difference for me. You can choose to optimize apps for battery consumption through smart manager and it really helps without crippling or disabling any thing
Have you checked if they somehow went into a private album? Turn private mode on in the settings then go to your gallery.

Same as you it all started a few days ago when my phone updated I have not found a fix for it yet either. Phone is 100% stock I have not rooted or done any modifications. I've clear cache, factory reset,  and I even use Samsung smart switch to reinstall the OS. Happens randomly and only a reboot fixes it.
Definitely white. The black one might look good at first but it is a huge finger print magnet. So it will look horrible unless you keep wiping the back. With the white one you wont see the finger prints.
What Samsung promotion?
Back when I was a young kid in the 80s my sister had one of these clear phones in her bedroom. She was 7 years older than me, and spoiled. Anyways, I unplugged her phone, took it outside onto the driveway and I wanted to break it and get out all the cool parts. That fucking phone was invincible.
Haven't had a chance to try hangouts yet, but it doesn't even recognize the existence of play music. Gmail is pretty standard. Archive, reply, delete. Supposedly shows notifications for Google Now but I have yet to see that work. Really, the app support is fairly barebones. 
If you use Google Play Music the playlists you make on your computer will follow you to your phone and vice versa.
Yeah, don't put the pen in backwards.
I am seeing the same issue with my two days old Galaxy Note 5. It does not deliver the push notifications until, swipe to unlock the phone and then i see the push messages arrive that should have been arrived an hour earlier.
If it makes you feel any better,  it's not the fast wireless charger. 
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeBClN2ByT8) you goEdit: a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxynote5/comments/3q81aw/freaking_note_5_camera/) before this one
I definitely use the S-Pen more now since all I've to do is pop it out and start to write. 
The adaptive fast charge cable is the same for both phones. Call Samsung and request an accessory exchange for part number EP-TA20JWEUSTA. If you call, remember that the person you get on the phone by no means makes the rules and hate them just as much as you do. They'll be happy to file your complaints if you are courteous and friendly, and that will go much further.
I went for titanium silver, I think it's the nicest colour. You can what's app mygsm and they reply really quickly. 
If you like the look of the icons without the background just apply the theme and change the background. I did this with the starlit night theme and a star wars background. http://imgur.com/TaG2ay6
Are you guys using any other email client now?This is frustrating, my Moto 36watch also doesnt show the content now because the phone app is not showing notifications, and I have to unlock the phone everytime for every email.
Soooooo, you want to part with the 930?Edit:  By the way, I think the battery life is great.  I make it through 16+ hour days with 4-6 hours of screen time.
General rule of thumb this would be correct, however I leery as to whether your cables are truly 20awg?I'm using 6 foot Tronsmart 20awg cables (basically made by the same manufactuer that made the cables for aukey), it has no problem with my Quick Charge 2.chargers, Battery monitor widget report fast charging at 2500mah when fast charging.  I also occasionally used the same cable in my living room with an older 2.1amp normal charger and it can hit 2000mah no problem either.
I'm in Canada and it's being offered through one of our providers here. I didnt realize it was a special edition... I was actually going to pick gold but they didn't have it available as an option for me :(  I dont even know if we'll have Samsung pay up here but at least I'll have the warranty... Still looking forward to it!
Sudden change in temp?   Did you let it get below freezing? 
The Active doesn't have Samsung Pay either and is only available from AT&ampT (in the US).  Verizon has stated they haven't carried and will not carry the Active.
I see this when this it's a network issue.. Are you side by side trying to open the same link on the Note 4 and 5? Otherwise I doubt its your phone.
I use the app Tapet. It randomly generates wallpapers. So the wallpaper is never the same. 
Can't even use Samsung Pay because I have the International Version.
So cool! I just did this, it's awesome! (for anyone else who wants to do this, you have to buy the full note buddy app to adjust the volume down, otherwise it's very loud by default. Lightsaber sounds can be found on zedge, search for Lightsaber on, and Lightsaber off) 
That would be ideal they just charge so much for it. I think it puts out more power and I think Android Police said it has its own fan because it puts out quite a bit of heat. 
Elements Financial credit union at Eli Lilly :( no Samsung Pay for me
I think you'll enjoy [this video](https://youtu.be/QEzhxP-pdos). 
That transparent purple was my shit
I can't say. Generally, in the US, it's the carriers that handle warranty issues and I've heard that some check some don't. I really don't know how it may work in your situation. 
Not a huge difference, as the Note 4 had an excellent screen as well. But the Note 5 definitely has a better screen. It seems to me that it has better contrast. The blacks are phenomenal. It seems to be sharper. I have also read the new display is much more efficient power-wise.
No. It's highly unlikely. The app is through the play store so it's not a virus and the game itself is just a file so you'll be fine as long as you use emuparadise site for your games. If you have any questions just let me know and I'll help you out.
Its gorilla glass 4, isnt it supposed to be pretty damn resilient? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ObyPq-OmO0
Phone is pretty slippery, if you have shallow pockets, just be aware. Also, samsung pay is amazing. 
If they ever release it on T-Mobile (sold on a payment plan) I'll jump on it asap.  I miss my nexus 5 and AOSP in general
I use only a dbrand skin. So far I've dropped it a couple times and there is only a tiny scratch. Note these drops were off my bed and it hit the wooden frame. So far though the phone is doing well. 
No aosp because of the Exynos
Not for note taking or tasks, but Sketchbook Express has really blown me away. The things you can do with the app, for free even, are very, very cool. You can really make some good doodles with it. 
Will this switch everything? Pics, music, apps, everything? Or just what's on my SD card
I have the Sprigen Neo Hybrid Crystal and it still looks nice IMO. clear not hiding the nice colour and the silver rim is a nice touch
it is saying that samsung syncadapters is using the battery and u don't know what that is I don't have sidesync on right now
Plus one on changing the cable. I swapped the cable as well and now fast charge every time. 
Huh, I couldn't figure it out on my phone. It kept on trying to DL the chrome app, not the .apk file for a phone app. I have an Asus tablet PC I use so it wasn't that big of a deal. 
Scribble racer. It's almost like cheating using the s pen
With the link you posted, click on Get your gift, then enter your email and click on Get Your Gift again, fill out the info and upload copy of your receipt of buying/leasing the phone.  It's confusing because it keeps referencing iPhone.
Thanks for the tip! It one less icon off my bar.
If you have Google Photos installed, this might be the back up data consumption of your photos.

Totally worth it. Pocketcasts is worth the money. Started listening to microbrewr podcasts through pocketcasts.
I don't know how to wipe cache on stock, isn't that something that's done through a custom recovery?  I really don't want to do a factory reset but maybe I have to.  I don't see what would stop it from happening again though.  I can't believe I'm having this problem with a high end 2015 flagship.
Took me over two months, a dozen emails, and a Twitter exchange between Samsung Support, T-Mobile, and myself to get Prizelogic to finally finish my Netflix promo.I bought my Note 5 on launch day. Good luck. It can be done though. Just keep at it. 
Believe it or not that's what I'm at right now! 8hrs 15mins off charger. I'm at 67% w/ 2hr 24min SOT. Which if the percent is linear it would be around 7.5 hrs SOT! I usually get 5 hrs but there's always a occasion I get 6 sometimes even 7hrs.
Woops, I actually have a different calendar widget in that screenshot called 'event flow'
Interesting. I signed up when black Friday when I got the phone on sale. I put a BofA card in which I know works with S-Pay.
I'm using themer and I have a zooper widget. I have it set up so that on tap, the time links to my alarm setup, the date links to calendar, the weather links to weather, but when tapping the next event instead of linking to my calendar it links to weather. Any ideas?  
I own both (not because I'm greedy, but job-related) and while I think they're both terrific devices, I'd choose the Note 5 if I could only have one. I like the S Pen, and although the curved screen looks good, it doesn't add enough functionality. I also prefer the way the Note 5 feels in the hand with its curved back. 
I didn't mean to hold the kickstand with my hand. I meant using the kickstand so I no longer have to tilt the phone with my hand when laying down or such.
Nor a single stutter and I have at least 1gb of ram free at any given moment.  
I really like my Pebble time. It lasted me 8 days on battery and looks fantastic. It's also water proof so you don't have to take it off when washing your hands or showering
I can confirm text scheduling. I don't use the built in email. 
I have not noticed anything odd before, but I will check tomorrow morning as I go from 100% to 90% and will update you. Overall, here is my current battery state: http://imgur.com/a/xEYSj***note that I did put it on the wireless charger for about 1minutes at about 6 pm, but the rest of the day the phone was off charge and at work with me. To describe my everyday usage: * I do not use any package dis-abler * I use 3 custom widgets (KWGT) on my home screen that show:    * Time/Date and upcoming calendar events     * Current weather for my current location (uses GPS)    * Current usage of CPU, RAM and Total Storage used* I have sync/push enabled for:    * amazon shopping    * reddit sync and reddit slide (debating which app I like more)     * email (using AquaMail pro)    * Google hangouts     * Steam app (for steam chat) * I keep my screen brightness on Auto with smart stay enabledI spend an average of 2 hours of screen on time at work and then the rest is mornings and after work, or messaging through out the day. For example, today (with the pictures of my battery usage above), I spent about 2 hours developing a new widget in KWGT, add that to the rest of my usage and I'm over 4 hours of screen on time.All of the above said, if you get ~9 hrs out of the battery, I would lean towards that being a defect. 
I don't really remember but I can show you a picture of my purchase as proof. I don't know how to post it but please tell me how to
Use any Quick Charge 2.power bank. If it's specifically Anker you're looking at though, [this is the one I have](http://smile.amazon.com/Quick-Charge-Anker-PowerCore-10050/dp/B013HSQXZC/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&ampqid=1450174921&ampsr=8-4&ampkeywords=anker+quick+charge+2+0). Works great and charges my phone from 30% to full in just under 45 minutes. Another option if size isn't a factor and if you'd prefer 2 USB ports is the [Aukey QC 2.Power Bank](http://smile.amazon.com/Aukey-10000mAh-Portable-External-Supported/dp/B011U0AY22/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&ampqid=1450175003&ampsr=8-6&ampkeywords=anker+quick+charge+2+0).
Buy Anker or Aukey or buy nothing at all is my motto when it comes to chargers and usb cables.
That really sucks though. Hopefully there is a fix though as i know people with androids and fb and fb messenger that this isn't happening too. 
I've noticed mine is the same way! I have the fast charging one. It often takes me three attempts to get it work. When I get home I'll try it with a normal samsung charger and not the fast charger.
I too was torn between Note 5 and 6P, tried both, settled with Note 5. For me deciding factors were: beautiful design, objectively the best camera, one of a kind display (colour reproduction, great outdoor visibility), and of course speed.I initially thought I'd use the heck out of s-pen but I am not using it as much as I thought I would. But honestly, somehow making my s-pen stuck in the right direction, does make me nervous.
Just checked for the update on ATT and had it. Updating now! 
I'm only concerned with how it does on drawing apps and I know at least one that I use had a built in calibration setting. Fingers crossed my bamboo one works but I found a really cool one on wacoms store that's made for the note, it looks just like an ink pen, very nice.
I have the case, I like it it's a nice case. It's obviously not the most protective case as you know already when the cover is on the screen it covers the left side of your phone, all of the back and the front. The parts that are exposed are the top bottom and power button side (right side) if the device.Now what exactly do you mean when you ask if it turns to yellow?
I sure hope so! I have android system, os and mediaserver killing my battery every day :(
Accept they don't support even most major banks... 
Looking forward to this - though since I have an unlocked device I'm fine with just waiting for it to be pushed in a month.First step will be to find a dark theme.
get the 64gb version to be safe.. Battery wise I guess anything beats your 1 hour usage atm so )
Yep. I'm on edge. If you do a two year contract they sell you the phone for 5instead of 25
Positives to the international model: root, no bloatware, custom recoveryPositives to the AT&ampT model: Samsung Pay and monthly payments instead of all at once.
I don't have it either.   You can put it in quick settings though. 
Thanks for this, but inb4 you get murdered for that font.
If you're referring to the keyboard notification, it'll always show up when you've got a keyboard open. It's designed that way so that if you need to switch keyboards (say, to a Japanese language one, for example) you'll be able to do so quickly.
Nova, themes (material black is good for clean and battery), and package disabled pro. See the Note 5 XDA thread and import the basic list of packages to disable. You'll need to modify for the Verizon specific stuff, but should be a good start.LinkMe: package disabler pro (Samsung).
Got one in the mail a few weeks back assumed that was it.  Then got an email last week saying it was backordered,  later the same day i got another email that said it had shipped.  Then i got home from work,  same day,  and the second one was in my door waiting for me. Also got a free one from best buy so i got 3 for free. Bedroom,  living room,  work.  Funny thing is once i figured out the battery drain i don't even need to charge it at work anymore. 
I have this case: http://amzn.com/B00VQKYSF6 looks cool and feels great in the hand. Buttons have a satisfying click to them still and wireless charging is not affected. Only downside is that it is a little hard to get off if you want to feel your amazing phone unadulterated every once in awhile. Overall very satisfied
Why would you say zagg wouldn't fit properly? I have zagg on mine and I live by them. On every phone I buy I always get a screen protector and it always comes down to zagg. Best stick, best protection, looks good on the phone and fits perfectly.Now it doesn't go to the edges of the screen but no screen protector does anymore. I've tried several from my s3, s4, LG g3, iPhone 5, 6, 6+, note 5, nexus 6, and iPhone 6+. I'm not just talking about one phone or one brand of phone either. I like to test phones and buy them. Always go for zagg. I don't understand why people go off brand. I rarely buy brand names of anything in my life but Vera Bradley and Zagg. That's literally it.
My secret is that with my commute by bus and Note 3 was wearing out so for very few bucks I bought an external battery/charger. It still works with my Note 5 so I have no worries at all.
Certainly has impressed me (battery life, screen, thinness, general speed, multitasking) but going to try Moto X Pure for next couple of days and see which I prefer more. Really missing customization I am able to do through root etc. Note 5 tho is in my top 3 slots for phone of the year. 
Sorry to hijack your thread, but I also have a group chat related question.Is there any way to change the title of a group chat? For example, they are always just called Contact Name, Contact Name, +2 more... I would like to change the way this displays because in some cases I have two chats where the first two names are the same but the rest of the group is different.
The OTG method uses Smart Switch as well - It's capable of transferring more content that way. In my last job, I set up a number of executives migrating from iOS to S6 edges, and the OTG method is the best solution.
Android has apple music now if you want to stay in the iTunes bubble
Bet it still has fingerprints
I use both OneDrive and Google Drive on my phone. Google for photos and some videos and OneDrive for documents. There's only so much storage they allow.
hi, im in the same situation as Gen_Dave i have a note 3 and was looking to buy a note 5 from an ebay seller called t-dimension10, is it worth the upgrade and is it safe, thanks :)
Same here. I tried Go SMS, Textra, Verizon's Messages+, Handcent and Chomp SMS. Always ended up going back to google messenger. It's simple and light and offers quick reply.
Yep, since Samsung pay only works for domestic phones and these were made for non US.
Couldn't you just have small panes of glass that are the correct dimensions? Would be much cheaper/easier than having to peel the film off of hundreds or thousands even
I normally recommend tempered glass, but because the glass on the Note 5 rounds off around the edges, a lot of glass screen protectors won't adhere around the edge. They look like they're peeling, hence the halo effect people have mentioned in the comments.I switched to a high quality plastic screen protector, which is flexible so doesn't have this same problem as tempered glass. Much better solution for this phone imo. 
Thanks! these look awesome! Think I'll either go for the one that's actually a back case only and then get a screen protector with it or the one that doesnt contain card slots. I'm not bothered by price, if I'm spending that much on a phone then I'm gonna spend the extra needed to get a good, solid case.
http://imgur.com/ylpthGeNova launcherCryten iconNothing special. 
I've got a Ringke clear case on a white Note 5 and I love it. It certainly does cover up certain features like the aluminum sides and the curvature of the phone. When using the phone at night, the sides of the case can become illuminated a little bit, which I think is actually a nice little bonus. I really like that there are connected covers for the headphone jack as well as the usb port.
Moneys not really an issue as I'm going to be keeping the phone for a couple years so I don't mind spending a little more. Do you find a noticeable difference between the screens on the N4 vs N5?
https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0146G5BIO/ref=yo_ii_img?ie=UTF8&amppsc=1I use this one. I always lose my cards so a wallet case is perfect
To commenters replying with mediocre results of only 4-6 hours of SOT.... wow... this  is for 1 (one) day! Does anyone ever stop and realize you're  talking about only being able to look at your screen for 4-6 hours a day? Do you have a job? A life? Feel free to downvote... but just think about it... then go hug your kid or make dinner or clean your house... you know... Something productive.
I had the same issue when repeating the same song. I turned on the sound enhancement feature and it hasn't happened since
I wouldn't bother, because they'll just give you another Note 5 cable. But yes, please call and bitch them out. That's what I did, Then I went on Amazon and bought a Note 4 cable and haven't had a problem since.
I haven't noticed this at all. I find the that the buttons have a nice tactile click to them. But I also keep it in a case that encloses the buttons... Maybe you're getting dirt or something in them?
Its cool. To get rid of the notification I just called my voicemail and hung up. Seemed to clear it. 
No one needs the stylus and the accompanying apps. You just preferred to have them, and therefore you were weighing the pros and cons, and went with what's more important to you. Samsung made a phone, designed it how they wanted to, and never held a gun to your head forcing you to buy it. It was your choice to purchase, as it was your choice to not protect it.
This. And you should be able to pick several pictures and the phone will switch them every hour. 
Thankfully my main card is an AMEX card so I have had fun since I bought my Note 5 and started using Samsung Pay (since last Saturday).  I have used it daily and has not failed on me yet, except for one time which when I tried the same register again on a different day, it worked, so I think it was human error by the first cashier).  I just need to remember to tell the cashier when I pay to process the payment as a credit card before I pay with Samsung Pay because they still get surprised when I use it.
Some folks made mention on a screen shot from a ROM about whether or not there is a way to get speed indicators in the notification shade. I don't mess with speed test because of the ads. Assuming these folks avoiding root also dont have many adblocking options.
There's  a bunch of pictures of cases in this thread if you are interested in checking it out: https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxynote5/comments/3mni99/can_anyone_share_pictures_of_your_case_andor_skin/I am using an otterbox commuter - really protective but definitely not slim. I think I would recommend checking out Spigen of you want something in between a rugged case and a flimsy one. I've handled their rugged armour and slim armour cases in store and they seem like a good compromise. Thinking of switching to Spigen for day to day and keeping the otterbox for camping and hiking. http://www.spigen.com/collections/galaxy-note-5
For some reason when I use nova the text size in my widgets gets bigger.. minor annoyance that made me stay with touchwiz
I have had the note 2,3,4 and now 5 and I find myself not using the spen that much, but I do use it when I need to highlight certain text and that works great
Not currently since I use it only on my tablet (phones broken atm) but I think I do remember lots of data usage. Hopefully patched out soon. 
Same thing happened to me last night haha. I don't know of a perm fix but I just deleted the picture.
Note 2, 3, 5, I've killed them all in no time.  Now I carry an external battery, otherwise I wouldn't make it to lunch. No worries. 
Mine is fine after disabling bloat. But yeah more battery is always welcomed.
Hey if you can't derive the context from the title and the comments I really feel as bad for you as the people still putting their pens in backwards. In a perfect world if someone wanted to make mods to their device they would head over to xda, not reddit..Not here where people are STILL asking why after freshly rooting with noble kernel they are getting reboots on calls and are now looking to return a defective device. All because they couldn't be troubled to read the xda guide linked in the how to document..
I was coming here to post if anyone has a solution to the exploding S Pen. Here and on the web it seems that Samsung is doing nothing about it. Looks like I'm going to pony up the cash to buy a new one.
Since I'd had a note 3 and note 4 previously, it really bugged me going back to a big phone with the Nexus 6P and not having the s-pen, which I really did use a lot with my previous note phones.  I could use it as a mouse when logged into my virtual desktop work pc when in meetings to actually be productive and get real work done and pull open Excel and Word docs easily from our work servers.  Of course that is a rare real world use, but I also loved using the s-pen for making grocery and to-do lists on my old phones.  I also really hated not having the multi-window and pop-up window features on the 6P.  I also found the one-handed use mode on my Note 4 very useful, and again there was nothing like that on the 6P.  It just seems like oversight to not have those kind of utilities on a phone as big as the 6P.  So yeah, I'm going to T-mobile today to Jump to a Note 5.  If the battery life and lag issues are still present, then I'll just return it and get an Iphone 6s.   
Might be defective I'd get it replaced under warranty 
Nor can he/she expect us to know what this refers to. Does your launcher normally look like that? Is that your regular homescreen? Is it the shading on that pull bar that's bothering you? The app in the top right corner? The icon in the top right?If you want help with your situation, you have to explain your situation.
I have used Nova for a few years on different phones,  TouchWiz (the default launcher) has themes that can be downloaded. The version of TouchWiz on the Note5 is pretty quick. At least as fast as Nova seemed. 
Try update the app to latest version in Samsung App Store (if available)
That's incredibly nice of you to do. I myself recently paid Samsung $9for a replacement. 
&gtFirst and foremost, you??ll be pleased to know??I found no memory management issues??at all during my usage with the ROM.Awesome! Hopefully T-Mobile won't take too long to get this out.
That's funny you say that. I remember my s4 (my phone before my note 3 and 5) lost it after an ota update. 
Now I have Nexus 5 and 6.0. But! I have bad speakers, bad sound from headphones, cracks where buttons and sim tray are, bad camera. I literally don't have any good thing in Nexus 5 about hardware, it is total garbage. But at least it was cheap. Look at Nexus 6. Bad camera with bad focus, problems with screen, problems with back if the phone, bad headphone sound. All nexus are cheap in so many things compared to other phones. Even no AptX. Even Nexus 6p already don't have AptX and it already have bad sound from headphones. But I could forgive cheap Nexus 5. But I can't forgive such hardware in premium phones. But I am too afraid about Touchwiz to go from Nexus. 
1-Note 5 Battery isnt replaceable,i suggest you carry a power bank with you? if you need a full battery replacement, just go to a certified samsung dealer and request a battery change2-Make sure you keep some space on the phone,although it doesnt have a big downfall,but the phone still needs to cache some stuff and install updates,I suggest filling only 2/3 of the storage,use dropbox for photos3.The phone is snappy af,it does what you want it to do and even more,furthermore,this year they have removed so much weight of the touchwi interface so having top of the line phone with top of the line performance is no surprise
Change the wallpaper and there is a button to turn it off is how I got rid of it
D-brands does have a skin for the lens part. I'm not sure if they sell that separately though. 
That's something on your end, friend. These screen shots are very clear.
Yeah, I hear ya. I took my barely there case off and swapped it out for a skinomi techskin, carbon fiber. It's so beautiful, but I'm a lot less protected. But I appreciate how smoothly it glides into my pocket. And holding it is somewhat of a pain, but beauty is pain. I'm sure I'll get used to it. And I also swapped out my fake glass screen protector for a real one. So, as long as it doesn't take too much of a tumble, I should be fine...
I got confirmation of the phone payments on us also.  To bad It's a 8 week wait for the check to arrive. Still waiting on the confirmation of the ultimate  test drive promo.  That should be another $10(+$10in google play credit). Since your on tmobile you might be eligible for this promo as well since you signed up for jump on demand.  http://www.t-mobile.com/offer/jump-on-demand-samsung-galaxy-note5.htmlIt'll add another $78 off your total lease.
I've sold on there before.. A Note 3 in fact and it went rather smoothly. Received payment via PayPal pretty quickly. 
its not an actual lag in the animation, its the time it takes to do the action.  I'll press the multitasking button. wait 1 second. wait 2 seconds. Now its open. the animation is instant though.  the same wait will happen when hitting the home button and it does take another second to redraw the apps and widgets.

Nope, unfortunately. Only ones who can unlock it are the original carrier or maybe a 3rd party unlocking service.
I own both phones, pictures just look better on the note 5 vs note 4. I do not know how or why though
Snote integrates with Evernote pretty well. If you move snotes out if the Snote notebook, they also become available on any device.
Works great! But uninstalled because whenever I used my fingerprint to sign in anywhere, it would kick me back to the home screen.
96% done also have a screen shot of before update and will have one of after so we can see what changes if its not a full os update.
Okay am I crazy or does it look like there's a hole in the side to charge the Zerolemon battery? You can charge them independently?Don't they both usually go through the same port on the bottom?OP *please* give us an update when you receive it. I'm very curious and I **loved** my Zerolemon battery/case for my S3. I might get this. 
Did you try pulling down on the notification? 
I get about 3.5-4h SoT but I work in a concrete and metal office with crappy signal, drive to work on backroads with crappy signal, and live in an old house surrounded by huge trees. So I don't expect much.
I also received the notification (AT&ampT), no idea yet on what it is.
I stand corrected, last week I received a white one a day after I received a shipping confirmation.  Today I come home to another, this time a black one. So now I have 3 free Samsung puck wireless chargers lol and they all have the same issue which could very well be fixed in a future Samsung software update
Pay it forward? 
Ah,  I see what you are saying.  Yeah like someone else said I usually just hold the home button then to launch it.  Hopefully you'll find a different solution then! 
Check out the Samsung Galaxy Life app. They give away stuff exclusively for Galaxy owners. So far, I got a 6mos iFlix (similar to Netflix on where I live) subscription, around five vouchers for restaurants (discounts and freebies), and we also get to have one free ebook every month through Kindle.
i always leave NFC off
Samsung India dealt with this in a craftily unethical way. First of all, to get the free charger, buying the phone isn't enough. You have to download an app called My Samsung Rewards, and sign up on it with your phone number and IMEI number. Then, you'll have to wait for two days for the free wireless charger to show up as a little tab in one of the sections in the app. The charger shows up in that section as a coupon code. You are supposed to go to Samsung's India online store, buy the charger and apply the coupon code to the purchase.Worst part, this entire process is never explained to you at any point in the purchase if you're doing it online. It's tucked away in the offer's fine print. 
EXACT same situation. Don't care about the SD card, but want my phone to last at least four years. Commenting for future reference!
You can use Samsung Pay on normal credit card machines even without NFC as long as it is a swipe style machine(versus a slot style one).
Trust me, Google  knows because the playstore has a feedback system. Your comment came off as entitled.
Go to text msg app, settings, notifications, pop up notifications
No issue at all with ram management. Initially there were few but lately with updates the phone is a beast.
My camera is awful indoors, my brothers G3 bests it. I'm planning on returning mines for a replacement, and if it's the same, going back to the 6P. 
It should probably work in the US, however these are the basic differences from my understanding:- No US warranty- May not have the correct bands (check this)- Not able to use Samsung PayI was actually going to get the international variant but after seeing these three points I changed my mind and returned it and just payed the extra premium for a carrier specific version.
I'm getting 23 hours before I need to charge. I work with spotty signal for 8 hours and at the house, no WiFi.
Stay away from BofA! Is there a supported Credit Union you an move to? As a possible easier solution you can get an Amex card instead
I didn't have any bubbles and I used a Yoohoo or something I can't remember. Because the Note 5 has curved edges I found that even like a 1mm off from center it just bothered me with my case. I could see like a double light from one side. I tried to re-apply multiple times and I was just always slightly off center. I might try to order one again sometime but for now I'll take my chances. 
Yup i know i wanted to use a black one as well because it looks great and it saves battery too :/
Does it have a magnet to hold phone in place  from light bumps?Does it continually light up the screen every 3minutes after it reaches 100% charge?
Can't seem to find smart manager. The only manager that comes up when searching the settings is application manager
What brand of fast charger? Been looking for one after choetech fast charger failed on me twice.
Download a new theme to get rid of awful default colour scheme, download a launcher (I use Nova personally), transfer stuff over using an app/cable, set up to your liking. There's no set way of doing things, it depends on what you want to do tbh. 
That's the point , I already went to Samsung and they got the pen out ! So I'm not sure if they just pulled it out the wrong way or what! I would buy a new phone and sell this one for a 100$ instead of mailing it if i had to.
Not gonna lie, mine would regularly get that with even watching YouTube and video podcasts on lte
I can't believe you don't have 1 drop of cell standby on there before you installed Package Disabler. I have to use automateit to turn my wifi off when I leave home or I'll have about 40% cell standby drainage. And just to be clear, I've turned off wifi calling (t-mobile), also went into phone and turned off VoIP calling... only disabling the wifi keeps the cell standby down to about 14%. Totally stumped. 
* Show people how the multitasking works (long press the left button)* Show people how the S-pen works in regards to games (Hearthstone, Pokemon Shuffle and Tales From The Borderlands are great for this)* Show people how the S-pen works with it's own built in features* Show off the camera and its video functionality (4K video, 60FPS video)* Show off the themes store (helps people that don't want to use launchers)* Adaptive fast charging
Nice!  What font is that, by the way?  Available in the Galaxy store?  
https://youtu.be/M14CWF5gnT8Follow these tips to help with battery life, and set your display to basic, from adaptive. 
You've said you like to doodle - get the Note 5. Absolutely worst case, if something does happen to the Spen, you still have a great phone. 
Use Google Voice. I use it just for voicemail.
It's been useless to me so far as a Wells Fargo member. Android Pay works, Apple Pay works (on my wife's iPhone), but Samsung? Nah, they are too good for my bank.
I swapped the cable from my wireless charger and fast charge works fine now. 
How'd you record the screen?
I usually get 6 and a half hours of SOT with about 10% of battery left.
Just things don't match up or make sense. Like screen on time between the stock battery app and gsam will be way off (I took screens of one occasion). The last straw for me was when I opened gsam and it was telling me I had over 10days on battery. http://i31.photobucket.com/albums/c363/joel_thc/Mobile%20Uploads/Screenshot_2015-09-26-08-23-12.jpghttp://i31.photobucket.com/albums/c363/joel_thc/Mobile%20Uploads/Screenshot_2015-09-26-08-23-29.jpghttp://i31.photobucket.com/albums/c363/joel_thc/Mobile%20Uploads/Screenshot_2015-09-26-08-24-10.jpghttp://i31.photobucket.com/albums/c363/joel_thc/Mobile%20Uploads/Screenshot_2015-09-26-08-24-22.jpg
Hah i feel you. I like using my chase card so much more than my boa card because of better rewards. As contemplating getting an Amex card. 
Oh I love that back skin. I have the carbon fiber. I may have to order that one. 
I'm pretty happy with supershieldz. I got a couple bubbles that are very tiny but no halo what so ever. It's all about how it's applied but really it's not hard at all. I'm jittery as hell and was still able to get it centered just about perfect. The reason there's no halo is simply because it's dimensions are smaller than the screen. It just needs to be centered.
I can't see why there would be any extra light. Both the Camera and LED flash are sticking out of the glass, and have black covers around them.
I had an AT&ampT note 5. I returned it and bought an unlocked note 5. It??s worth it. Already rooted, and not regretting it. I don??t think the AT&ampT/Verizon variant will be rooted any time soon..don??t hold your breath
Also another thing to note about #3 is if you root, you lose Samsung Pay since it utilizes Knox.
This looks totally awesome. You should make a video.
so from what i gathered the screen is actually holding up well i guess.Have never tried gorilla glass 4 prior to this, missing those days where my galaxy nexus can be thrown into my bag with keys and random stuff and not even a single micro scratch
the front cam via the stock camera app does a bit of angle/perspective correction and from what I can tell it doesn't do it in Snapchat perhaps that's why it doesn't look right? 
Never had any issues that you are concerned about. Battery life is excellent for me and never had a wifi problem.  The only issue I had was with the USB cable that comes in box is a Piece of shit and will stop fast charging.  So I have to replace it.Edit for mistake... I did replace my USB cable and it's been fine for past few months. Always in fast charging mode 
Didn't the terms say it couldn't be combined with another offer? I applied for pretty much all the promos I could apply for and so far only got the wireless charger and $5best buy card. Didn't even think I would get the BB promo since it was also Samsung Pay related. 
Disable Google location services and install Doze from play Store if ya ain't got root... Other wise greenify, power nap and amplify that mofo
I don't have that smart manager app, how do I get it?
mine too.  Verizon USA!  although in all honesty, the black (really dark blue to me) is pretty nice and so far the 32GB hasn't been a problem but still...
What are some of the system apps people want to disable? Does it help with battery life or something?
If you root the phone, use package disabler pro, xposed +amplify, greenify, and wakelock detector you see some battery improvement.
Quickly copying or cropping an image or part of an image or Web page and sending it to someone. Within a few seconds I can see something and have sent it to anyone via any method, from almost any app. 
Considering the phone came with a fast charger and was presumably designed for it, probably not
Even if the OS is slower, this phone's hardware can handle it as fast as Lollipop no problem. I'll be getting it as soon as it comes out.
Do you have app optimization active? 
Are they photos that are synced via facebook or something else? If so you cant delete them only unsync them via settings but im not sure if this is the case.
Try going into Settings and Applications and find the Messenger app and force close it. Closing recent apps doesn't remove it from memory, I don't think.
Thank you so much! I have another question for you, is there any way to turn on the setting where you minimize the screen by dragging it down? I always do it on accident when I'm trying to see my notifications. I remember you could turn it off with the Note 4 but I can't find it on here.
Don't disable everything. Some things like samsung pay will stop working, just do a bit of research on this sub, I think it depends on what you want to keep using.I disabled:- the facebook app (notorious for wakelocks that affect battery life) and facebook messenger- s-voice, voice assistant and voice wakeup- all the samsung email packags (I use gmail)- samsung calendar (I use gcal)- the microsoft office apps as I don't use them- flipboard (I use google now as a launcher)- samsung gear- Milk (samsung music app)Probably more things I could disable but with that list I get really good battery life, usually a full day with no problems.I do use samsung pay (it's pretty amazing) and s-health (quite nice) so I leave these enabled and on and my battery life doesn't seem to be too affected.Hope that helps.ps. I recommend get a good wireless charger if you don't have one yet, so convenient especially if you have one at work if you sit at a desk.
Isn't jump on demand a form of insurance?
All of T-Mo apps. My Account app can't be disabled on-device, so I had to hide it in adb. For Samsung apps though, I left Samsung Pay, Smart Manager, S Pen, and Galaxy Apps active because they're integral to the phone's function.
Almost every android phone has NFC builtin. You can use an app from the play store to read and store nfc data. You could then use your phone as the nfc card so to speak
Is Samsung Pay already available there? If it is, it could be for microchip-embedded cards or something. I'm in the US with att, nothing here. 
With my glass screen protector,  I found the rubber pen tip sticks too much when writing.   The plastic tip is perfect though! 
It looks like you are getting 7 hours out of just 31% of your battery. Thats pretty damn good IMO.
So is this just a cable issue?  If so, they must be shipping bad cables with all their phones, because using both the S6 and Note5 provided chargers and cables, I'm having the exact same issue on the Note5, but not the S6.  So to me, this points to a problem with the Note5, and not the charger or cable.  I'm also getting mixed info from TMobile support and Samsung support.  TMobile claims it's a known issue by Samsung and they are working on a fix.  I call Samsung, and they say they're not aware of such issue.  So frustrating.
Is it glass? 
Right, but battery drain is the real problem, and if it can be offset somehow, that would be just as well. 
I guess it depends on what you do with the phone. I can get 1hours playing just videos, but 4 hours max browsing reddit. 
How do you take photos like this... Even in lowlight. I really cant imagine.  Is this all on auto? Or is thisall on pro and edited after? 
So, as far as battery life, I'm very pleased.  I've been getting 5 to 6 hours of SoT on mobile data over the course of a 14+ hour day.  I do have apps like Facebook and Messenger installed and two emails on push.  I would like to root, but...meh, I must be getting old because I don't want to wipe the phone and set it up again.Which brings us to the second point.  Yes there is root, but it trips Knox.  And I believe only the T-Mobile version in the US can be rooted.Hope that helps you.  I really love this phone crazy, since I came from a Nexus and  was always knocking on Samsung and TW.  Software isn't horrible (barring RAM management...my biggest gripe), speeds is great, camera is amazing, build is superb...a really well-rounded phone.
If you can't find a solution, check you more shortcuts from the play store. It may have an option to add an icon to your home screen to shut off mobile data. 
Lol wut? You realise the variance introduced by mobile reception is one of the big drains on your battery? It takes a hell of a lot of power to search for, negotiate and connect on mobile. Furthermore, if, for instance, you live at the very edge of reception for a tower your benchmark scores SOT will be absolutely shit compared to mine if I lived right next to one. Barring that fact if you have provider A and I have provider B their reception strengths may vary day to day, minute to minute depending on traffic. This means your suggestion is even less than useless, it's retarded. At least if you measure it on WiFi you can guess that a) you're somewhat nearby to the router and will get good reception and b) complete knowledge/control of traffic on your network. That's the only reasonable possible benchmark to compare any sort of SOT with Internet connections. Everyone is now dumber for hearing your argument. I award you no points and may God have mercy on your soul. 
On nova, toggle the dock to off. Under desktop use an 8x8 grid and enable subgrid placement. Under icons and labels use small icons. You can then place an icon at the bottom center and the ones around it
Sorry for the delay.  It's called poweramp.  
I got a about 5.5 hours SoT and 9 hours overall the day after I activated my Note 5. Best battery life I have ever gotten from any phone.
1-Settings , privacy and safety, make sure Google location history is off then turn your location off2-scroll down to developer options and change the animations to .5x 3-backup and reset , use the auto restart option.4-play around with the S.pen option5-download packge disabler &amp disable all the apps in pink6-optmize the apps you use in smart manager.I usually hit 6 hours with 10% left..I hope that helps
Yup same Issue eq will only work correctly in music player.. On Spotify it will work until I change the song or song location. I have to restart the app to get it to work again. It worked just fine on my note 4.....
Actually I think it might have just been a coincidence but Verizon had an update for all Note 5's on that date or some time before that.
I switched from the S6 edge, to the iPhone 6 plus (for 1days, can't get used to iOS), then to the Note 5. I think the Note 5 is slightly better than the S6 edge. The screen is gorgeous and it'd surprisingly small considering it has a huge screen. Maybe it was because I used the 6 Plus for a while and that phone was just huge. The Spen to me is a gimmick, but it has its nice features especially to show off to friends. Camera and speaker are fairly equivalent quality wise for both. The screen gets really bright in outdoors though. Not that the S6 edge screen doesn't get bright enough, but the Note 5 makes it easy for me to use my phone even if I wear my sunglasses outdoors. All in all, I really liked my upgrade. There are also glass screen protectors for the Note 5 but not for the S6 edge, so there's that. I think you'll be happy with the Note 5. I don't have any comments on the OPT though Edit: sorry, forgot to include battery life. The battery life is insane. No greenify, all stock, gps always on, Facebook app installed, I can easily get 4 to 4.5 hours SOT. (To me, that's great, I get like 2.5 to 3 on the S6)
I was curious and re-read your post, then did some digging. The reason you're getting a great deal of downvotes is because you're referring to a comment that OP made (that's a bit buried - I had to go through his profile to find it), and it became a bit more clear as to what OP did - he actually removed a few other parts INSIDE the phone. If you had been more specific on this particular point, no one would have given you the level of animosity that you were provided. I think most people just kind of forgot what the inside of the phone looks like (where the battery sits). Everyone's assuming that the mod is simply a new back. It's a bit more involved. You understood this, but I don't think it was immediately clear to everyone else, and probably would have helped a great deal had you explained it. 
I personally like Three, for their unlimited data, currently on ??27 Sim Only and get all you can eat mins, data, and SMS.
The Facebook Messenger app is a bloated piece of shit. It's will hiccup on any phone. I hope you mean SoT for battery life. Regardless, you didn't say what you're doing on the phone during an average battery cycle. OP: Updates often depend on carrier. The TMo Note5 has already had three updates. My average battery is pretty good. 5+ hours SoT with moderate to heavy use. Email, text, some videos, Facebook, no gaming at all. I love the phone myself. Samsung Pay is awesome and it's the first phone I've had in awhile that I haven't felt the need to root. 
So there's no quick way to get a floating calculator window on my screen now? :/ I have to manually open the app and squeeze it down to size, then go back into my other app. 
The display is broken. If you have a warranty, hand it into a Samsung store to get it fixed.
If you can upload a screenshot of your battery usage, we might be able to offer some advice.
Uh,  you're the one making a huge deal warranting multiple responses to a joke. Calm your tits, sprintguy. Do you write off emails to the networks when a TV show makes a joke you don't agree with?  
It's a fantastic phone, I'm coming from iPhone then nexus 4 &amp 5 and everyone around me has iphones 6. Note 5 is the best by far, wireless charging, stylus, amazing camera, and Samsung pay that's just so cool. I'm starting to sound like a real fan boy and that's really not my style lol..Only minor issues are software related (close all button awkwardly placed in the app switcher, small things... )Coming from an iPhone there is an adaptation but overall at this point it's close enough in terms of software quality.Performance has been amazing for me, super smooth and fast, battery is fine usually lasts me all day, I just disabled a few bloat ware apps.And just to add, I use a lot of apps, chrome, firefox, slack, gmail, calendar, whatsapp, hangouts, a whole bunch of others, including s health (the only native samsung app with Samsung pay that I use) and switching is always immediate, I never get app reloads.I disabled s voice, the Facebook app (notorious for using a lot of battery) and use the Google now launcher instead of the touchwiz one, working real well so far.
But do you always have that notification in the notification shade?
Hey man, check out Sketchbook Express. Best drawing app you'll find for endless hours of fun with your stylus (if you're into that sort of thing).Also, Google Keep (notes) allows stylus input as of yesterday. 
Wasn't even being a smart ass either, why wait for att to give it to you when Google has had it for a while now. I use my hangouts number as a home phone for everything. It's nice to be able to text/call in an area with no signal but that has WiFi ie the local ER in my town. Had to spend a 12+ hour session in the emergency room with absolutely no signal but because of my Google voice number, I could let people know what was going on and stay in touch without being forced to email them. 
Maybe OP means the system volume, like transitioning from full blown ringtone to vibrate? Otherwise if its just media audio I use the volume buttons as well.
I pretty much only adjust my phone for work or at home.  Those 2 places I KNOW I won't have reception, and cell-standby absolutely kills the battery.  So if I'm going out for the day,  I have wifi on, Bluetooth on, location on and I'm good. If I'm going to work, I'll turn on airplane mode, but turn wifi on. I really should look into automating it based on location or wifi connection. But just fiddling a couple times a day gives me hours of battery life. 
Color doesn't matter to me :(Size does unfortunately. No options even ordering from the US??Also, I have bad experience with Bell and never will do business with them again.
Fine. I've got a pretty decent data plan so I just use spotify for music and don't store any on the phone. I also don't have that many apps. It hasn't been an issue at all.
Do you use a lot of location based apps? GPS is the reason my draw is so high. It ultimately hasn't made a ton of difference on battery but constantly switching between 5 apps with gps permissions does that for me. Maybe consider a charging cycle with your gps turned off or set to a low power mode and see if that does anything.  
Yeah that was the biggest bummer for me was no option for Samsung pay.  As for software it should be the same minus the carrier bloat... except I don't know about WHEN we will get marshmallow update and so on.  I would assume the 920c would get it before carriers as they have to test and add bloat before release, but there's no telling. Pros : can unlock bootloaderCan get titanium silverNo bloatCons: no samsung pay option (until is released in the county the phone is from, if ever)Unsure of update schedule (could end up being a pro)
I'm having the same issue. I've tried disabling apps like Samsung Pay which helped for a little but it always comes back.A restart will stop it for awhile, but then it comes back and like you said, it is 100% software related as even the one handed mode doesn't let me touch the top left when the screen shrinks.If anyone else has a solution,  I would be super grateful as well!
I was seriously considering a 6p, but couldn't pass up the black Friday sale so i got the n5. I only have one major gripe about this phone but other small minor  things (they don't really bother me but worth a mention). -if you get it on a carrier will be extremely bloated, i tried disabler pro, but it turned off some of the features, widgets i actually like on TW.-extremely slippery -finger print magnet -slight lag (as expexted with  tw, BUT for the most part it is smooth)My one major gripe,  the spen. Because its spring loaded, the spen flys out like a rocket if you drop it making it some what  difficult to find some times. I dropped my phone at work and the spen was like 5 feet away from where i dropped it (i was sitting down and had it on my lap). Then, i dropped it again and it shot into another dimension never to be found again. I ordered a replacement, but sucks because i was originally going to buy me a wireless charger (another pro over the 6p), but used the funds for a spen (which at the moment are pretty pricey.  Sorry to hear about your 6p issues, i never used one personally but it sounds like a great phone. If you dont mind touchwiz, you won't regret the n5. 
I've personally never owned a phone that was so good at low light photography as that Note5. If you're having low light issues, you're either taking photos in far too little light, or your camera is faulty. I believe you can change the exposure length in the default camera app, though, so try that and see what happens.
Settings-&gtbattery. At the bottom is a setting that says show power on status bar flip it to off. T-Mobile Note5. 
Android Police did a write up on wallpaper apps and these were their best picks! Enjoy!
It's an S-Pen and you can find them on Amazon. 
Does Samsung pay work in Canada? I'm about to purchase a new note5 and I'd love to get this deal
What is this plug in you speak of?My first and only 10to (well, 3%) was 5 hours SOT, since then it gets charged all the time by my wireless pad.  Hope it doesn't hurt the battery's lifetime too much but oh well it's awesome.
If you still have you S4 use Samsung smart switch app. It's free and it will move all that info over to your new phone.
True except my note 5 has a bug I can't find a fix for. I'm rooted and whatever custom kernel I use there is a moment when the phone won't deep sleep and all you know is after couple of hours of no use has drained 30+ percent of your battery. 
I have an artech21 little rock case and a artech21 Vivid Arkansas??and a elv case and they all work with a glass screen protector.
That was my experience too. TBH it's why I'm on an iphone now. i got tired of going out with friends and not being able to take pictures without everyone in the pic looking like freaks
It's mostly visible on darker images.. I think the pixels are messed up
&gt m-n920cThats the one i have, i dont care about bands or carriers, i was more concerned about hardware or software, i already found out i cant get Samsung pay, which i dont really care about to be completely honest, but still. It kinda sucks knowing thats not an option regardless
Yup.  64gb is good enough for me.  Instead of carrying an extra battery, I carry a portable charger that outputs 2.4A, so it charges fairly quickly.
Dudes with the ringke slim clear can you tell me if it fits tight enough to prevent little bits of dirt and crap getting under the case? I have the spigen liquid crystal and I like it, but heaps of crap gets inside it.
http://slickdeals.net/f/8180160-aukey-10400mah-quick-charge-2-0-portable-battery-pack-17?src=SiteSearchThis one is a quick charge one.  
Same, I was torn between the Note 5 and the 6+, but the whole Samsung Pay heavily influenced my decision. Can't wait till other banks, loyalty cards and Govt IDs (ID/DL) cards are supported on this system too, then I'll never have to carry my wallet again.
Same happened to me. Luckily for me, it's mostly over the back button, very little on the actual screen part. But still frustrating. I looked at a DIY video, and it's fairly complex, plus the part isn't cheap. Seems like it'd make more sense to send it to Samsung to fix.I do wonder if anyone's had any luck getting it repaired for free/discounted, or if you're stuck paying full price regardless.
settings - sound quality and effects - adapt sound you have to calibrate it but once I turned that on I had no issues
What exactly do you mean?  Did you disable snapchat or any dependent apps in package disabler?
Hey! We are likely just miles apart right now!I want this look for s6(not an edge). How hard would you say this would be for a person with little skill taking phones apart? I've taken apart an iPhone 3gs  before but that is the end of my experience. Nice job. Looks really cool!
Yes you can. You can program the menu button when double tapped for whatever app you want and if you set it on the music player, you can then change tracks by using the bezel. You will need to touch the volume option on the screen to use the bezel for volume control.
I agree the V1is going to be an upgrade from the G4
Do you have to pay 5 bucks? i didnt see a price on the store page.  whats the 5 bucks unlock?  I dont know what unread badges are D:  And what does google hot word do exactly?  Im not amazingly phone savvy.  I well educated with technology but not with phones specificly as i am not a power user of phones.  I had my HTC dna for 3-4 years, before that i had a samsung slide phone i had for 3-4 years and before that i had a razer, thats all ive had phone wise haha. (im one of those people who find it silly when people buy a new phone every year) =P  The grid options on the nova themes looked nice.  One gripe i had with stock was that wierd gap between the bottom bar and the icon space above, where that home icon is and your slide icons.  that was a waste of space i though haha.  Does it allow for any diffrent clock/weather options?  Ide love better control of how those look as most themes use white which conflicts with my backgrounds most the time.
I have two Note 5s. One of them works no problem, the other USED to work no problem until recently where i'm getting the blue light flashing on the charger. Both phones have the exact same case so i've ruled out the case. It clearly is an issue with the device itself and not the charger.
Most likely it's some kind of wake lock. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG8tghj0AYMI used to get these all the time on my old s4. This is generally what my battery looks like on the note 5 http://i.imgur.com/TjPO3J4.jpg
OEM. So it turns out to be the provided Samsung cables.  I used a third party one and it went to Fast Charging in the first try.  Very odd. 
I kind of fixed it by trying a combo of forgetting the wifi, clearing the cache, restarting the phone, turning wifi on and off. In no particular order. It just kind of started working after trying a few of these things.
I have the Otterbox Defender. Bulky? Yes. But I need the protection. So it's fine for me. 
Are you using the OEM charger or a third party QC 2.charger? 
I didn't see the no payments deal, but got on JoD with $4 off for 18 months or $72 + Netflix + Charger(Not really worth $50...more like $25)...but still it all adds up.
I like spigen cases for their design. I got the rugged armor for my note 5. It looks dope af.http://www.amazon.com/Galaxy-Spigen%C2%AE-Resilient-Ultimate-protection/dp/B010MWFUBYEdit: it's military grade drop tested which is a good assurance.
I've seen a few phones do this. Most of the time it's water damage in the charging port. Definitely look in the port for possible corrosion.
Calicase for sure, it's about the thinnest case possible aside from a skin.  It's not the grippiest case ive ever felt.  similar grip to stock back, but a different texture.http://www.amazon.com/Galaxy-CaliCase%C2%AE-Perfect-cutouts-Samsung/dp/B0159XYNE6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&ampqid=1447642971&ampsr=8-1&ampkeywords=calicase+note+5&amppebp=1447643021049&ampperid=0MBQ4AXKTS6NEARR8Q6P
Or you know, use Google maps. Or have your pictures geo tagged... 
The colors are brighter and everything 'pops' more, although the color reproduction is probably not as accurate.
Maybe it's a little too big but overall it's a nice phone and certainly the best nexus phone to be made.  Finger print scanner is Insanely fast on the 6p
Yup. Dropped mine on asphalt from about 2'. Didn't appear to have any damage, but two tiny dents on the left trim, a hairline crack, and the display was dead. 
An ordinary walk plug might not output enough for fast charging but it's more than likely your cable because I've had to switch out my cable in less than a month and everything has been good since
I love the V10, for the most part.  The build quality was amazing.  I did, however, have issues with the light bleed from the second screen.  It took me through two devices, the second worse than the first.  Then, I missed the size of the Note5 - the V1is so tall.  The camera was the best I've used in terms of control. I switched to the V1temporarily because I wanted to try the camera and the 200GB microSD card bundle was very attractive.  Really, nothing about the Note5 pushed me away.
I saw an article this week that said Chase was setting up their own mobile payment system. I'm wondering if we will ever see it. 
Nope never bought a keyboard.http://imgur.com/rmHctUv
Native apps like Smart Select and Scrapbook.... other apps like Squid (Papyrus)
Wait, what? How can you replace the glass on the phone's back???
I think the back glass is also Gorilla Glass, right?
Absolutely!When Samsung Pay was launched in September, I downloaded these APKs and installed them: [Samsung Pay Framework](http://www.apkmirror.com/apk/samsung-electronics-co-ltd/samsung-pay-framework/samsung-pay-framework-01-16-0002-android-apk-download/) and [Samsung Pay](http://www.apkmirror.com/apk/samsung-electronics-co-ltd/samsung-pay/samsung-pay-1-3-2116-android-apk-download/). The Samsung Pay app would load, but would fail to add any cards.I uninstalled the Samsung Pay app, but was *not* able to uninstall or disable the Samsung Pay Framework app. Looks like it was installed as a System app now.Fast forward to October 16th and the Samsung Pay app appears on the Play Store. I install it, but I get the error Failed to download latest version. Please try again later when downloading the (I forget the exact name) VerizonFramework for Samsung Pay.On October 19th, resetting the app and opening it again, it shows that it requires a system update, but none is available.On October 20th, Verizon releases a system update for the Note5, and I am able to download the necessary files to use Samsung Pay, and I added a card without a problem. Everything seems to work fine, but under Tap and Pay in the system settings, Android Pay is the only one that appears... no Samsung Pay. So when I use Samsung Pay, even though I set Tap and Pay to prioritize foreground applications, Android Pay instantly takes over the payment method which I speculate is due to no Samsung Pay presence in Tap and Pay, and possible the sideloaded framework from September.Hope this helps? Please let me know if I can clarify any further... I'd love to help!
The only thing that can scratch Gorilla glass 4 is minerals. Almost every metal is too soft to scratch the display. Just keep it away from rocks and it will not scratch. I had the Note 4 for over a year with no screen protector and theres not so much as a imperfection on the display. I got the note 5 recently and havent had one on the screen and its fine. I work at Sprint and put on screen protectors all day and people are amazed when I show them I never use one. I am very careful with my phone though. Most people are not tho. Especially if you work in a labor intensive field. 
Was definitely awesome when it full screen album and playback control on the lock screen. Feel like we went backwards on this one.
I signed up for the Samsung Pay on Dec. 6th.  I've been using it like crazy lately.  It's pretty nice although one day it kept trying to update the app while  checking out so I had to use my card.  I have not received the promotion code.. just the initial email saying that they were going to review my claim.  I have the right phone, bank, and have been using Samsung Pay.  I hope they send me the coupon code soon since it's only good through the 31st.  EEK!  
I'd take it to your service provider's store.  If it's not coming out easily they might be able to repair it.   Looks like it got screwed up with normal use so worst case scenario it'll be covered under samsung's warranty. 
This is the default for me. I enabled developer options and took a long screenshot of what's inside.
Same exact thing for me. I found out it was plastic as well and was wondering if anyone used those plastic scratch remover cream they sell for cars... 
Looks like a capture from the beggining of a 90's superhero movie :) Oh note 5 camera, shall i compare thee to summer's day, thou art more lovely and more temperate!
No, it is a little better because you don't have to wait for a carrier to mess around  with the update.
Take a look at Wally in the Google Play store.
I've been really good with my new note 5, I've never put it in my pocket with anything else and I've never dropped it.  However there are a few light scratches on my screen.  I have no idea how but I have to agree that it seems like the screen scratches extremely easily.
I've used the Anker brand charger on my Note for the past 2 months and haven't had any issues.  It quick charges without any issues.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014F3D8FQ?keywords=anker%20quick%20charge%202.0&ampqid=1449679767&ampref_=sr_1_1&ampsr=8-1
Textra worked really well for me on Note 4. Group chats were fine, nothing messed up.   Kind of funny, only reason I switched to Textra on Note 4 was because stock client always added Subject - No Subject in every message, and it pissed me off. Note 5 stock app does not do it and it's wonderful.  Please do keep in mind, I believe in Textra, you need to enable option for group text.
I just checked and there is an update for Verizon, I'm downloading as I type this
I got mine this week and apart from the battery I've had no problems. It's my first android so, to be fair, might just be me expecting more. Love it, though
Not sure it's a bug, as there are settings you can turn off to kill the issue. https://youtu.be/M14CWF5gnT8.Is this not this issue, or is it something else. 
For the longest time I couldn't even press Start and log in to my Samsung Account... Turned out that if you visit the Samsung Account portal on a separate web browser, you can turn off the activation lock, allowing you to proceed forward.Hope this helps someone in the future!
I was told that a AT&ampT phone can't use the LTE network on T-Mobile by a rep. This was back when the S3 was the big new phone so it may have changed. Supposedly the band T-Mobile uses isn't compatible with AT&ampT. 
Try building it from the bottom up, if you try to put one underneath it makes the folder. Also, make your icons bigger and remove the text. I used go launcher instead of Nova but nova should work too. Don't worry about copying, we all have to get inspiration from somewhere! Hopefully you get it to work 
What settings / options did u configure?I got google maps location disabled, a dark theme like yours, got package disabler pro and disabled most bloatware. I only get 4-4.5H Sot.
I'm not completely knocking on PDP, but in this post he basically disabled everything. Sure, you could do the same, but why did you but a Note 5 if you're going to disable almost all the features? If you wanted a large phone without any of their add ons, should have just bought a Nexus. 
Put it in a case with a glass screen protector.
If you're switching from an iPhone you get the bundle and an additional $10Google Play store credit. It'll ask you if you're switching from an iPhone but you can just choose no. 
Some Samsung devices have issues with 5ghz band wifi. Use [Wifi Analyzer] (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farproc.wifi.analyzer) to determine if you need to switch to the 2.4ghz band.
Thank you! Worked like a charm!I was running Lux Lite, just went into Settings, the Applications folder and Forced Stop it, went and retried it, worked!
Aukey, anker, or tronsmart, ideally look for 20awg cables 
Did you ever find a solution for this? I ended up cancelling my play music subscription because of this.
I have to imagine you're being hyperbolic, and don't truly believe that anyone is advocating losing all your functionality for SOT.  Nearly everything you mentioned is still very functional on my phone.  I did disable things like SmartStay ( I used it for about 5 minutes on the S4 back when it was introduced.  It's a gimmick feature.), and many other Samsung things like themes.  I prefer to use Nova over any other themer, so that is a personal preference.  All that said, I can still use my camera, I can still use the hand gesture for a selfie and all that.  I think it comes down to *knowing* what you're disabling rather than just going wild.  My S Pen works fine.  In fact I used it to take all those screenshots in the album.  My phone also doesn't turn off my wifi or alarm when the phone sleeps.  Basically what I'm trying to say, with the functions that I disabled, my phone acts in a *completely opposite* manner to what you're griping about.I think the problem with your PDP experience was a lack of knowledge about what you were disabling, and how it might affect your user experience.
Lol then Im sure that is an option but does it place a continuous speed indicator in the notification shade? That was the original request. There are plenty of speed test apps, heck you dont even need the app because the webpage works as well. 
I wouldn't use this for that. SpeedTest is a one time test to test your maximum speed. I'd use this to see when I'm using bandwidth. 2GB caps and shit.
Do you have a passcode?Does it show that the volume is being changes whilst on the lock screen?This is strange, because I cant also seem to get gestures and motions to work neither.
Testing now, standbyEdit1: Seurity policy update is needed to use Samsung Pay on this device.upon clicking update it hangs and eventually unfortunately, samsung pay has stopped workingdouble dang. 
Wow. Damn, it took a custom kernel, amplify, Greenify, powernap, turning off location and uninstalling facebook to even reach the 5-6 hour SOT range on my S5. The Note 5 seems too good to be true lol
Only the front is made of gorilla glass.
This. Add some music on your desktop, it syncs on the phone. It'll even upload your local media to add to a playlist and then sync that...
I don't think you'll be disappointed. Just make sure you thoroughly clean the phone before application. Don't want to get any dust under there.  I wore gloves and applied it in a steamy room (bathroom with shower on). 
Nice! I think my brightness was around 20% or something low. I keep it on auto but was in a pretty dim room. I was alternating between Reddit, Facebook, photo editor, and 3 different versions of Cut the Rope. (Mostly cut the rope, that game is stupidly addicting). I'm impressed it lasted so long with a game running!!
If you go to the samsung support website, on the top right corner click on the feedback and send them a feedback. I had the same issue and had to flash custom kernel to be able to use the phone. It would only get 2hrs of SOT and 10hrs of standby. By the way, if you don't want to root, then try to disable the android device manager and the location history. Also try to keep the wifi off and see if it makes any difference.
I figured out what it was and tested it with some other people. If you're having this issue, then I can almost guarantee that you have the latest updates installed for Facebook Messenger. Uninstall that app (or revert) and your problem will be solved. It was happening on my S6 Edge as well
I've been tinkering with Package Disabler Pro a lot over the past few weeks and for some reason it ended up being the cause of my battery drain.  After I re-enabled all packages I started getting way better battery life.  I'm thinking there's a bug with one of the packages I had disabled, which is almost certainly in that guys extreme xml file.  I actually had a fairly basic list of packages disabled too.
Yeah I swear by them at this point. I have the gold note 5 and I swear by the case since its relatively compact, seems to protect my phone well enough, and lets me keepbthe gold color in view

My five aren't great - these are just the first five things I did with mine.Install Nova LauncherCustomize notification tray shortcutsEdit quick settings optionsChange color mode to basic (scientifically researched to be the most color accurate - if you care, if you like things to just look 'bright' and 'colorful' and 'pretty', then go ahead and oversaturate that shit, it is all about what YOU like, but once you get used to basic, I think you'll appreciate it)I strongly recommend a case for this fucker. It's skinny and as slippery as a pelican's dick in an oil spill.

this has to be installed for the s note app.  it's funny that the others are recommending themes on a note phone.  and nobody is talking about the handwriting capabilities.  I also recommend microsoft onenote app.
Okay you have a Mac but you want to go stock, well beggars can't be choosers at this points.. Have you tried to to mount as mass storage and move a file over? I would just put another ROM on there.Also you were a little vague, did you by chance wipe system and internal storage?
I got a note 5 and was in same boat as you as both devices pretty much cost the same in Australia . I've come to love my note 5 due to better battery and the s-pen turned out to be damn useful which I didn't think would be at first.  TouchWiz is now scaled back and even allows for themes, the only downside seems to be the shitty multitasking but I heard that the nexus 6 also suffers from it(not 6p)The camera app on the note 5 shits over the nexus 6p and it only takes a second to load up using double tap of home button, I found I use it a great deal more than my nexus 5 due to that one feature.Go to YouTube and search up things like note 5 tips as it will show you what the note can do,  them videos made me fall in love with my Note as I was very unhappy due to all the nexus 6p hyper but now I know I made the right choice for me. If you ain't into flashing and want a productivity device you can't beat a note 5 , but if you want cutting edge software (with bugs) and flashing then get Nexus 6p. Myself I already flashed a new kernel (arty97) and loving it. 
Im running rooted stock with skyhigh kernel. No custom rom yet as i can accomplish everything i need with xposed modules. Skyhigh is great, tons of customization options. Rooted with odin... amazingly easy. 
You can also drag your hand (pinky side), either way across the screen. Kinda hard to explain the gesture, you can search for gestures in settings and find it
How in the world do you have so much battery?
I use no lock screen. Maybe that's the problem. I'll change it to swipe like you said.
Yeah, and it would scratch and be shitty. And then people wouldn't buy it for as much and you'd be looking at a much smaller margin than if you just bought panels from OEMs and scraped the color off. 
Yeah I disabled plenty. Not sure why my battery seems to still suck though lol I'll have to post a battery monitor tomorrow 
&gt I send a text message and it goes down 1% each time yeaaaaaaaaaaa...that's not supposed to happen 
Same thing happened when verizon was blocking the Google Wallet app a few years ago. This could just be more network fuckerey 
1. I havent found a way to get by this I also would like to know how you can get the save button to stay gone.. You'd think they offer an option where save can only be pressed by the finger but is otherwise unrecognized by the pen.Edit: I was drunk
Oh well. No root, delayed Samsung pay. Im super glad I didn't sign a contract 
I used the usb cable from my s4 and that hasn't made a difference. Can it be the block. Also I seem to be having battery issues (really long charge time). I've had the phone for a month and it was good in the beginning but now it has issues. 
Do you have a different launcher?  Different theme?  You can't expect a single screenshot and us to just know of the billion of android apps, which one looks like this.
Thanks, but there's nothing there as well. I think I clicked every single option available in the phone and found nothing.The craziest thing is that I was able to edit this once (before purchasing). Not sure if an update messed up with this or what, but I just can't find the options to edit this anywhere.
I don't think it's a good idea to demonstrate your screen protector and the case by dropping a $80all glass phone.  The more you drop it the higher the chances that at some point it will start breaking. 
Is there a tempered glass screen protector for the Note 5 without a halo effect yet?I got my Note 5 within the first week and didn't order one since every single one had mixed reviews of the halo effect happening.. 
Works for me. You have to start the swipe from the bottom and swipe up at least half way up the screen and it will work consistently. BTW, did you install the new update from today 11/11?
Do you know what percentage the phone was at when you put it on the charger? I believe the fast charge only works if the phone is like 60% or lower and switches to a regular charge above that. I'm not sure on the exact percentages though.

I would troubleshoot your phone a little more. Maybe it's the router? If it is, in fact, your phone, I'd just have them fix it. I don't think wifi alone is worth rooting. At least not this early on. 
Free ram is wsdted ram. What's the point in clearing ram all the time? It just makes your apps have to reload data all the time. ..
Yes, and motorola turbo Charger is also a quick charger and it works with the Note 5 also
I got the black and love how it changes to a metallic blue in the light... subtle but beautiful.  Adds a real depth to the design.
&gtObviously I may overuse the S Pen because of the doodling habits and I may encounter any of the common problems I read here really soon.You get 7 replacement nibs, and each will last you a good few months you also get a tool to easily replace the nibs. So don't worry about that.As for inserting it the wrong way, that is not a dealbreaker at all. Kind of non-idiotproof design yes, but just... don't put it in that way.The clicking mechanism is kind of fun to play around with, and it's high enough quality that it hasn't broken in my months of angrily playing around with it, so not a problem here either.There's a feature that nags you to put the S Pen back in if you haven't used it in a while, so I recommend keeping that turned on it'll save your S Pen from getting lost quite a bit if you're bad at that sort of thing.The Note5 is a great phone and I couldn't recommend it enough. Except for the backward insertion, the S Pen is a solid component too, and even with that exception, you can just avoid putting it in that way.  I hope this helped. Cheers! :)
Samsung netflix what?
Stock TW, because I'm a terrible person. Mostly only use it because it's really easy to set the home screen, app drawer, and lock screen to one background (all black) in one step. I'm a little obsessive about everything being black to save battery.
You may have a defective device. My display looks gorgeous at any angle
Thanks for the replies! I'm looking at the 64GB version myself. Right now my 16GB iPhone 5S is...well obviously it's not a lot of storage. But even now, I just delete photos and video practically immediately since everything goes to my Google Photos. It's annoying but I'm not too concerned about not having a swappable SD card.
I have the same issue with wlan_rx_wake. Keeps waking up the phone. Skyhigh kernel, had the same issue on arter kernel tooBattery on 4g is very good though since wlan isn't waking it up. To achieve this I froze certain things in the guide above using titanium backup. But it doesn't fix this annoying wifi problem
Was this for the same phone as the one you got your free wireless chargers for?
only tip I have (besides watch the video) is to download the optional packages - extensions, easy chart, idea sketch, s note widget.No it doesn't bother me - prefer to have a better way to enter notes via S Notes. 
I went into the app manager and uninstalled the Facebook update. Logged back into FB and it was an option again. After the contacts synced, I just updated it again in the play store.
[](http://imgur.com/OLk03t3)Been using DashClock since the days of Jelly Bean. Launcher = Nova Launcher 
Hahaha I don't. That's just a picture I found online to use as an example.
Thanks for that app, ice missed the always on buttons 
That's what I did. I used recent apps as a reference to see what was open. The one time I did that nothing happened. After a reboot and it started happening again I just hit recent apps and close all and it started working again. 
The point being is that why not give screen on time in a worse case scenario instead of a perfect scenario. You know what I want to know about a phone, how well it will do with all the features turned off that make it a smart phone, brightness at 15% 3 feet from the router with everything that could sync turned off..Yes that makes so much more sense doesn't it. Ya know if these companies took a worse case scenario approach to stating endurance then we would have a more realistic idea of what the devices are capable of. Or you could just be a dick. That works too. Appreciate the lesson in __shit everyone already knows__ also.   
If you're a holster dweeb like me, I'd recommend my current case:  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B012S5S6BY/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_QnrxwbZ8JRGPG If you were to get a case like this or a similar one I would put a tempered glass screen protector on, as it doesn't have a built in front cover.You could also look for something like a flip cover or wallet case to get full protection from the front.If none of these look good and you're used to an otterbox then it might be worth it to pay the extra $ and just go for it. To be honest, unless you're really getting a ton of dirt it shouldn't be too big of an issue, and it will also be helpful to have the home button accessible to be able to use the fingerprint ID.
You got me thinking as I was planning on buying the Note 5 outright from Bell (aka Hell)  however I could take a drive to the Samsung store in Markham? And buy it there with no carrier lock. 
It's busy as fuck, but if you want all that information then you've done a great job of putting it at your fingertips.
Using your finger versus the pen uses 2 different technologies. You may have a bad digitizer, which is why one would work over the other.If a factory reset doesn't fixnjt, you may need the to get the phone replaced 
I get just under or over 6 hours and im a pretty heavy user. I try to keep the screen on auto. It looks bad compared to full brightness at first, but you totally get used to it. Also moving in and out of WiFi zones will hurt it. Good to turn it off unless you are using it, but sometimes i will forget and run out of data, and i have 1gigs.So impressed compared to me g3. Didnt get 4 hours from the same size battery.
Lots of posts about this but it's the cable that comes with the phone. It gets pretty hot and is inconsistent so I recommend replacing it. I use a note 4 cable that I had and it works much better.
Damn man thats fricken awesome so jealous :( I top off at around 5 hours while using PDP so I'm guessing I get the extra 2 hours from using airplane mode? Did you auto disable the bloatwares? Anything in particular you think really helped? Thanks :)
Immediate fix.  Different USB cable I had around the house - nicer, woven one that we've had for awhile.  Works great now.  It's def the USB cable.  Now I feel dumb plugging it in and out a hundred times :/
Just place your phone on top of the built in wireless charging area on the tables. Most Starbucks have them. It's supports it natively without the need for anything extra.Apparently our phones comes with both QI and PMA (Powermat) built-in.
Yes, but keep in mind that if you disable *anything* with PD then you won't be able to take an OTA update unless you re-enable it all. Not a deal breaker but an inconvenience everyone should be aware of. I personally have only disabled 2 or 3 things and it seems to be enough. 
Just ordered the Jtech screen  protector and the spigen neo hybrid crystal case  !
It should automatically do that when I connect Bluetooth to my car. Shouldn't stop my music play a dumb tone and then continue. Pretty annoying
Doesn't remove. Only disables. Also, package disabler may not work on a rooted phone.
Ah yes, while I don't blame you for thinking I'm some dipshit who wanted to click a do it for me button, since the internet is just riddled with those people, you're mistaken. I used a couple XML files I found on some popular forums, but I perused them to make sure I could still use the apps I use like Facebook and it's veritable *herd* of accessory apps that you have to download if you have a business page on there. My battery is fine with ~20packages disabled but I'm at about a bare minimum for why I bought the device anyway. I wanted a feature rich powerhouse for lack of a better term, and I got one, but even after disabling most of Samsungs bullshit and 110% of Verizon's redundant and unnecessary suite, I'm running at like 3 hours SoT with ~16 hours overall. It's not awful. It could be better.  Maybe it's the pride, but you guys seriously respond with this snooty berating bullshit without even realizing that you're saying yeah sure it takes a couple hours and research but if you know exactly what you're doing you can maintain 90% functionality while extending your battery!The thing is, you can do this with almost anything. Spend enough time fucking around with cars and you can increase your mileage, learn how to overclock, suddenly you can make your computer sprint around game engines like some kind of technomancer! I'm not denying that the phone, in capable hands, can be rectified to function like everyone feels it should in the first place. I'm saying it's bullshit that you guys do it and tell anyone who has trouble with the process that they must have no idea what you're doing, you fucking idiot.Also, my WiFi literally never turns off, so turns out I was mistaken about that, after all. Not a single setting or off switch in PDP has been able to stifle my WiFi being on 100% of the time my phone is powered on, and cell standby chewing my battery life to death.  
Just a side question OP, how did you manage a screen capture for the full web page?
Just tried it on mine and it does it at this extreme angle, though it seems less noticible than your photo.The angle is far beyond anything I'd even attempt to read the phone at.
Dragging your finger diagonally across the screen from an upper corner activates pop-up mode in supported apps. It sounds like this is what you're describing. I'm not sure if you can turn it off but at least now you can Google it.
I have my library on Google music but the streaming in my area is pretty bad so it's not a solution. I have an OTG cable with my SD card plugged in  
Just did this deal. I leased for $3a month with sprint. I used the gift card for a case and screen protector
Can I ask how often you're adjusting your phone ? I leave location, Bluetooth, and WiFi on at all times and the phone will get me through 16 hours a day with 2 hours of battery life. I'm also in Verizon. It's really annoying considering I've seen the same settings on other Notes and they see 4 hours of on screen time as well. Also, Nova shouldn't be an issue either, right? Thanks! 
Is 60fps supported on Android? I can't really tell and it doesn't say when selecting the quality. I'm on the Note 5 as well.
I would either delete Android Pay and reinstall it, or reset the device completely. I had to factory reset because sideloading caused me issues on my S6 Edge.
* 1 - you retain all of the mentioned functionality* 2 - Long time Nexus/AOSP user here, and I hated Touchwiz enough to return my buggy Galaxy S6s, but I'm making due with the Note 5.  Currently have Nova + a material theme going, but I REALLY miss some of the little things, like Google's dialer &amp contacts.  * 3 - Couldn't answer for you, I'm sorry.                                Honestly, this is my opinion:  If you can buy the phone outright, get the Nexus 6P as it's $300+ less, and you get just as much functionality with it.   If you're on AT&ampT or Verizon?  Get the Nexus 6P just because their Note5 can't even be rooted.  If you're on T-Mobile, it's a tossup, but I'd side towards the 6P.  RUMOR has it that T-Mobile will be carrying the Nexus in 6 months (I won't believe it till they officially announce it), and at that point, I'd use my Jump on Demand lease to hop right into the 6P AND lower my monthly payment.Finally, if you're on Sprint...  Why?  :)
I'm guessing that means it was a paid app at one point?
I bought a 2tb MyCloud for about $150, it's pretty damn cool. You just hook it up to your router and it acts like cloud storage so you can access the stuff on it from anywhere. 
I think buzz launcher and atom launcher are rly nice cause you can customize these launchers very easy and there are a lots of themes which you can download
A resizable widget on the home screen.
I love my Speck Candyshell. Good protection, not too big, and I absolutely love the grip on the back and sides. 
I combined 2 photos with Pixlr. Let me see if I can upload it
Are you using Odin? Put the phone in download mode, open Odin and plug the phone in. Odin should see it. Just make sure you have the stock ROM ready to load. 
That doesn't seem right. I'm getting at most 4% drain and that's with location high accuracy and advanced calling on. 
Great question. I'd recommend our PowerCore+ 1005for two reasons:(1) It's got Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0(2) It's the most compact 10000mAh portable charger with QC 2.on the market.
Additional question.  For the Level on holiday bundle, do I have to have Samsung Pay activated with a valid card?  I didn't see anything mentioned about Samsung pay for this specific promo but I'm stuck at validating.  I submitted a claim on 11/2and I know others that submitted a claim on the same day that were approved weeks ago and already received this bundle.
Nexus 5 is LG made but it is mhl. As far as I can tell the note 5 doesn't have mhl. 
can you add a screen shot of your screen brightness setting?
wow, lucky you guys, I take mine off the charger around 8am and by 11pm with maybe and hour and half to 2 hours of SOT i am at 15-30%
A few possibilities:1. You have kies installed. Fix: download and run the uninstaller2. your carrier's default USB setting is as an installation device rather than file transfer. Fix: select USB options to change this setting while the phone is plugged in.3. your USB cable is a crappy 3rd party charging cable. Fix: Get a better USB cable that's capable of data transfer.4. you disabled a package that file transfer depends on. Fix: reenable all packages (Export an XML so you can disable those specific packages again afterwards)
Ah, in that case solutions look a bit limited. For example, a launcher like Nova could hide the status bar altogether on your home screens, but would come back I think on other screens? Getting all this from a similar request on the [Android Central forums](http://forums.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-note-4/481659-can-i-get-rid-status-icons-notification-bar.html)
Please make sure you record videos in a horizontal/landscape fashion. 
When i use one it's nova, but im actually ok with touchwiz this time around so i havent used nova yet
There is a paid app called light flow, it has a free version as well but if I'm thinking correctly this is an option in this app and you can even choose individual apps that do or do not light the screen.. If it doesn't work you can refund the app,, one of my favorite parts of the play store. 
Hmm, I don't seem to have that option setting on my phone (I'm in Australia so that might explain it). I've also got the smart network switched off.I might try the router reset idea that someone else suggested.Thanks for the help guys
I was curious as to how much power a solar panel that size could generate, so I calculated it. The note 5 is 6 x 3 in or 0.125 ft^2. A good solar panel can generate 2watts/ft^2, so if the entire back was a solar panel and in good sunlight it would generate 2.5 watts.  At this rate it would take ~6 hours to fully charge a note 5. So not was fast as a wall charger, but it could be enough to keep the phone passively charged if you just left it gave down in the sun when not in use. 
I'm not sure if this is the answer you're looking for, but sometimes it takes time for the phone to realize it's fast charging. So before it realizes that it is fast charging, it will just say cable charging. 
I think there was an exynos model and a model with an SD.  From what I read development for the S6 started, but was abandoned because the source code for the exynos processors is not freely available. 
Yeah, it's always there. But losing screen real estate in my notification bar is a small price to pay for an extra couple hours of usage time.Besides, plenty of things take up space in the [notification bar](http://imgur.com/WQboXXN.jpg)
Tips get worn out with use. The grey ones are hard plastic, while the black ones are rubber. They provide different feedback when writing.
I did the most recent Verizon update and mine still seems to charge at the same rate as before with waze on and my generic car 12v to usb 5v, not sure on amperage but probably 2.1. 
I don't see any update. Is this old when did days ago? 
Just found a fix for this or at least it worked for me.  Go to settings &gt battery.  Check and see if it says immediately on Power Saving Mode.  If it does, turn on Power Saving Mode and then click thd box and change it from immediately to one of the other settings.  It should fix your issue.
off screen memo has no any option like MORE. So it is best to take the notes direct from the snote widget wnd then click the MORE option.
I read the negative feedback on the Note 5 having no SD slot or removable battery, but when I thought about it, out of all the phones I've owned, I never had a real need for a removable battery or SD slot. I used the standard SD and battery throughout the life of the phone. Also, I will have moved on to another phone before I start worrying about needing more than 32gb storage or the battery burning out. 
That's it! People don't do it. I do, so my fingerprint is always recognized. You have to teach it different angles.

Battery consumption actually isn't linear. The first 10% drains far more slowly than the next 30% that drains more slowly than the battery leftover after that. 
NFC icon. It's what things like Samsung Pay use. You can turn it off in the settings to make it go away, but then it's off. I used to be able to hide things like that with root. But I'm on a Verizon note so I'm locked down. 
I use mine a lot. Especially for Netflix, YouTube, and casting my screen to show photos to family. Plus, I paid it $40, but got $2of Google Play credit along with it, in addition too two free movie rentals ($5 worth each) and offers like 3 months of Google Play Music Unlimited ($1per month) and 3 months of Spotify Premium ($1per month). Basically, the Chromecast paid for itself.
It's not meant to be dropped , if it happens then it happens! Just get a case or keep it naked or maybe go with another phone ? BTW the glass back distributes the heat in a much better way than the metal ones.
Does it have Samsung Pay? Does it have an S-Pen? Then no
Running power saving mode?? With it on the lights turn out. 
Talks about the note 5, but uses a picture of the original note. It's killer features are the screen, which is the same as that of all galaxy S6 variants, the specs the same and the looks, which okay, I'll give it. Shittest of shit posts 
When your phone is connected, do you pull down the notification panal and switch the usb settings to allow the computer to recognize your phone? 
You have a note 5?  Just take a picture in raw format with the camera in the phone
Never used the function so it meant nothing to me. But being able to do everything else once again after I thought my S-Pen was disabled forever was an amazing feeling.And no, everything won't work immediately after breaking the sensor. You have to make sure you change the settings. For people who don't know that (like me 12 horus ago) you're going to assume you're shit out of luck.
Turn off simple pay in settings.
Seems silly when you can just plug in the cable but it is really handy especially like on your dresser or desk at work I love mine and would say get that.
Looks like you may be right. Samsung support had me run my phone in safe mode for a few hours to see if the issues comes back. It happened in safe mode so I disabled each app (which also removes updates) and it started working again once I disabled FB messenger.
That's far more minimal than I would've imagined. Looks cleaner and far more organized than stock. I'm already sold and currently looking into the differences between carriers. I've found some info for a t-mobile version but nothing on AT&ampT yet. I also read something a few days ago that mentioned a requirement is that the device has to be unlocked(though that may have been related to cyanogenmod... before I realized it isn't an option at the moment). Is this referring to unlocking from the carrier or simply having the screen unlocked? If it refers to the carrier could you recommend software to handle that? I mean if you already know. I wouldn't expect you to do my research for me. 
&gt Silly mistake here... of course it works fine. i had to pull the Note 5 SPen out first in order to be able to use the old Galaxy Note 10.1 S-Pen.
I feel ya. For some reason today my battery was abysmal. Couldn't even get to 12 hours before the phone was under 15%!I took some screenshots so you can see what my stats look like: http://imgur.com/a/jsDTMI'm unrooted on Telus.
That is true, but I still think that is a bum deal, because I am not getting any more value vs. just buying it off contract. 
I just ordered a Silver and hope to receive it soon!! So excited. Thanks for asking this question.
Ended up finding pushbullet and it works but the side sync looks way cooler. 
Been happening to me on and off since the last update
Best practice is to reboot after a Samsung Pay update. It's been working fine for me since the 11/11update. 
im only really concerned about the battery. I love how long the Note4 battery is lasting me. My friend told me if anything just bring it to a samsung repair shop a few days before warranty expires or if the battery is going bad to get a replacement.Slippery back doesn't really affect me, cause I'm going to be putting a case on it right away, and I dont need the extra storage
CM as in cyanogenmod?  I thought they didn't support the Note 5.
I think I could get to [7h sot](http://imgur.com/YnzH93e).  This is also [over 24hrs](http://imgur.com/WX200mP).  Mostly using flow browsing reddit.  5 or 6 short calls, 20ish texts.   Mostly on wifi.  Played with the camera a bit too. Using the darkness theme.   Haven't fully disabled bloat yet or used that app you mentioned in your comment.  
I've noticed this, too. If I reboot it will fast charge, but later on in the day if I charge it reverts back to normal charging and I have to reboot again.
Is cinema better or basic?
Picture #3. The OCD in me is triggered by your stylus. Why is it not flush? Is the slot damaged in some way? 
Done! Great voice for YouTube channel. Comforting. 
I know when I had the note 3 I really didn't care for the spen. I couldn't seems to integrate it in to my use of the phone. Now with the note 5 I use it daily and I'm starting to teach myself how to draw. 
I've had the Indian edition in platinum gold and I have no idea why this has not come out in all countries yet. The most premium looking colour IMO.
I got invalid emails from 3 promotions. The gift holidays were first, but I did email them using the form they provided. I just said it's the correct IMEI*,  did they want me to take a screen shot of the box.I got a email earlier today from the support team,  probably a week after I replied saying that my IMEI is in their system and I'll get my stuff in 6 weeks. So wait for a reply email! Edit: Meant IMEI not email.
I would say its the same material as older cases they have had.  I had a Note 2 and it def feels the same.

How do you check the screen on time? 
Today it prompted me to be able to just swipe to unlock when I'm at home. I use fingerprint but this is pretty cool too. 
The heart rate sensor on the Note 5 isn't available to any third-party app yet. It's a bummer. I'd want to use Google Fit with it.
I don't think it's as useful as we think tbh.  It simply overlays black on pixels, it does not change the render beneath.  I would think simply turning down brightness and using dark mode in apps that support it would be more effective.
Pfff, no fast wireless charging, no buy...It looks nice, though.
Let us know how the case works with the wrap, that's sounds like an awesome idea.
No NFC does not have to be turned on for fast charging. I got [this](http://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Charger-Spigen%C2%AE-Charging-Premium/dp/B00UGIA0WY/). Although not a fast charger, it charges 100% without issues.edit: wording
My tech 21 case is thin.  The majority of its but is around the edges. Very thin in back. Would recommend. 
What do you recommend as a cable that will fast charge? I got this phone for christmas 
I'm no expert but I'm pretty sure that won't hurt your phone at all. I remember that used the recommended way to do it because charging too early would hurt the battery. That's not the case anymore but yeah it probly fine
News+ if you need an RSS reader.            Zooper widget pro to customize your home screens.              Pocketcast for podcasts.               Fenix for Twitter.               
Best thing about the international model, it doesn't come with alot of bloatware. Just took me about 2 mins to disable the Samsung ones I have no use for and its basically vanilla touchwiz lool
Getting this too.... But I'm not sure how relevant any of it is. I've only had it on a few ROMs, right now I have the problem on the T Mobile Note 5 Texxodus ROM. With Arter's kernel. I have it on and off depending on the ROM. I wish I knew what caused it. Pretty much ruins themes on those ROMs if I don't lock portrait. :&lt
Dang! I can't get one because my wife and I both have chase cards, and chase doesn't do samsung pay. 
Still nothing about disabling this? I'm so annoyed getting this notification every day. I'm sick of it.
Loving it due to s-pen and ultra fast camera launch time,  I find I use it for everything now, like taking pics of receipts and places and things I need to remember n using it later to import into google goggles or Evernote. I also brought a Seagate wireless 1tb pro as the note don't have external SD..  Don't ever buy the wireless sandisk USB sticks,l or the Samsung wireless drive.. They don't work well and have a crap load of connection issues. If I was you I'd play with one first, going over to android will be a system shock
Can a company just declare that parts of their product are no longer under warranty?
I've had the 2, 4 and now the 5. The constant stuttering and frame rate issues on the Note 4 were annoying. This is almost nonexistent on the 5. It's a much smoother experience. I'm getting better battery life now as well. The only thing I miss is the IR blaster. I never used the SD card slot and never swapped the battery.If you like to keep devices longer than 2 years I would stay away from the 5, though. The battery life will eventually decline and there won't be an easy way to replace it. 
I use Package Disabler Pro to shut off most of the programs I don't use.Samsung Pay doesn't really exist in Canada yet, so you may as well wait till they offer a nice freebie for signing up.I like the colour scheme - but I use a case. The Spigen Slim Armor is very durable and doesn't add a ton to the bulk. It's already proven its worth to me as I'm pretty clumsy first thing in the morning.
I just wish my nexus phone had the magnetic strip technology that my note 5 had. It really is a cool tech and a great way to get this sort of thing mainstream. I sold the note 5, its just not as snappy with touchwiz and all.
Try assigning another fingerprint to the same finger as you use. The more=the better it will work.
Thanks for all the advice! I'll be taking a look more into these.  I turned off google location services, and turned off automatic updates from the play store so I can control it.  Although it makes me sad that my photos won't be geotagged anymore because of it.I'm a bit confused about the other two.  In general, I thought leaving WiFi on was preferable to the cell network to save battery, and I thought turning off WiFi location would mean google would rely on GPS to get location.I actually only lost 7% of my battery in 7 hours of sleep (ironically, the Reddit app took 1% of that), so the idle drain is good.  My network idle is also low on my stats for battery drain.I'm guessing that leaves me with package disabler to keep rooting out offenders.   I'll play around a bit here and there I really don't want to disable services.Thanks again!
Piggybacking in this thread- is there a way to remove the icon from the status bar?  I always keep it on anyways, I don't need to see the icon on there...it's just clutter.
I'm happy with mine.  I wasn't even going to get a note 5 reading all the bad things about it but I'm glad I did.  Screen is gorgeous, battery life is great, performance is great... phone is cool all the time, no random heating up like my note 3.
The Nexus 6P has a 5.7in screen, fingerprint sensor and type c so you may want to check that out.
Can't say I have a fix, but I've noticed it recently- it didn't happen before. Last night even WiFi stopped until I rebooted.
I just got the Leather cover today and it looks freaking amazing! Defo get that as a replacement if you are looking for one. Otherwise I would look into getting the Keyboard cover cuz it just looks kick ass :D
I second this - got it for my S5 and now that I'm on Note5 I just went back to it after trying Google Now Launcher. Lot of customization and pretty smooth. Offers the option to have looping homescreen on or off.
You probably have the assisted dialing turned on. It in phone &gt More &gt Settings &gt other call settings
Brightness should be on default settings, not sure since i never messed with it.That screenshot i did of my home screen is basiclly identical to how it looks when i look at my phone, so i guess brightness is on nromal.
T Mobile. I disable Volte and WiFi calling. My cell standby stopped draining my battery.
Besides the alignment issues, what are your overall thoughts on iOttie? Build quality good/bad? How did you mount it in your car? Did you use the glue plate mount or did you order the optional sticky mount?  I've been looking at it since I picked up my Note5Thanks!
If you use poweramp as a music player there's an option to have it fullscreen
I have mine set on power save mode and the keys stay off, maybe not the answer you're looking for but it works I guess.
I have a note sync into my default folder in ever note then I organized things via ever note
More photos please!  Thinking of getting some myself. 
What is that weather widget?
I read on a forum for android that on first charge you can do that. The old style batteries used to need some 8 hour charge. It changed now but I dint see harm in leaving it an extra 3mins. BTW again that is first charge only.
I'm looking for this as well...Coming from a rooted OPO, loved the album cover on the lockscreen. Hope someone finds a solution that doesn't involve rooting.
But my thought is, something like that should never be suggested as a correction in the first place. The auto correct on the note is much more aggressive than I've experienced on any of my phones in the past, which led to a lot of unwanted accepted corrections when I first started using it. I've deleted suggestions like this as I've caught them, but a lot of times I just don't catch it until I've already accepted the correction. 
Thanks for your help. Brought the charger to verizon after talking to their customer service and they took the charger back. They gave me one of their store brand chargers and it works fine. They told me they don't know when the issue will be fixed but they are well aware of it. As for the battery draining fast, I'm SOL. I was looking at the usage and it seems all of the apps that come on the phone burn a lot so I'm going to disable or delete them.

I actually just tried my old note 4 charger and its charging now. This one is all beat up and wire hanging out. Early I was using one of my new note 4 charger and the note 5 charger and neither were working correctly. By the All of them are official samsung chargers. Is there anyway to test the battery or something to see what happened or what's going on?
Oh got you. As far as SoT goes, I get roughly the same then. Always at least 4hours though. Mine is roughly 2-2.5HR to 50% battery. The only power saving feature I'm using is auto brightness but unfortunately I think that average is about as good as you can hope for with a screen that bright and high res.
So, you know AT&ampT has added protection on their version (and Verizon's) that refuses to let the device boot if you try to root it, right?  Just saying, I'm not trying to discourage you from trying, but if you're new to this, realize that people WAY more experienced have been trying since release, and none can get any progress.
It force stops apps that run in the backgrouns when you are done using them. It helps to save battery!
S-View all the way
My only problem with the Note 5 is now I only have *some* of my music on it, compared to my S3 which had *all* of my music on it. Battery is pretty good. I don't get why people are complaining so much. Are they complaining about the battery itself or the fact that you can't remove it?
I can attest it's the cable. I also got a Note 4 charger an Amazon. Haven't had a problem since.
That's possible but not in my case , you need packge disabler when you do a lot of gaming and full HD YouTube videos.
I mean it is though. When like every other day someone posts asking about the battery, there's a problem with the battery. It's not anecdotal at this point. Mine seems to have settled, mostly, after endless tweaking and package disabling and changing my habits. And even now, sometimes it's shitty. 
don't give up hope, this just got posted!! I already signed up *fingers crossed*http://slickdeals.net/f/8189225-free-wireless-charger-samsungrpomotions-must-have-purchased-galaxy-s6-s6-edge-s6-edge-or-note-5
I am entitled to express my frustration. That's why we have these forums. And I think you took it more seriously than I meant it. Don't try to read tone from a few lines on reddit. And you assume that I haven't submitted feedback, why? Your comment is unhelpful and critiquing my opinion only serves to create a negative environment. Maybe you should have asked if I had submitted feedback instead. That would generate a thoughtful dialogue rather than this unnecessary back and forth where we are now off topic.
I've never seen one. There were quite a few cases I tried and this was an issue on most. Only case I liked that I could easily get the pen out was the otterbox defender. Though I didn't try the commuter which wouldn't be as bulky but I assume the hole to get the pen out would be similar. 
What's your posture for holding the pen and phone?
Similar to others here im averaging 5-6 hours of SoT.  Its not spectacular but its solid and gets me through the day with heavy use.  The real difference though is that I can throw it on the charger for 15 mins and get like 20-30% charge.  Also it charges up relatively quickly even while playing games while charging.
Sound I think is a little high, but that's just me. Sorry, I don't like phones with their speakers on the bottom. When I'm holding them and blocking the speaker, then it's a 1/1for sound. But as for general, I'll say that the speaker really disappoints me with this phone. Display is only 9 out of 10? What would make it a 1for you?  What phone would you give a 1to? Also, what would make the camera a 1for you? Not really arguing this one as it seems people have different tastes in cameras, so this is more curiosity than anything. 
Eh, maybe. According to OP, you have to use a heat gun to remove the back at all. Making it clear sounds easy just remove the sticker from the glass with a razor. So buying a clear back on eBay wouldn't really make this easy.
I'll make sure to consult you before setting any prices. 
I had a Note 2 and I was going to get the Note 4, but I opted for the Note 5The main cons on the Note 5 are Battery (which I have never changed my battery on my Note 2, or any phone for that matter), SD slot (I had 32GB in my Note 2 so I just got a 64GB Note 5). I wanted the IR slot, but my Tablet has it and I hardly - if ever - use it. As for longevity comparing the 2. My wife has had the Note 4 since release and it's still going strong. I had my Note 2 for nearly 3 years now and it really is going strong as well. A little dated obviously, but a new battery will probably fix it's sluggishness. I had my Note 5 for 2 weeks and when people say this phone is slippery... LISTEN. It's slightly smaller than my Note 2 in actual dimensions. I was sitting on the garage floor doing some work and my Note 5 slid out of my pocket. It was only a mere 3-4 inches and my screen is shattered. Not like run over by a car and smashed on the ground but there are 4 long cracks width wise along the middle to top, and the upper right corner has a wicked lightning like shape on the screen.As far as battery on the Note 5, it has Ultra Power Saving Mode. It basically turns everything into black and white and severely limits what you can do. However, you're still able to make calls and get text messages. You just can't surf the internet and watch movies. It's a fair compromise to me, because I'm never really far from a plug. 
No, its not a speed test, rather a speed indicator. 
I use textra for texting. Used to be free but now its like a buck or something. Trying staying with stock messenger a few times but always went back to textra. It is the fastest and smoothest texting app by far. Baconreader for Reddit. I used relay for Reddit for a while but went back to baconreader because its much cleaner. Camscanner is something I use very often. Take pics and convert to PDF. I even use it to fax with my ringcentral. I think it's free. Google photos is awesome. Backs up all your photos for free in high quality but if you want full quality it'll cost you extra. I like Google keyboard. Much smoother and better keyboard than Samsung in my opinion. Better autocorrect and voice to text than Samsung's keyboard.Onenote and onedrive are awesome if you use the services. I have all my stuff synced everywhere. (Google has the same things called Google keep and google drive, but I got a promotional 20gigs of onedrive so it works better for me.)
Press and hold the Home button and it's done in like a second. 
Not getting vibration feedback either even though it turned on.
Unfortunately my router only has 2.4Ghz ..The option you talked about is in S6 but not in note 5, looked up the entire phone
on the screen? or the bezel? the bezel/sides seems to be easily scratched. more concern about the screen though cause the tempered glass i'm using sucks
http://i.imgur.com/UwsBxrR.pngHere is what I see. I have an international unlocked version. Can I see a screenshot of what you see?
Although I will not discredit this... this doesn't answer the question as to why one of my two Note 5s has an issue while the other is fine. Same cable, same wall adapter and same wireless pad.
that's what thought too until you get relay and find that it has some sort of embedded imgur viewer to view images and gifs without having to open it inside the in-app browser. Small features like that (including loads more) makes it just better than the rest especially in design (Material design is gorgeous)
Where did you find a custom ROM for the Note5, if I may ask? Google searches arent bringing anything up.
[JayBird BlueBuds X](http://www.amazon.com/JayBird-BlueBuds-Sport-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B00AIRUOI8)They released the second version, but honestly, these are great.[OTG Cable](http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0081CRXGI/ref=mp_s_a_1_7?qid=1444741645&ampsr=8-7&amppi=AC_SX110_SY165_QL70&ampkeywords=otg+cable&ampdpPl=1&ampdpID=21Y5cBAp6BL&ampref=plSrch) or On The Go cable.

Jump has insurance. Jump on demand is different, its only available for a few high end phones but is free, whereas regular jump is $10/mo
You can read all about it on r/Android. They have new rules regarding the masking of battery drain and permissions on 3rd party software that isn't a direct replacement of a core android functionality. So basically, all the crap that Samsung crams into Android System might be problematic for these new rules. Only time will tell how much they'll be able to get away with.
Why do you only have some of your music? Someone suggested an app to move everything from one phone to the other. I ha e an app that's only in beta at the moment and I'm hoping it will switch that too! 
Its a touchwiz based custom rom, but if you meant more in the not voiding warranty way, then yeah, sorry, there's no way of doing this without root 
My note 5 gets better speed and reception than both my Air 2 and laptop. Downstairs my nexus 5 is like unstable due to poor connection. My note 5 works wonderfully down there. I even got better cell reception. Seems I have a really good expeierence with mine.
Maybe I'm just unlucky then, I've had nothing but issues with the pen... 
http://imgur.com/a/iKdJPAlways been a fan of the Google Now Launcher. Clean and simple
Have you been able to submit your code anywhere yet? The link in the email they sent me just brings me to the promotions page. 
Gotcha.  Suspect that would cause interaction issues/battery drain, but it's an implementation I'd like to see too. This is what it should look like with notes pinned to the home screen, and it's probably the closest you're going to get. Only one tap away to be fair, and more useful than Air Command.  http://imgur.com/Pryi2ro
I used the XDA debloater tool when I got it on day one, and the only time my Note 5 wasn't buttery smooth was when I applied a theme, It was acting weird for 5 minutes, then it was smooth again. That is so weird..  As for the google messenger I wonder if its just an app bug rather than the phone. 
That's very true. I actually find the ridge created by the bumper to be perfectly placed for my fingers to rest on. 
Is that through the battery settings in the new update that was pushed over the last week?
It'll cost you that much on swappa anyways... Also unlocked and international variants will skip you out of Samsung Pay.
Open your Google settings app, go to search and now, voice, OK Google detection, and turn on trusted voice
https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/splash/sd/t/appstore?ie=UTF8&amp*Version*=1&amp*entries*=0You can follow the instructions from the above link to install their app store to get it, or you can open the Amazon app and search for Amazon Video and it should show up in the search list.
I'm going to get a new phone either the lgv1or nexus 6p to try out and then send it out to be repaired by samsung.  I will then either return the new phone or keep it and sell the note 5 when it comes back.  All depends if I like the other phones better
I only have the update from 9/25/2015 :\
It's been discussed before. Hopefully most people know better than to put the S-Pen in backwards. 
I've never had a problem with Sprint (save for the terrible data speeds a couple of years ago which has been corrected and improved since then), even with their customer service.  Any problem or concern I had, they fixed it.  What you had as an employee is not the experience I have as a customer,At least Sprint still has unlocked bootloaders on their phones (ROM flashing and root friendly) and are on average faster with their Android updates than other carriers.  My Note 4 (I have a Note 5 on T-Mo) was one of the first devices to receive 5.1.1 2 months ago on Sprint while AT&ampT just got theirs last week and I believe Verizon and T-Mo is still on 5.0.1
actually just dropped my phone in the parking lot 2 days ago. The phone fell on the opposite side and my stylus popped out and broke exactly like yours. I'm waiting on my ebay replacement to arrive on tuesday. 
Download package disabler pro and disable apps that eat your battery life. Download and use greenify. Then start having fun. It's an amazing phone.
The description doesn't specify, but I googled the model number they listed and it comes up as the fast charger. 
Been over a month since I ordered my free charger. Keep getting emails that it is backordered. Gotta love Samsung 
I really wish all 4 colors were offered in the states. I also have the same issue with wanting the white Note 5.This is bullshit. I hate Verizon so much sometimes.
It also has a lot to do with the way Google approaches the market vs Apple.Google created Android and releases it as an open source code that anyone can modify.  Carriers are able to modify the OS to their particular application needs. Open ecosystem so to speak.Apple, on the other hand, keeps a tight lid on their OS, and does not allow as much modification.  They release certain aspects of the code to developers for app development, and that's pretty much it.  A closed ecosystem.
I'll upload pictures later tonight. I also have  JEtech Tempered glass screen protector. I messed up the installations a bit but it's fine tbh.
I've been having this issue too. It's weird, because usually the menu button for most apps in general is located there.
I have the Tech21 wallet case, so it has a flip cover. It has a hole already in it for the LED light. Also, my screen stays on with the cover closed unless I lock it, or it turns off on its own. 
I would say the note  performs significantly better than my note 4. I'm on verizon, I'm not sure if that makes a difference.  The phone is much smoother and I find I am not having any weird app crashing issues which were somewhat frequent on the 4.Note5 is 64bit whereas the note 4 is 32 in the US. The note 5 camera software is better.  The wireless charging is better.  Front camera is better.  I think it runs it's software smoother with a more recent build of Android as well (on verizon again) The lack of an SD is almost a no issue for most people who stream their content as you can't transfer much significant app data to the SD anyway.  The removable battery may be an issue, but I know I have never purchased a new battery for a phone so this doesn't concern me too much. I'd buy the note 5 again if I had to.  It seems like it is the phone they wanted to make for the note 4 but couldn't at the time. 
I disagree. If you apply a glass screen protector properly you should never have any air bubbles on your screen. While Gorilla Glass is strong and can withstand scratches, accidents do happen no matter who you are. It is much cheaper to replace a screen protector than a screen.  I had my Note 5 for less than a month and started to notice hairline scratches appearing on my glass and immediately purchased a glass screen protector. I am extremely careful with my phone and use it daily without a case and have never dropped it. 
I'd still recommend the 64gb.  Especially with a lot of the deals and rebates going on. 
Change the cable or just keep unplugging and plugging your phone every time it says cable charging so you can get it to fast charge. I usually have to unplug it once or twice for it to say fast charging
I had the same thing in pictures last night
i have the same problem and would like help too. is this a bug with the latest software update?
I went from a note 3 to a note 5 and have constant dropped calls too. No change in carrier, I'm on Rogers in Toronto. Have tried changing nano sims twice, sent it in to Samsung once already. I sent it in again, hopefully they actually fix it this time. People calling me would often report it going straight to voicemail even when I'd see good reception on the display. No network connectivity even when LTE was indicated, very weird stuff.
The majority of the Google ones, Dropbox, Trello, Slack, ATK, S Note, Whats App
That's the problem though, I can't set it as default. When I go into Tap and Pay in the settings, the only payment option there is Android Pay... no sign of Samsung Pay in there anywhere.
I ran into the same problem, only way to get a vertical video to actually fill the screen is with auto rotate on AFAIK. 
For me, Google works everywhere. You have to unlock the phone before it shows results if you say OK Google from the lock screen. 
My camera lens has a raised ridge around the edge to protect it. 
The spen doesn't actually have any tech in it to track it. The detection tool only knows when toy detached the pen and walked away from the area you were in when you did it.
Check for application installer and package installer. I used the auto mode on Package Disabler and it turned those both off leaving me with the same problem you're having. 
Just a heads up I got my phone today. (Love it)4G does work on my carriers network so everything is going great. 
Its not the camera, its the app.  Most people say the front facing camera is one of the best around.
Sand or other debris in your pocket.. slide phone in and you have scratches. Drop your phone in the car, or bump up against something. Many reasons.
I've been running touchwiz, and I like it.    Life is weird that way.
I see your point. The advertising was not subtle. This definitely effected the music video, but I don't think it effected the music too much. But the tech world is quite topsy-turvey and tech companies must do what they can to market themselves competitively. Thanks for your comment.Best,John  
Yesterday only. There are other deals out there now and for black Friday though
Mine had about 50.Verizon version
Tried that. It pulsates, shows the screen that instructs you to pass it over the reader but it does not do anything. Tried it again today at a grocery store and got another dumb look by the cashier lol. 
I m using moto36with note 5, works perfectly after the software updates.
My whole line of responses was in reference to using a local wireless hard drive, which I linked to in my original post. At no point was I referring to streaming video across the internet.
Do you know if Sam's Club will have the $1 note 5 on contract like they did in the 14th?
Wow that's expensive!  90$ assuming it's in USD. I just went to Samsung service center today and they quoted me USD 30, when I collected it luckily they said that I don't need to pay. But they told me they will charge next time if the plastic level is broken again. Did you disassemble the note 5 yourself? 
Had not tried Nova launcher.I've been using Go for a few years now, on several devices.  Highly customizable
I'm currently charging my Note 5 with the Samsung Wireless Fast charger and its around 93-95?? at the moment. When I fast charge through the plug its 101-102??. I would think that 10would be normal. Every battery I've charged as always been that hot. I wouldn't think it would hurt the phone. You should be fine.
U won't get anywhere near 11 hours of SOT with 40% brightness even if you were watching your home screen icons  without touching the screen! I don't think I need to tell you about turning your location off etc ! Just figure out package disabler correctly , it may take some time. Disable the find my device option and disable Google tracking..turn off the auto brightness sensor. Fucks up the battery! At least in my case. Turn on auto restart. To he honest I don't browse the Internet that much but I spend a good 2 hours on YouTube and i text,email,sync stuff! All on 4G! I explained how to get 6+ hours of SOT a while a go and it worked for all the people who commented and I'd be more than happy to help.Cheers! 
I haven't used it much I got the phone 2 days ago and when I got it, it came dead. The past 2 days all I really been doing is checking  reddit, Instagram, twitter and checking email and those shouldn't be draining my battery that quick. 
+1 for Nova Launcher. They just had a sale, idk if it's still going on, but it was only a buck!![Nova Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher) 
Have you disabled any bloat? Do you have VoLTE enabled? Sorry for asking these questions I just want to know what to do when I get my phone
Goddamn, international unlocked user still waiting for the update. :(Sammobile doesn't seem to have this update on record. Weird.
Dec 17th Update Edit:Received generic/form email saying they appologize for the delay in responding and it's taking longer than expected.  They say they will try their best for whatever that's worth, but absolutely nothing about my actual response, just just a copy-pasta.  I replied (with what looks to be unique case number in the subject line) asking about the fact that this is cutting into the promotion period and what adjustments will be made (if any).  Even though I'm just getting a completely unnecessary gear VR, at this point, it's more about the principal - I did my part by giving my banking information to samsung to help them build momentum/support for their product, they need to do theirs.____________________________________________________Here's what's happened so far.* Submitted claim and received confirmation on Nov 28* Received bad IMEI email on Dec 9* Confirmed that the IMEI provided was indeed correct* Used web form provided in email to respond and re-provide IMEI, as well as MEID (Hex) and Wi-Fi MAC address* Received automated response of copy of my web form dataNow in a holding pattern.  A few pieces of information I've gathered so far:* PrizeLogic is handling the promotion for Samsung.  If you call Samsung Customer service, after a while on hold and a couple of transfers, you MAY get somebody that knows what you are talking about...  (Ask me how I know that part...)  That person will simply give you the number for PrizeLogic (1-888-795-6442).  After navigating their menu of Samsung promotions, you are guided a a voicemail box where you are to clearly leave your name and email address and they will email you an update.* At least for me, there was only one option on the web form for reason... Why was I rejected under a Sprint header... Sprint is my provider so the link from the original email *may* be unique to you and/or your provider.  This is odd because my provider had nothing to do with this promotion...* This is not limited to Galaxy Note owners.  There is a [similar thread in the S6 sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS6/comments/3udv2p/100_pay_promo_invalid_imei/) as well as a few similar experiences noted in [a thread on slickdeals](http://slickdeals.net/f/8345009-samsung-pay-100-promo-extended-all-samsung-s6-series-smartphones?page=13).* A few people seem to be getting somewhere but nobody seemed to have actually gotten this issue resolved.
I got my note 5 recently and was a bit surprised with fast battery drain coming from my pervious phone which was s5, now with note 5, I currently have 26% battery life with 4h SoT and it's been running for 1d and 5h.. Is that considered good?
DT Ignite is a company that allows carriers to push apps to your phone, and frankly it's a pretty scumbag system.  Verizon wants your phone to come with Candy Crush and you don't want it?  Uninstall it, and they have the power to put it right back on.  You did well by disabling it.
I think your S-Pen detection mechanism is broken. If your AT&ampT store isn't too far, I'd go see them. They'll help you or replace it. Normally, by default, the phone recognizes S-Pen removal and displays either the Air Command (when screen is on) or Screen Off Memo (when screen is off).
99.20MB man. Not Marshmallow. More like a gateway thing to Marshmallow I'm assuming.
I think something was wrong with my phone app because it gave me a message saying phone has stopped unexpectedly or something similar. I haven't had any problems since I restarted it though. 
Is adguard safe to download? 
Is the level on holiday bundle only if your switching from an iPhone or am I understanding it wrong?
All the battery saving xposed models, amplify, Greenify, power nap. Adaway = life saver SNAPPREFS
You're fine. There shouldn't be any user data in /system. I know on factory Android, you can use fastboot to flash individual partitions. Samsung doesn't use fastboot, but there shouldn't be a reason why you can't do something similar. When done right, you should have a working phone with all your data like before. 
Here is a review of it. This pen is bigger than the one that comes with the Galaxy Note 10.1, feels more like a real pen. I've had it for over three months and use this all the time. I leave the default pen docked in the Note (with the appropriate setting adjustment) to use in case I mislay this one. The size of the barrel makes it comfortable to hold, the tip seems to be accurate, and the other end can be used as an eraser in handwriting apps. The default pen is OK for occasional use, but this one is much better for continual use, which is what I need. I have a case for the Note (made by rooCASE) that has an elastic loop for holding the pen placed in a handy position, and the entire setup is perfect for me. If I ever lose this pen, I'll definitely buy another just like it.
I don't mind it running I just want to get rid of the push notifications which I see almost daily.
Wow great response thank you.I tried the felt pen with softness and couldn't achieve pure black small clean lines. Think cartoons/anime, the consistent black lines are often useful for inking. When I had the softness down and size very small black turned in to gray.Note 5 has 4gb of ram, so canvas rotation as a menu option would be great, with a warning that it requires a lot of resources.Sounds like apple is getting the good stuff! Any plans on merging the apple features in to the android build? Thanks for oyu time
If I'm correct, burst mode only works with the volume keys (hold the down key). 
I ordered 2 EP-TA20JWE adaptive fast chargers off amazon.ca from a dealer called OEM source.When I received them, neither would fast charge using the included 5ft USB cables, but when I replaced the cables with 3ft 28/24AWG cables everything worked fine. They're both plugged into samsung wireless fast chargers without issue.
Lucky. All I ever got was the wireless charger. Guess it doesn't Samsung Pay to be an early adopter.
AT&ampT versions of the Note have a setting under Display for Capacative touch button light duration where always off is an option. I don't know if international versions have this setting too. Couldn't hurt to check.
Oh, the app is simply on the Play Store! )https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.chromecast.app&amphl=en
Oh man I completely forgot I had that installed, and I had the live wallpaper picker disabled haha. Thanks for the help man
Considering exposure time literally just means keeping the shutter open, I don't see how it could be a hardware limitation.
Ok thanks. You can remove text labels in Nova settings under desktop &gt icon layout 
I'm at 1hr 43m SoT with 67% left... I have barely used my phone today. Google play services, Android system, and android os are all at the top of my battery use, with screen coming in 4th... 
And I just watched that video and will be doing that when my note arrives this week
Is the N920C not able to get LTE or is your connection worse because of the mismatch of bands? I want to get a note 5 but the US GSM phones'  prices are quite high.
Performance, definatly a boost in gaming performance, and cpu intensive tasks. Battery life, there is only a difference when you heavily tweak kernel settings like cpu speeds, governers etc.
Thanks liquidspacedragon, I think that will help! I had I had 'scan during sleep' set to on as well as 'scan for wifi' set to on. I suspect that was the culprit which is ironic because I have unlimited data and don't need wifi at all.  The thing that sucks is that when I restrict bg data for Google play and services my email won't auto sync. Very confused.
Re-flash the stock ROM fixed my problem permanently  Work around is to lock the phone for 5 seconds with all the music apps closed. https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxynote5/comments/3pq1ff/vibration_intensity/
Create an Action Memo,  save it, open S Note,  open your note,  hit More,  then Pin To Home Screen. Done. 
Sounds like a wakelock bug. https://youtu.be/fG8tghj0AYMThe new Android Marshmallow update should fix this for good. 
Every single other device works perfectly fine on the WiFi. Just played Counter Strike with 15 ping and watched a 4k video on YouTube while the phone takes 2seconds to start playing a 1080p video right after. 
Is your computer hard wired or wireless? The adapters in a phone arent going to be perfect compared to the wi-fi cards you get in a pc. Also the CPU and GPU are way more powerful than a Note 5 could ever be and rendering videos at 4k are not a problem. Also ping usually dosent have much to do with how good your internet is its based off your connection to the server. 
Swiftkey is honestly the only app I have actually ever paid for. It has went with me on multiple phones. here's a couple tips. If you don't have swiftkey's version of swype or whatever it is called on, you can swipe from right to left to delete a word. for the key that has the punctuation, swipe left or right on that key and it will automatically select the question mark or the exclamation point. Change your long press duration to around 235ms. What this does is allow you to type normally but if you need a number or symbol, it shortens the amount of time it takes to long press to get that number or symbol. 
pretty amazing how far things have come. i haven't used my camera much, just to take pictures of wiring on my dryer's heating element so that i could put back together right. it's was impressive on how much detail i could see in the dust, lol.
Maybe your maxing out your bandwidth with that many devices on one network.
alright so that throws my worries about the battery out the window, especially since the Iphone 5 I have right now has 4 hours battery time, not even SOT, just unplugged from the wall
I got the update but I'm not sure what it did exactly I haven't noticed anything different. I've never experienced any problem before or issues concerning the battery or wireless charging so I don't think I'm concerned with this update.
Yeah. Not something I can do. Though if I could find a wallet case that I could still dock I would be interested.
Check my post from earlier for battery drain fix. Also make sure you don't have the dual data share that uses WiFi and cell at the same time. Also advanced calling.
They can't allow the use of any card like LoopPay because as merchants activate EMV authentication, those cards will stop working. That's why Samsung Pay requires the bank to opt-in so that authentication is not an issue. Most larger banks and credit unions will opt-in for Samsung Pay.
Well I just noticed you can't disable it when the screen is locked
I'm currently at 4h37m of screen on time, 14h30m since last charge, at 35% battery left right now. 
You have a link where you picked up your cables? I need a fee spare ones 
Bluetooth, wifi always on, auto brightness set one or two ticks from the left,  VOLTE calls on when available, location features at most accurate. 
I've tried restarting the phone, and then factory reseted it. Didn't help. Then i went to the service center and got the software updated. Now it's gotten worse :|.Took me 20-25 seconds to be able to write anything on the screen-off memo.
I had the same issue, I believe you have to put the phone in Ultra Power Saving Mode, leave it there for a couple minutes and then take it off of it and reboot phone.Also you might find that it's better to have them off and might want to give [Galaxy Button lights](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.notquiteinsane.galaxybuttonlights) a try
I use a cheap extension cable and get fast charging when connected to the official one.
I found changing the metallic setting on the gloop pen gives a pretty cool textured splotchiness. Still playing around with it though :-)
Oh are you talking about Facebook? Yeah I really should uninstall it, heard that it does use RAM and battery a lot. 
I'm sorry, for a sec I though you were asking about wireless charging. For wired fast charging it is most likely the port that's causing the problem. I would suggest taking it back to where you got it from. It is most likely a hardware problem. Also, if you have a wireless fast charger somewhere nearby, try using that with the stock charger. That way you'll be able to narrow the problem down to either the phone or the wall charger.
It works fine for me in my 2014 F-150. Try restarting your phone and deleting previous devices in your vehicle
I've had mine for two months and in the past two weeks have had nothing but problems with it. The thing that upset me the most was my S-Pen breaking and now I have to pay to replace the phone because it's on a lease. I know I'm going to get downvoted like hell for this, but honestly if I could go back in time I would stop myself from getting this phone. It was amazing for the first month and a half. I loved it so much but like I said, it deteriorated so quickly and now I have terrible battery life with barely over 3 hours of screen on time for a full charge. Sorry for the rant, like I said I really loved this phone but it's been having so many issues. 
Make sure you authenticate with your fingerprint first.In my experience, it has worked at just about every place I have tried it at.  I've used it at least 5times.  I have also used it at Target and Home Depot without any problems.
Android pay works just fine with Root, right now.  You just have to know what you're doing...I've been using Android pay on my Rooted Note 5 since I got it.  See below for what I did to get it working:https://www.reddit.com/r/Nexus6P/comments/3rmvuy/android_pay_works_with_chainfires_new_systemless/cwpou95
Electrical power in watts is equal to voltage x current. For the most part, more watts means faster charging. 5V/2A (10W) is standard charging, 9V/1.67A (15W) is fast charging. 5V/2.4A (12W) will not be as fast as fast charging.The charging adapter's rating is just the maximum current that it is capable of supplying to whatever is plugged in. The phone's charging circuit will pull whatever amount of power it can safely handle regardless of what the number on the charger says (up to the maximum stated on the charger).
Got my charger a few weeks back. Received my mail today with the pleasure of another charger. I now have 3. Not sure what to do about the 3rd one yet
I bought several cases and the spigen slim armor is definitely the best of the bunch.
May sound silly, but if you copy the IMEI it will add spaces and cut off the last couple of digits. Worth double checking to see if you have the full code or not.
You should change your display settings and check to see if you have any current updates. When I'm not planning on doing anything major on my phone I turn on ultra saving mode. I charge my phone once every 24 hours.
I switched mine to Material Dark first day and haven't looked back.
Apparently the update is for the GearVR. I don't see the battery optimization 
You will need to update manually or via the Samsung Smart Switch software
I can't stand the location of the app drawer on the TW launcher so I use Nova
http://imgur.com/M4viMA99 hr 17 min on battery.Should be able to hit 1hrs SOT. That's with low reception too.
Take a screenshot. I'm sure the answer is still no unless you installed a third party app that is managing your defaults for you.
Yes a cheap cable can affect fast charging. I have a lot of cheap cables from Ali Express that won't fast charge my phone or deliver enough charge to my Surface even with the original charging bricks. One brand that performs as well as the Samsung cables for me is Belkin Mixit. 
After a few days you won't see it unless you're looking for it tbh unless you study the details of your screen pretty intently.
bring up Samsung pay, hit the top left where it say  Samsung pay &gt  now hit top right where it say more, go to settingturn off simple payyou are welcome :)
64gb or 32gb ?There is also the n920cd which only comes in 32gb flavour and is dual sim but will also work with all uk 4g, I think the n920c(d) is the way to go as it will help with resale value too 
Yep, I got mine. My one charger, to everyone else's 2 or 3. lol
Does the apps reload even if they are  2nd or 3rd ? Thats a constant complain i have i go back and forth and they friggin  reload. I accidentally submitted a pizza order twice that way .. grrrrrrrrrrr
Dropped mine from about 4' onto wet gravel. It still functions perfectly. Fortunately it landed on the back which cracked, but its totally cosmetic and something I can live with until my insurance is usable again. (I'm perpetually over the 2 devices/12 months limit)
I use all in one gestures to swap the back and recent apps buttons. Give it a shot. 
Well that is a perfect storm isn't it. I would need to see a source or something to see what you mean. These protectors aren't a half an inch thick and are also tapered at the edges usually. 
Did it come with a fast charging plug and cable too? Edit: just curious 
I hope to get the new gear vr
Aren't unlocked smartphones really expensive in the US? How much did this one cost you?
Are any of you having the issue of recording music on Snapchat and Instagram from your phone with your Note 5's? It records however the quality if awful and garbled when played back. This only happens when I record the music from my phone. If I'm recording outside sources it works fine. My speaker works fine too.
I can't seem to find the model number for a Samsung on a SA carrier. Most international versions have an unlocked bootloader but a specific carrier may lock it. I'm just not sure. 
I want to root but I'm having wifi issues.. half wifi speed only on the note 5.. every other devices has perfect speeds.. i tried both resetting the phone and router.. do you know anything could help if i root? I don't want to lose warranty just yet if this cannot be fixed
I've gone through five cases so far, my favorite so far (and the one I'll be sticking with for a while) is the [Ringke Fusion](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B010R8CE4O) in clear/crystal. Clear, no bulk, seems to be relatively protective&ampsup1. My runner-up would be the [Verus Crystal Bumper](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VN6NGEW) I love the dotted design on the back, it shows fingerprints *much* less than the Ringke.(&ampsup1 Dropped my phone on the sidewalk yesterday, it landed on a corner and fell face-down. No damage that I can see, though the S-Pen popped out.)
I try that same thing with my PlayStation 4. I didn't get any power. SUCKS. They should make controllers for mobile games. 
It's seriously the best smartphone camera I've ever used.
Great. Will update my list. BTW I read somewhere there is a tip where you can set you phone to one handed use and it windows your screen. It might be worth checking out, I have tiny hands and you know what they say about men with tiny hands?We use phones two handed.
Mine did this about a week ago and I reset everything and uninstalled Messenger and reinstalled.  Opened in safe mode.  Same thing.  Called AT&ampT and they said it's a known network issue and they are working on it.  Mine cleared up in a day or two and back to normal.  I'd give it a few days and see.  There is a test short code text number to At&ampt but I forgot what it was and have deleted it.  
The S6 Active is an AT&ampT exclusive, yes, we all know that. Verizon couldn't carry it even if they wanted to. Not sure what Verizon has to do with anything as OP did not even mention a carrier. The S6 Active is capable of Samsung Pay, it has just not received the appropriate software update.Unfortunately, the Active series has always been the ugly duckling of Samsung's rugged-ized line. That means that they also don't give it the attention and software updates it deserves. Add to that its an AT&ampT device, it'll be lucky if it ever gets any software updates.
Confused where everyone is getting their info. Phone definitely would not be a brick.I'm going through this myself. I was able to find an unlocked Sprint Note 5 for very cheap and couldn't pass up the offer. When i put my T-Mobile sim card in and choose 3G/UTMS from Mobile Networks... i am only able to get 3G, no LTE.  I've only had the phone for a day though, so maybe it's an APN setting things but comments i've read on XDA haven't been very helpful in setting this up. 
Mine won't be here until Tuesday but from my research, nova launcher appears to run quite well on the gn5
Bastiges, won't even answer my emails as to why my second code is not working. Anyone else buy more  than one device and successfully order more than one charger?
That's true. I've checked on eBay and there's only one listing for a gold note 5 on sprint and he's selling for $650. Maybe I can try selling it for around that price on swappa. 
What's the difference between this one and the Choetech round fast charger? I have the latter, and for the $27 it cost am very pleased. Typically charges me from ~40% to 100% in a little less than 2 hours.
I'm having similar issues and have wifi set to always. My problem seems to be only with Hangouts. Trying to determine if there's an issue there. 
WiFi will do that
I've had the exact same issue, I assumed it was just something I'd fucked up by going through and messing with wakelocks. 
/Wait, have you already recieved the verizon update (last 2 days)  I have a note 5 on verizon and I havnt updated since 9/25/15.  If you look at the updates for the galaxy S6 and edge they both have updates from a few days ago, and that is what allows them to install samsung pay correctly
You have no idea how much I love you but hate you at the same time. I just resorted to wiping my phone... and forgot to back up my text messages no more than 1minutes ago.Nooooo! But honestly, this reply is incredibly appreciated. You should make another thread with this info in case people have the same problem. I contacted Samsung Chat (I'm usually only in the mood to fix this stuff when I'm at work, so no phone call) and they would NEVER offer any help for any Samsung Pay issues. So you alone are more help than Samsung Chat support in general and can't thank you enough.I will note that I never had the ability to Uninstall Updates - is this because I installed only one copy of Samsung Pay Framework, and it didn't have a backup, since I'm on Verizon and Samsung Pay didn't come preinstalled? If so, is there a fix for that?
My stock calendar is there with TMo. http://imgur.com/dBKEiKjAre you the stock launcher? Built in widgets don't usually work with 3rd party launchers. 
Unless you're looking for a glass protector, why not just cut out the part that you need once you receive it? 
Turn it off and back on again, remove sim card and wait 6seconds. Any luck?
I have been planning on making a video about this for awhile... But your Reddit post gave me a little more motivation.  I gave you credit! Here is my method for removing the color: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxHAgPu7XAc
I have tried everything in order to remove this particular annoyance. Holding down on the notification takes me to the typical lollipop notification menu where I can choose the priority of the app. If I go to the app itself (wfservice) and try to disable notification, i cannot because not allowed to. I cannot clear it away either. Toggling the option in the advanced options menu from settings&gtWiFi does absolutely nothing as pictured. This is also in two different ROMs  too. Simply annoying. I can make it go away by Turning  WiFi off, but then I have to worry about data charges I don't want. 
They kinda expect you to use the home button :P
You me and me both. I have an AMEX attached but I really want my Chase debit card added. 
Thanks! Because it doesn't say in big flashy letters across the screen that it doesn't come with removable storage, I'm an idiot? 
Hey, could you tell me whether LTE is supported on both SIM slots or not?
Nothing, as far as I know the sensor is permanently damaged. I don't know how good warranty will be either. 
Looks like it adds an entire centimeter onto the thickness of the device. No thanks.
I don't know if you're set on the idea of getting a slickwrap but I can attest for Dbrand on my note 5, it feels real great and adds extra grip without the need for a case. As far as the cold feeling the phone gets from sitting I can kinda feel it resonate from beneath the Dbrand skin but it's definitely not as noticeable as the bare glass.
If you tripped KNOX, then no. 
I have advanced calling disabled. Still have problems if it disconnects but so far as long as I don't turn my wifi off I have no problems. I was having major problems even connecting, it would read connecting for half of a second and then just stop trying. Really hoping for an update that will fix this, it's a pretty widespread problem. I have trouble on more than just my home router too.
Nope. Got at least two emails since signing up informing me about backorder status
I think he's saying that they have white and black 32GB models, but only Black 64GB. Not that they don't have black 32GB. 
I kinda use BibleGateway a lot. I really like the layout and the accuracy of the search bar. 
I been hit &amp miss, probably 4 out of 8 tries.  It did work at golf course with old ass card reader..was surprised, but wont work at new restaurant with the card swipe on the register.  I have 2 cards loaded, Amex &amp Chase M/C and it's pretty sweet when it works.  Even if you have to use the plastic, you get instant receipt/record on transaction right to te app.  I like it...but maybe some more fine tuning needed
It's a petrolium/hydrocarbon smell (that's why it smells familiar) - the Note 5's pen has a slightly different (less pleasant) smell than the Note 4's did. I loved the Note 4's pen's smell - the 5's smells a little more burnt.
You're covered if it let you order and complete the transaction already. Just means there's a delay before you get yours, not that you're at risk of missing the promo.
I did find both NFC readers and CAC readers that I can install in my Dell. The NFC reader is very small and would be much more ideal as long as my OS will let it function as a Smart Card reader I should be ok. Since my corporate computer uses Windows, which comes with Smart Card logon for Kerboeros w/ PKINIT, I think I can enable card emulation mode on the Note 5 and Windows will think it is a Smart Card.Now if I can leverage the fingerprint reader + NFC as a form of authentication, Ill be good :)
All you have to do is pull down the notification bar and toggle the NFC option off. Likely hidden from main five buttons so either pull the on/off buttons row to the left to scroll through, or press 'edit' to see all the options at once.
I used to be peeved by that statement, but if its that easy to get you to switch to iPhone then please check how green that grass is. Frankly the inconsistency of jailbreaking is a show stopper for me, you can or can't depending on on hardware/firm rev x.x. Perm jailbreak or tethered jailbreak. Now you want to update so you have wipe everything out and load the new firmware. Hope that you jailbreak that one.. I'll pass. Like you said though, out the box without root android is so much more versatile. Hell I only have root because 1. I am a flashaholic 2. I tether my tablet and chromecast while on travel. Otherwise everything else just works..
I need the kickstand for video calls and longer videos , and the added protection is nice
It's too bad the Note 5 doesn't have a Snapdragon 810. You could've played 5 minutes of Hearthstone, and saved yourself the trouble with the heat gun! 
http://www.speckproducts.com/samsung/smartphone-cases/samsung-galaxy-note-5-cases/GN5-CS-GRIP.html#start=1Very happy with this case in black. It looks better in real life than in the picture, but the rubber ridges on the case are the best thing ever for holding it, never dropping it, never having it slip on a sloped smooth surface. 
You mean the back and menu button next to the home screen, presumably- I had the same issue but I realized it was because I had Power Saving mode on. The buttons still work, but provide no feedback and have no backlight until I turn Power Saving mode off. Hopefully that's all it is.
Yeah turn it on if you don't really plan to do much but text and make phone calls. I use it when I'm at work or sleeping usually. My phone lasts for 2 days
I used to have this issue on the T-Mo S6E but it hasn't been a factor on the Note 5.  VoLTE and WiFi-Calling are both on.
I consider myself a power user, just yesterday I recorded my first meeting, transcribed the comments from two different people in the recording and emailed them off. Tethered my laptop to stream a youtube video the company I work for posted to some customers visiting.Streamed music while at my desk, did a video call so a supplier could show us some deflects on items that had arrived and that was before lunch.  I may be a small use case but don't assume oh if my screen is on for 6 hours I don't have a life. I am also not calling 4 to 6 hours mediocre.I think another assumption is that these people **need** this. I doubt that is the case for everyone.  It's android and it has a big battery.  People are going to strive for big numbers as bragging rights and proof of concept. If I push my car to 400hp does that mean I'm going to be driving at breakneck speeds everywhere I go ~~yes~~ nope.
If it's better I think I may too.  Going to really pay attention to how I use the S pen next few weeks to see if I'll regret it
I am a pretty heavy user.  Face buried in my phone kind of deal.As for my signal, l usually have full bars or close
Why should I use Samsung Pay rather than Android Pay?
I just used the non fast wireless charger cable with my fast adapter and got the quick charge. During my nap on non fast, phone went from 49% to 60%. In the last 2minutes of playing with my son, went from 61% to 100%. 
I think it's gorilla glass 4 and so that scratch. What I don't like about not having a case is that my hands sometimes touch the screen and activate it. Because of the thin bezels.
That's a lot of hand writing on peices. Don't they make like upwards of a million each cycle? I couldn't imagine being the poor bastard to QC and mark the same piece... Over and over again, everyday.That would be mind numbing lay boring
You should buy colored screws, if you can find the right size. Or find a way to paint or otherwise color those screws. It'd look cool if they were all metallic orange, red or blue. Find out the size, pick up some screws in the color of your choice, the put them in place with a thin cloth or something over the screw so the screwdriver doesn't scratch off the color. 
Go to Settings, then S Pen Settings and turn off the S Pen detection and it'll still work. The only thing that won't is auto popping up the S Pen menu and writing on the screen when off.
I have a tempered glass protector on it, the first time I've ever tried one on a phone. It's pretty much imperceptible except for a thin border line around the edges which is just about hidden by most cases' lip protection anyways. You can't notice that anything is on the screen, IMO, and the benefits of having it take the fall for you in a drop far outweigh the small cosmetic loss, I think.
If the cord and wall adapter being changed don't work, and restarting/resetting doesn't work, it's a problem with the phone you won't be able to fix.
The clock widget is zooper (from the separately downloaded MIN pack). And icon packs are mainly Aurora and a few others when I didn't like those particular ones. Using nova launcher. 
Lemon. Last time I use an emoji on reddit haha
Actually Whatsapp and Facebook app are allowed !
can you please share the font name?
There is no way he is getting 12 hours of screen on time in actual use. Turn the brightness the lowest and stare at a black picture?
My experience with multiple phones and a tablet is that FB and/or Messenger use up the battery pretty well. When I owned the Note 4, all I did was disable (normal disable, not through PDP) FB and messenger and suddenly I was getting an extra hour of battery life plus general performance was better. I posted in the Note 4 sub and a bunch of people responded with similar responses, many not understanding why it works so well, but just generally saying it was a completely better experience, some even saying along the lines of like a new phone!I've not really done any testing with my note 5, but I generally have FB disabled (only enable it when I'm uploading a lot of pictures), and when I do enable it I'll be lazy and leave it on for a few days. It might be me looking for it to be worse, but it seems like battery life is worse when FB is on.
I don't know. I've heard 10% after the first year. Which means I'll still get over 5 hours of SOT. I don't really care because I upgrade every year. Worst case scenario, you can always change the battery.
I can't think of where this might've come from, since the last time I opened the music app (about 1hours ago) it wasn't there. I certainly haven't downloaded anything between then and now. Also, it was named baol.3gp but I have no clue as to what that might mean, or even what language it's in. 
For me, disabling volte and WiFi calling fixed that, but not to the point where I get significantly better battery life. 
I'll just stick with my fast charging external battery pack, thanks.
I'm speaking for Samsung devices. If you use fingerprint, then you can only set a password as a backup, and not a pin, and there doesn't seem to be a way around that. That is just the way Samsung has implemented their password and security features.One would assume that if you use something as secure as your fingerprint, that you would also want a secure backup password and not a simple PIN, which may explain the password-only requirement. PINs are easy, passwords are not (or should not be), like your fingerprint. lol
Just checked. Mine is starting too. Didn't have it an hour ago!Edit: Can confirm, pay works now. Its in the play store
Used package disabled pro to disable all bloatware from Samsung and Tmobile. Battery saving mode, the regular one, not extreme. Screen on basic. Action Launcher 3.
I have the Choetech faster charges but not the Samsung one so I can't compare the two, but the Choetech charges about 40% quicker than the standard wireless charger.Here's what the Choetech says. http://imgur.com/yVL5ddy
this has been happening to me and usually at the same parts on a song. I think it's most likely the headphone jack, but at this point I don't care enough to have it checked out
Sorry if that was unclear. I meant a phone skin. 
About 6 hours or so. Mostly on WiFi with moderate use. 
Also if you're on T-Mobile, disable volte, and change WiFi from always scanning to off.
Check out an S View case.  I love the added functionality.  Fast wireless chargers are available on amazon for half the cost of the official one from Samsung. Double pressing the home button brings up the camera so you're less likely to miss a good shot. Welcome to owning the best android phone currently available! 
Watch out, my screen cracked in my pocket after 12 days having the device. Going to try to deal with Samsung Canada but I'm not expecting much help. Sucks because I've always bought Samsung... no idea why the screen cracked (and one day before my otterbox defender came in the mail).
[Simple as that](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Sview+note+5+leather+case)

I chose the case instead of the charger and finally received the case today about 3 weeks later 
Ignorance of what?I don't know how to build my own CPU, are Intel scammers for selling me one?
Drive to work, 45 mins screen on time for GPS (waze to monitor traffic and hazards), 45 mins of screen on time at lunch (games, browsing, facebook, etc), 1 hour of SoT taking notes in a meeting,  45 mins screen on time for GPS on the drive home.  Look at that, over 3 hours SoT and it hasnt interfered with any social situations or productivity whatsoever.What was the point of this shitpost anyway?
Got this case after reading your post. It was just what I was looking for, grippy back, protects the screen, good protection (I don't need a lifeproof case because I don't punt or throw my phone), and looks nice with the electric blue edge.
I use the clear Urban Armor Gear with the black (blue) Note 5 and love it. It seems quite sturdy with only accidently dropping it a couple of feet. Also, gorilla glass screen protector works great.Edit: I had just upgraded from an S4 with an Otter box and this setup, somehow, feels less bulky in my pocket.
Even if it was available, it wouldn't be able to be turned on until a software update was released.
Always rooted and Rom'd never had an issue with a warranty claim or trade in on T-mobile.Also I wasnt sure but you saying not being able use Samsung Pay and Android pay if rooted attributes to Samsung not being as great as it used to be?
Hm. That's looks cool but it has no support for MicroSD. I want to be able to use my old one from my S4.
Mine is starting to do this as well. The clicker on the pen is getting named in the depressed position. I've always been able to get it out after fiddling with the clicker, but if it doesn't come out, I'm not sure how to correct it. 
The previous note had two variants..snapdragon and exynos..snapdragons were the ones which got cyanogenmod. 
OneNote, Office Lens (I like the integration with OneNote over other camera pdf apps), Outlook (if you use outlook for work), Snapseed, OneDrive, Google Photos (backup and cloud storage for your photos). Inbox for gmail. Textra for texting. I prefer SwiftKey over Google keyboard. 
I have both, I prefer the Note 5 over the 6P. Note 5's image is sharper, focuses faster and personally when viewed on the computer, the color is more pleasing to my eyes. The 6P also under exposes (darker image) by about 1 stop.
Okay, this is happening to me too. I'm using the charger that came with it (Verizon Note) and it charges super fast, but it also gets hot sometimes. Not always, but when it does, it kinda bothers me.
I submitted mine 12/8 and got an acceptance email yesterday, I wonder how long it would take, also if you don't mind me asking is the wireless charger the standard version or fast charger?
I was going to get a screen protector for more of a scratch resistant that a shatter proof. Still same opinion?
What I did was disable wi-fi calling and volte. The I used package disabler pro to freeze all the bloatware I didn't want. That solved it for me. I finally ended up rooting the phone and it's even better.
Backstory!I originally went on a vacation to Disney World to kick back, relax, and not really do much of anything. I also had tasked myself with taking some photos of the Osborne Spectacle of Dancing Lights, as this is the last year for the attraction. What ended up happening was an adventure to try to find a photo that the Galaxy Note 5 camera couldn't take with a reasonable amount of tweaking.What you're seeing in the album is a small selection of some of the BEST photos I got on the trip.I tried to take photos at all times of the day, in all types of light, backlit, spotlit, day, night, fireworks to trip out the automatic exposure, and couldn't find a situation that didn't produce amazing pictures. They were so good, the DSLR I'd taken along (a Canon T2i) stayed packed away in the bag.I'm considering selling my camera.
I was all set on getting the 6p..... then I read all the complaints on the 6p subreddit.   I went to Best Buy, looked at several phones, and I ended up with the Note 5.    About battery life.. I've been able to have more than 4 hours onscreen, and still have enough battery at the end of the day.Complaints:  The Note 5 comes with Flipboard as a news provider we can place on your leftmost screen.  I like Flipboard...... but even if I log in with my account, the flipboard that we can place on our leftmost screen doesn't conform to my account, meaning the news on the Note 5 version has headlines on stuff I don't care about.  Sure, I can customize the Note 5 Flipboard, but why do I have to, when I already have an account that's customized to my tastes?Some apps re-start sometimes(Pandora) .  This happens when I have my phone connected to my watch through bluetooth.  Sometimes the connection is lost, and there will go Pandora... restarting.There are a few stutters.  It's nothing bad enough that will make me curse TouchWiz.   It doesn't happen often.The Note 5 for Verizon comes with bloatware.  It's not really bad, but I hate having bloatware that takes up space even after disabling them.  I imagine that the 6p doesn't have any bloatware (for comparison).Besides those complaints, I really like my phone.  I've been using stock Android for two years, and I've realized how much I don't like stock Android now that I've played with TouchWiz.  
You need to use a charger with the correct rating that supports quick charge 2.otherwise you won't get the full effects of quick charging 
I'm having similar issues with my Note 5 and I'm on Verizon. Never had a single complaint when talking on my HTC One M7, but ever since I switched to the Note 5, I've had dropped calls and phone calls cutting in and out.
I just realized I can fix it by tapping fast and randomly, maybe there is some sort of calibration issue?
One of the most infuriating part is when you have fingerprint security and smart lock enabled, every time you turn the screen on, it's a guessing game whether you should have your thumb on the home button or swipe the screen in order to unlock. It pisses me off. Also, **who at Samsung thought it is a good idea to add lag after swiping the screen before unlocking???**  As much as I'm surprised with a lot of things that they fixed with TouchWiz, I am really baffled with some of the UI elements they have in there. Edit: fixed lag by disabling unlock effect. In order to do that, however, you must first change back to swipe unlock mode (exit fingerprint unlock mode) to view the option to change the unlock effect. 
No problem! I wonder if there's a app similar to Lightflow that has a option to keep the notification light on regardless. 
That's pretty normal. I assume you have a few accounts syncing, plus you never mentioned signal strength or over how many hours that 4 hours screen time takes place. Are you streaming music, etc? 
I wonder if there is a batch of fake notes in USA passed off to a cell network
From Citi's website:Samsung Pay is only available on Citi branded consumer credit and debit cards (except for ATM cards, American Express cards, AT&ampT Universal Cards and AT&ampT Access Cards from Citi, and Citi?? / AAdvantage?? cards) issued in the United States when using the following US based phone carriers: U.S. Cellular, Sprint, T??Mobile, Verizon, and AT&ampT.
6P--&gt V10Happy. The audio quality is so fucking good. That's the main thing I use (headphones) so it's a win for me. IR, camera and removable battery/SD are icing on top. The V1is very underrated. I've had the Note 5 before, too. It's nice, but I never used the pen and battery anxiety drove me crazy.
Maybe it was removed with the last update?Only way I can have them not light up is in battery saving mode.
Doing some research, it seems that it's not glass but plastic.So that's why it scratches so easy! I think there's nothing i can do if it's plastic instead of glass
The only thing you can do is prepare for the future so it doesn't happen again. Setup Dropbox or Google Drive to backup pictures and videos when you're connected to wifi. 
My pen runs smoothly on my Zagg screen! 
If the phone is completely off. Try holding volume up+home button+power key hold it and it should boot into recovery where you can perform a factory reset.If that doesn't work it may be a hardware problem. OR needs to be flashed stock firmware. If you can bring it to sprint they should swap it out for you if you just bought it 
I've got the ATT version of the Note 5 and this thing drinks battery like a white girl drinks pumpkin spice anything.   Its REALLY BAD.Apple has been gracious enough to repair my iPhone, so I'm switching back.   I barely had to charge that thing once every 1.5 days.   With my Note 5, I'm lucky to get 6 hours.   Ugh. 
Yeah that's true but have you tried Android Pay?
You ever consider upgrading to the D750? That camera is a Swiss army knife of photo and video shooting. I'm currently saving up for one myself
Which were announced and talked about long before release and various people at Oculus talked about working on. None of that has been happening for the Note 5 to think it could continue.
Clear TPU case gives you the best of both worlds, gives you a good grip and can withstand a normal drop
New note5 here....i have have this happen to me a couple of times in the last few days. The screen rotation just doesn't work.  Reboot fixes it for me. ..it is annoying. 
I got mine. Ordered the VR. It's on back order though. 
I have once or twice then I started using another app to send it because it had to be so small file size wise that it's hard to get correct.  Also the resulting video is so pixulated after its sent is worse than a potato.  
I don't actually have another working phone or camera so I can't right now but if I get the chance and I upload one. 
Hope you didn't plan on using Android Pay / Samsung Pay.
I just upgraded from an S4 as well a few weeks back, I had a 32gb SD card and 2 zero lemon batteries that I would swap out so I had reservations about getting a note 5. Don't regret it at all now, been getting 4.5-5 hrs SOT with location and wifi/lte on all day. The fast charging definitely takes care of the non removable battery for me.
I'm in the same boat with cell standby and Android system, each being around 25%-30%. Killing battery overnight of about 15-20%. Going to turn off WiFi calling and volte to see if anything changes, of not then I guess its going back to T-Mobile since I just got it yesterday -__- Edit: scratch that, I got it two days ago. 
It's not super strong, but it goes through [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0146U30MY/ref=yo_ii_img?ie=UTF8&amppsc=1) case pretty well. I haven't tested it on any othersIt's not super fast either. About the same speed as normal not-fast-charging.
the cable doesnt make it fast charge
I have owned 3 Note 4's, and 2 Note 5's. I trade phones a lot. While I liked the Note 4 a good deal, the Note 5 is my favorite phone ever made, and it is not close. The way Samsung redesigned the latest Note makes it so worth not having the removable back. The curves on the back make it fit into your hand so much better than any other phablet ever made. I laugh when I put my Note 5 next to my 6S Plus, which will soon be sold, and see how much thinner and easier it is to hold the Note 5 even with a bigger screen. It is just so sharp and well designed.The screen is the best in any current smartphone IMO. I like the new S Pen better than last gen. With some tweaks I am able to get more battery life out of the 5 than I was with the 4 even with the smaller battery. The fingerprint scanner is so much more convenient as it is practically unusable on the 4. I pretty much like everything about the 5 more than the 4. Last I checked, Note 4's were still selling for around $400. I have seen 5's on craigslist for $50or so. At this price difference you have to get the 5. I got my on Jump On Demand for T-Mobile, then swapped for a 6S plus. The 6S plus was terrible compared to the Note 5. I found a steal of a deal on another Note 5 that had the water damage sensor set off and had some moisture in the cameras. I got the moisture out with rice and I could swear this one runs even better than my original brand new Note 5. I don't miss the removable back at all. If the price isn't a dealbreaker for you, you won't regret choosing the 5.
Wow. So the camera and flash humps are just flush with the glass cutouts? It really looks like they're sitting on top of the glass.
Well that experience was underwhelming.  Citi, USBank, Amex and BoA only?Looks like I'll continue to use Android Pay for now.  I would really like to use the Samsung Pay at [swipe terminals.]( http://www.androidcentral.com/whats-difference-between-android-pay-and-samsung-pay)
I figured it out, it was because I was flashing the recovery via Odin with auto reset on, if I flashed it and did not reset, but powered off and then went into recovery and flashed kernel, it was fine from there. Auto reset was resetting the recovery to stock.
What Reddit app do you use because I like the one I'm using but it doesn't seem to be able to post pictures. I'm using sync reddit. Trying to post pictures from my phone of updates. I got like 54 minutes of screen time and I'm at 69%. Not sure how great that is 
I took a quick peek on Sprint's website at their unlocking policy and the S6 and S6 edge are capable of sim unlock so I don't see why the Note 5 wouldn't be. I would say call again and ask them for the domestic sim unlock. Be very specific about that. 
Has anyone actually received either the free wireless charger or free year of netflix? I got this device on launch day and signed up for both promos. The free wireless charger one, after samsung pay came out, has been in backorder status since. The status of netflix promo just says emailed
I got this update a week ago. It mainly added an enhanced App Optimiser, which is similar to Marshmallow, in that it analyses your app usage over time and automatically hibernates them. Although it didn't seem to do anything much at first, over the course of a week, my standby time has improved dramatically. Normally, by the time I finish work (9 AM to 6 PM), it used to be around 20-30%, now it's around 40-50%. It's doing something, alright.
That update was for all carriers except verizon. Our update supposedly just started yesterday. But so far it looks like it's only been S6 devices, no notes. 
Something I really like to do with my Note after taking pictures is using Snapseed and the stylus to edit. Snapseed has a brush feature which lets you paint over parts of the picture to modify color, saturation, exposure, and a few other things. Really a useful edit with the stylus - the app and the phone were practically made for one another. 
As soon as I take off the charger, it resets to and starts logging everything. No permission or anything special required. Although Wifi, data, and bluetooth time are almost accurate, I'm very skeptical about the held awake time. It says that my phone is held awake for 3 hours for example. But in reality, when I add up the apps that report significant awake times, it only adds up to about 2 hours or so. I should start looking for an alternative battery app...
7+  mind you I keep battery saving on and use package disabler pro.  I'm on verizon
I'm not finding the app super useful since there's nothing stopping someone from just Uninstalling it in the app manager.   Maybe in missing something...
I'm just talking about the scraping. You can't scratch the glass, and it's hard to get it all off. It's very tedious. You have to use rubbing alcohol to soften it up first, too. I used to do a lot of this when I worked at an electronics refurbishing warehouse. 
Do you have a glass screen protector, or a regular plastic one? Plastic screen protectors don't have this problem. 
Hmm. Just went back to the play store. It let's me download it. Weird 
Screen is basically a note 4 screen on the 6p.  It's nice, but not as nice.   Efficient but not as efficient. Camera is better to me on the note 5, but that 240fps video on the 6p is cool.  Ultimately the spen and hw buttons won me over.
I gave up on the default email app and downloaded Mailwise. The app worked great and my moto36now allows me to read emails as they come in. 
Oh shit! Wow, thank you. Exactly what I wanted. Forgot about themes. 
It's just that it tries to auto correct with email addresses and no other phone of mine has ever done that. 
Cinema, not on auto. I could have gotten higher honesty, I was on 100% for some time.
SD Maid
I have both. The battery life on the S6 is abysmal. That's why it's relegated to my drawer now. I use it when exercising. The Notes battery is much better, and its better at multitasking as well. 
I've only ever used Dropbox and have no complaints or reasons to try something else. Also I don't really even use it that much. Sorry for the crappy response. 
Try switching the mobile network and toggle between them and see if that helps.
Isn't a one piece case weaker than a two piece?  I'm struggling with cases and their ability to work well with a tempered glass screen protector. 
Really hoping this gets resolved in time to actually use the promo. Will update if I hear anything back.Edit: Just received email saying claim has been approved. Entered in the code and it worked! 
Yes. I got an email once they were approved.
I hadn't thought about it... but the s-note app plus split screen would actually work for this pretty well.
[Call Recorder by skvalex](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skvalex.callrecorder). Check your local laws first and whether they'd apply. It works natively without root and can automatically backup after the call ends. I did end up disabling the App Optimization on it after it missed recording a few critical calls.It's more for CYA purposes for me. I've gone back to maybe three calls to get some info I forgot. I haven't busted it out yet for legal purposes or to shame a company for being unreasonable hopefully it never comes to that.
Did this happen while playing with it or while simply ejecting it?Am really avoiding playing with that apart from ejecting the pen as I feel it won't live that long being raped that much.
Nice lucky you. I can't complain I got two chargers and getting free VR. That faster charger does look sweet though. How many Mah is it rated? Hopefully bigger than 3000.
I cant tell that any of his are on? This is my developer settings with all the options turned off. (I use material dark) http://imgur.com/3lwSdsG
I had this exact same issue.  I posted a similar thread a bit over a month or so ago.   Contacting Samsung support, they told me to first turn it off and turn it back on again, second to do a factory reset, and third to send it in for warranty repairs.   This was frustrating, because the first two steps will be tried by almost everyone who's ever successfully used a computer.Anyway, I sent it in for warranty repairs, and they fixed it without charging me a penny!  They sent me a packing label and everything.  My largest gripe is their communication was really lacking.   They didn't tell me when they received my phone, they text me when the repairs were complete (but were supposed to reach out describing the problem and whether it was covered or not, and didn't) , didn't tell me when it was being sent back and didn't require a signature for the package - it was sitting on my stoop in the rain when I came home one day.   Can't complain too much though - my phone now works perfectly fine again! 
I'm not sure.  There was a list of promotions that PrizeLogic listed in they phone systems, one of them could have definitely been the Gifts of the Season one.  I had to use 'other promotions' for this.  Couldn't hurt.  Did you resubmit your IMEI?  Heard anything back?
How long do they take to approve these claims? It's been over a week for my wireless charger and they haven't approved that one yet... so I'm apprehensive on this one.
This is interesting.. never noticed that. GSAM shows my signal strength at work is between low and med (3-4 bars above low). Rate of change is rouhgly 10%/hr with all disabled (except loc), no google location tracking, no fb, wifi scanning always off, tasker scanning location every 5 mins instead of 1 as default and bunch of stuff disabled in pdp.
Yeah, not sure what Google is thinking with the non-US pricing.. For what it's worth, I also recently chose the Note 5 over the 6P, and I have no complaints with this latest iteration of Touchwiz. I hope you enjoy your Note 5 too.
Probably not with either. The zero lemon case shows that its going to be like .06 inches thicker. But not completely sure if it will eork 
I love my Google rewards credit. I give so many bad books a chance that I otherwise wouldn't have bothered with
Google play services are usually just the OS. Maybe try a factory reset and go from there.
I can't comment on home button durability, but due to the same concerns I've been using Gesture Wake-up (under Accessibility &gt Dexterity and Interaction) which has greatly reduced the number of times I click any button. It's pretty convenient for someone who works at a desk, and the effect on battery life seems to be minimal.
It does but you do need a software update from your carrier.
Yeah unless you have the AT&ampT or Verizon Note 5 there are some root methods in the XDA forums.. I haven't personally rooted but some people say if you were to ever send your phone to a Samsung repair center they may turn you down If they see Knox was triggered. Besides that since you don't care for Samsung pay go right on ahead. 
The ones I tried (Ailun x 2, Xtremeguard, Pleisin, a couple ones I couldn't identify from ebay) all halo'd on my phone. I even tried a very nice full-frontal cover protector (as in, covered the entire front, not just the screen), and while it gave me the least halo, there was still a tiny bit that annoyed me.Most of the glass ones I tried were slightly larger than the screen itself. Tried all with a Spigen Slim Armour, the only one that gave me issues was the full-frontal protector.I ended up going with a Spigen PET film protector and am happy. I'll take it over nothing.
As of right now there is no root method.. It may be a very long time as the AT&ampT and Verizon note 4s dont even have permanent root still. However chainfires systemless root method shows promise. 
That's normal and desirable for a wireless charger. Continuously topping off your charge on a full battery is bad for your battery. I'm curious as to how you are using your phone while it's charging on the wireless charger.
Sorry to hear about your troubles, not a good way to start the day. Try going to Andriod-lost(.com). Its an app that will help control just about everything on your phone. Im pretty sure they have an option on the website that will alow you to push the app onto your phone. After that you can control it and GPS locate it. Hope this helps
Is your music stored on your phone or in the cloud? 
Sapphire is a fingerprint magnet, fingerprints aren't really noticeable on white. Gold will likely be as bad as sapphire, but looks cool so whatever haha 
I got the white... I traditionally get black as it makes the screen blend in with the bezel easily. But, Samsung's Sapphire Black is really navy blue. And it looks awful with most cases (especially black). 
Yeah it really surprised me. What is strange is a lot of people have been reporting great SOT with PDP but after a few days - a week with nothing changing it goes back to being horrid.Yesterday i took it off charge at 6.30am used it fairly heavy for calls, poop games etc and at 11pm and just under 5h SOT with about 8% left - Which for me i am more than happy with. 
The invisishield glass are really nice screen protectors, more like an extra layer of glass than a condom on your screen.

I use the Aukey quick charge cables. They are compatible with the fast charging. https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00SWAZD34/ref=ya_aw_od_pi?ie=UTF8&amppsc=1
It's a launcher that I use instead of the one that comes with the Note 5. You should check it out on the play store.
How do you know when it's time to replace the tip? I almost never use my stylus. Maybe once every six months to be safe? Once a year?
I tend to stick with the S Note app for all that and Google Calendar for events later in the day. Remember, when you write anything in the quick memo or S note app, you can hold down the button on the stylus drag it across whatever you wrote, it'll convert it to everything from a contact entry to a task list. Makes it very very quick and easy to check off things you need to do right after you do them.http://imgur.com/M8WAAuf example 
I noticed this yesterday, it smells like a battery  when you leave it inside a toy for too long and it explodes. Reminds me of my childhood toys lol
I'm getting about 5-6 hours of screen on time, so I'd say 1% per text message is not normal.
Go into settings and disable some things that you won't need. I just switched from the Nexus 6 to the Note 5 last week. I recommend turning off Direct call, Mute, Palm Swipe to Capture, Smart Stay, Adaptive Display, Wallpaper Motion Effect. That might help speed it up a tad. 
I'm thinking about it as well. It's so hard to give up the note though. If the camera is better than I will make the switch. 
&gtBut where is dat marshmallow update verizon, samsung?It's been 15 days since the update came out on Nexus devices.If you're serious, your expectations are way too high.
No, I bought *A* phone without knowing it didn't have an SD card slot. Really! 
Here we go again. Samsung just isn't good at GPS. 
It's about $6here in Canada including labor. I like this strategy and made a post just now about it. However the battery life on a single charge on the Note 5 compared to the Note 4 is turning me off.
Mobile payments at the remaining 90% of retailers in the US that don't(and won't) support NFC. You can wave it over the magnetic strip reader and buy things. ??It thinks you swiped a card. ?? A form of host card emulation that doesn't need NFC Not to say that you should use it INSTEAD OF android pay, I use it in addition to. Android pay if they take NFC, Samsung pay if not. 
Not saying its correct but the thought process on their side might be: You aren't connected to mobile network so you probably want WiFiYou aren't connected to WiFi so lets give an option So I would say they are probably looking for you to either turn off WiFi or turn airplane mode on if the situation is  I don't have mobile data connection and I don't want a WiFi connection . Although you are right you should be able to turn this off I don't believe there is a way to do so.
I switched to a Note 5 from a Nexus 5 and haven't really found myself missing anything from stock android.I now use the pen for work daily and have no plans to switch to a phone that has no stylus unless I eventually get a Surface or other tablet that supports handwriting.
Just upgraded from the iPhone 5s today. This is my first Android phone and it's been a great introduction. Anyways here is what I have done so far:* Debloated [\(here for instructions\)](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=62458292)* Installed Nova Launcher* Installed the Hi Locker lockscreen (I only found 2 that support the fingerprint scanner and this one is my favorite)* Made the switch from Alien Blue to reddit is fun* Spent 2 hours downloading my Spotify library only to realize that I didn't have extreme quality selected. I then spent 3 hours downloading it again.If I you think I overlooked something please let me know but right now I'm pretty damn comfortable with the phone coming from 4 years of jailbroken iPhones.Some things I miss from (jailbroken) iOS:* When you try to scroll past the end of the page on iOS you would keep scrolling a little and then bounce back up. On Android it just stops abruptly and if I'm not expecting it, sometimes I think my phone has frozen.* Tweak to let you unlock your phone by touching the fingerprint scanner, as opposed to pressing the home button.* I think some podcasts I listen to are only available on iTunes, but I will have to confirm.
But you're a photographer? 
I guess that's a situation where Apple designed their infrastructure with their Maps (initial directions accuracy aside) servers more efficiently, I only played around with it for a bit but my experience with their 3d view was very smooth. Then again, closed device/software ecosystem&gtthird party devices running google apps. Wonder how earth runs on Nexus phones.
Specifically have it turned off on my lock screen and see it there all the time!
Ive been using it at various retailers with an Amex card with only one failure out of 6 tries. This includes bestbuy, subway, turkeyhill, and a small restaurant with a not-very-fancy card reader. 
Heck yeah, that's a good haul! Covers like half the cost of the phone right there.
Instagram. Start taking some cool pictures cuz this camera is bonkers. Also if you don't trust the battery life, I learned that the Quick Charge 2.chargers work with Samsung fast charging, so you might wanna grab one of the Aukey quick charge battery banks on amazon just for the off chance you need a charge while out and about. 
I'm just going to assume that this violates the warranty...? 
The developer section is not there by default. Go to setting , scroll down to about device , software info , tap on build number from 7 to 1times. Go back to settings and it should be right above the about device section!
So I got mine today... they sent three. I got one black one and two white ones. I of course only ordered one. The fedex guy that dropped it off said something about these samsung packages being all screwed up with multiple incorrect addresses or something. TY for three free wireless chargers samsung
S-Note is my favorite, too. 
You disabled smart manager.  Re-enable it and your battery will come back. 
[Here's a possible solution.](http://bobmckay.com/i-t-support-networking/solved-samsung-galaxy-s6-wireless-charging-problems-charging-paused-repeatedly/)I've been using a different [fast wireless charger](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015O4EZHA/) with the original Samsung adapter and cable and haven't had any issues. Charging only pauses when full.
I just checked these guys out, but it looks like none have screen protectors. I feel this is necessary for my uses.
Yes. If the removable storage/battery aren't important to you, the Note 5 is a great upgrade. 
It's physically damaged and broken. Will either need to be sent in for repair, or have the sensor board part ordered and installed. Samsung warranty will not cover this, either. I just asked them last night.
Download Poweramp. The default music app seems to have problems with VBR mp3 files. 
I wasn't trying to imply you're an idiot, so sorry if it came off that way.  I was only making this post as an example of how to extend your battery life without going nuts on PDP.  IMO, my phone acts like a flagship should.  I got rid of nearly everything that I find superfluous and unusable in a daily setting.  And while I agree that it takes a little research before jumping in, I disagree that my opinion of anyone who doesn't know how to do it is a fucking idiot.  In fact, I sympathize.  This is my first experience with PDP, and it did take some time.  That is why I posted this album to help others learn and save them that time.  If it works for them, great.  If not, maybe it gave them some help in learning.  And as far as cell standby, nothing has cured that drain.  PDP didn't do anything for me in that regard.  The only thing I found that works is by putting my phone into airplane mode when I'm in locations that I know I won't be getting reception in.  And come on, in none of my posts did I ever act or do anything like this:&gtyou guys do it and tell anyone who has trouble with the process that they must have no idea what you're doing, you fucking idiot.
I want to run it without a case but all it takes is one drop...
I just got my note after having a shitty candybar phone for years. Holy bajesus. I love this thing. Running multiple windows, the apps, oh the apps. My brother was super pissed because I got over 500on a graphics benchmark while his 6s plus barley made 2000. The screen looks like candy Aphrodite made. The s-pen is super neat and useful at work. The cameras are better than my wife's actual camera. I found a few useful videos. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-w27W1pC8- more basic note 5 specific stuff https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmpBd_VmtBM - goes over some of the same stuff but also teaches you how to speed things up a bit. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9CCt4RHLFc&ampfeature=youtu.be - #1 of 3 in a series that covers a whole lot of features about it. Hope those help.
I'm not saying it is or isn't an issue. That is why I put it in quotation marks because I would use the word issue loosely. I was more so correcting the idea that apps present in recents equates to apps present in memory which is not true.As far as being able to stream and ram management my caveat was that most of those complaints are from s6 owners.**TLDR** Apps in recents don't equal apps in memory
If you have t-mobile, you should ask them. Otherwise you're better off selling and then putting that money towards buying the s6+.Also the edge+ is worth more than the note 5 so you probably won't find anyone to straight up trade you
It is Samsung Air Wakeup service! I enabled it and it is working fine now. Placing your phone properly on a flat surface is a must though, tried it a couple times but it doesn't work well while holding the phone in hand.
Look at restrict background data. 
Mine would be at about 40-50% with those numbers. Do you guys play a lot of games or Netflix or something or did I get a magical Note 5?
I hear its battery problems, my Note4 did the same and my note5 started doing it too. Not sure if warranty comes in place tho.
OK, I just filled in the forms for the $10promotion...crossing my fingers it works!
Like your phone in total lasted only 9 hours on a 100% charge? (I'm debating buying one and battery life is really important)
How does he not mention the Note 5 for battery life? He gives second place to the 6P which he noted gets less than 5 hours of SoT while my Note 5 and many others can go above 5 hours SoT.
you probably didn't use the device much for the screen to be a significant percentage. Keep using it and see if it appears there. 
Ok sorry it's not the one that holds the note 2 pen but it's still a bigger stylists in an S Pen most reviews say it's bigger than the pen that comes with the 10.1 inch and that it's the size of a standard pen or pencil sorry
Min,  free on play store 
[Simple](http://imgur.com/ps8Ofex)I use the home button to bring up phone search to eliminate the use of an app menu.[Example](http://imgur.com/uT8LlDV)[Home](http://imgur.com/EpFUaS7)And I use a folder some more common apps when you press the home icon that aren't quite as common as chrome or textra but still nice to have ready.Edit - to test link formatting on mobile.
What's the solution? Just dropped my phone and now the pen is stuck the right way in and I can't even touch it since it's a bit deeper than it should be.
Hi! I'm thinking of getting the note 5 from globe too, but the CS agent tells me that both sim slots are locked? 
I did them all roughly 3 weeks ago and recently got an email saying the IMEI is incorrect. It's correct and I double checked. They only have a little form to contact them online and there's no way to call them to speak directly to someone. 
It really is. I wish Google acquired mst so everyone could use the technology 
I've been using my ps4 controller all you have to do to pair it is hold share and ps button together until it starts flashing then you should be able to pair the controller with your phone through Bluetooth. Works great with my emulators. Haven't tried pairing it back to ps4 yet but not to worried about it. 
Be careful with Themer. I've tried it several times, but it has always been a serious drain on my battery. In the end, I just spent a couple of evenings with Nova and I'm in my happy place...
The search bar is your friend.
Isn't a problem? Unless there's a scratch proof screen out there, I'll keep my screen protector.  Don't tell me that Gorilla Glass 4 is scratch proof because it isn't. I've had screens with Gorilla Glass get scratches enough times to not leave it naked.I'd much rather a plastic screen protector that has no halo effect compared to a glass screen protector, but has a halo effect.  
Yes.  It works fine as a kickstand but for holding the phone in portrait, it folds out just beyond perpendicular so that it slides off your fingers.  The texture of the case is easier to hold than the bare phone though.  I'm sure that's true for a lot of cases.  I had the old HTC evo, and I've been searching for a kickstand to help with holding the phone every since.
Gear s2 for me as well. Fantastic piece of kit.
Let me know if it helps. I was trying to keep from having to do that until the Marshmallow update,  but it's getting ridiculous.
Is it possible that you have a case with a magnet in it? I've read some issues online with certain cases that mess with the S Pen if there's a magnet to wake/sleep the device.
Tried that. It pulsates, shows the screen that instructs you to pass it over the reader but it does not do anything. Tried it again today at a grocery store and got another dumb look by the cashier lol. 
I tried not using a case but its too slippery and my palm kept accidentally touching the screen, making it mostly unusable.
My Samsung Pay is broken. I'm stuck in a loop trying to setup the new PIN. It says, Opening Secure Keypad. and then nothing.I've tried everything short of factory resetting.
Xposed and a custom kernel is what I've done so far. I flashed a rom but it didn't compliment TouchWiz so I went back to stock. Stock with wanam xposed is pretty damn dope! Arter kernel for my money! 
Yep. Dozens of apps disabled. It's mentally taxing to have to wonder if it will go into deep sleep today. Sometimes it gets stuck with some wake locks that won't let it sleep and the battery melts away. 
Check for a software update, I'm on Sprint and just got one yesterday that contains a fix for improved battery life
Thanks, I was worried and also why is android systems taking up a chunk of my battery?
I have no idea how people get these numbers, i do everything you would think to get better battery life and i barely use my phone but i still struggle to get 3hrs 30mins
I can confirm that the Noble kernel causes reboots. I also had a weird issue with Samsung Gear VR suddenly opening and killing my USB connection. But I flashed another kernel over it -one made by a guy called arter97- and then flashed the Darthstalker ROM: no dropped calls, and averaging 1hours of SOT. Rooting this phone has been the best decision ever.
You should try turning off LTE and checking your speeds, sometimes that particular band becomes congested and 4G (HSPA) actually is the quicker option. I wouldn't blame the phone though.
I don't put it in to flight mode or battery save mode.  I have the screen more than bright enough than I need indoors,  it's not all the way down. I use either WiFi or mobile all the time.  I've made functionality sacrifices. 
I just got my note 5 today, registered for all of them. I had already received a free wireless charging pad for registering my old galaxy s6 edge with samsung pay lets hope these go through as well :) For sure i'll get the netflix and the 5dollar rebate though im sure
It's the interior grill for removing condensation on the windshield of a car
well that was fun but where the hell were MY earbuds when I unboxed mine?  Damn you Verizon!!
Onenote works great with the s-pen. You won't have any issues.
I second the first case. I have a love hate relationship with it because amazon's charging cables won't fit, but I love it besides that. It is very good and comfortable, but it is really difficult to get off. 
Nothing I can think of off the bat, any way she could get a replacement?
Bought mine at best buy on Verizon, got free wireless charger same time.
Call Wells Fargo and tell them you want Samsung Pay support. Also tweeting them is a good idea.
Go to Samsung Pay with NFC turned off and if you look at the status bar, the NFC logo will appear. I have used Samsung Pay with NFC before it just hasn't been working for me for the past week or so.
I think they used glass to discourage people from servicing their own batteries.
As a heads up, that ebay deal is for an international version. No US warranty, and no Samsung Pay.
I used it to start playing music whenever I got in my car using bluetooth near on my old phone, using Spotify if I had 4G and playing local files if I didn't. Haven't set anything up on my Note 5 though.
People just need to understand that there are so many android phones. I'd argue that there are 100+ android phone models released worldwide each year. Xposed, rooting, flashing roms, wiping, whatever, are all dependent on the device and software. I wouldn't say that people are intentionally spreading misinformation, but there is just so much to android, that there will be limitless experiences across the board. 
It probably was, definitely is on a Note 4 and I think it's built into Android for its lock screen (my Nexus 6 and I think 4 did that), but with Samsung's lock screen for the 5, it's not there AFAIK.
Google Now. I was using the TouchWiz launcher but ugh, those folders. So disgusting.
When I'm sleeping or at work. I only turn it on at work when I know I won't need to do much but make phone calls or text .
I ended up getting this for about $15 off Amazon, along with a $5 generic glass screen protector:http://www.spigen.com/products/galaxy-note-5-case-neo-hybrid-crystal?variant=4118414273 I also picked up an Aukey Quickcharge 2.car charger for $6 and home charger for $7, also from Amazon.
Do u have a choice whether to get the update or not like iphones?
Nice, I did this with my iphone 4 back in the day. Although I had to buy a replacement back from ebay. Same effect
The phone doesn't exactly need it, battery life is manageable without disabling. People are never happy though, even if we ever get to week long battery life there will always be those people who will post screen shots of everything they disabled to get 1 week + 1 day. There's a few people on this sub that disable even the s-pen features, keep their brightness on low, disable lte. At that point they should stick with a flip phone. 
I uninstalled the apk that I had sideloaded.. And downloaded the official from the play Store. But this is what I get when I try to open it. http://imgur.com/tZvdMJHhttp://imgur.com/NZwiH6aI don't know.. But it may be because I had also sideloaded the pay framework also. But it won't let me uninstall that....  :-/ http://imgur.com/EoRIBrG
This is happening to my wife on her S6 Edge. I haven't had the issue on my Note 5
Maybe if i hit the lotto ill go caseless. The only time i took my s6 edge or my note 5 out of the case is when i have it firmly in my hands over the bed or something.
For the front-facing camera- holding up your hand during selfies will activate a timer to capture the photo.  I think that's pretty cool.
Sigh... Yeah. I should have known better than to hand it to someone drunk, so I blame myself just as much. I'm really lucky that it's only over the back button and barely on the screen, so most of the time I barely notice it. But when I do notice it, man is it frustrating. Always taken pride in never having a cracked phone.
I hope it works my battery is awful
The cable is terrible. I recommend the 6' or 15' cable from monoprice. As long as I'm using the fast charge adapter, they both work very well. 
Under applications / Google play services, Manage storage then delete data.. Reboot 
I have about 2apps downloaded and maybe 15pictures or sohttp://i.imgur.com/ao8iH90.jpg
Tried the stylus from Note 3. Works when undocked, not while docked. 
There is already a known and very simple solution found with a simple Google search to remove a stuck S-Pen.http://9to5google.com/2015/08/25/explained-heres-exactly-what-happens-when-the-note-5s-s-pen-is-put-in-backwards-teardown/https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/3ir9jn/how_to_safely_get_the_note_5_s_pen_out/
Oh, maybe you had these kinds of gloves that have conductive thread on the fingertips. I have a pair like these, but they won't cut it when it's any colder than -10??C or when I'm skiing.
Mine is doing the same thing. Did you have their insurance or did they just do it for you? I so have Verizon 
Hit the menu button to toggle between pages.What's the name for that button now that it's dedicated to closing apps?
I think the dimming of the screen outweighs the constant polling of the light sensor, but I'm not certain. I definitely prefer it to Android's auto-brightness.
Worst case scenario, download the stock firmware from samfirmware and flash it through odin 
Ignore the message about not being compatible. Manually enter your product number and imei (or serial, Can't remember which) and it will work fine. Make sure your phone is in download mode and just leave it connected. Kies will do its thing. 
You could just flash the update yourself in odin.. There are plenty of instructions to be found on XDA if you search. Edit: spelling
I'm with many of the other folks here and can say the 6P gives me waaaayy better battery life. I'm a heavy user and away from a charger pretty much all day and the Note 5 had me carrying an external charger in my bag every single day and hooking up whenever I could. I easily make it through a day on the 6P. 
I kind of had the same dilemma, as the 6P was announced at the same time I was looking at the note 5.  But price for features wise, the note 5 wins any day. Better screen, the S-Pen, better design Imo. The list goes on. I don't hate the 6P, if it was ??10cheaper I'd have one no doubt. But it's just too expensive relative to the market. Its top end price with no standout features. 
Is that a fast wireless charger and a standard one?
Mine has slowed down. I've only had it for a month now and I turned on and off app optimization and now all of a sudden my phone is lagging up a storm.I even restarted my phone and it is still lagging.Also, the battery isn't lasting. I had it on for 2 hours and it went from 10to 75%. I think that is more android though than the note. I say that cause Gmail is taking up 15% battery since then.
For my 2 cents... a Note 4 user turned me on to the following method, and it's been a game-changer:S Pen --&gt [Air Command]--&gt Smart SelectI used to Screenshot the Home+Power method, but then I had to  crop it, delete original, etc. *(marking place on long mp3's/podcasts) It may take that extra step to extract the pen, but I find this method to be the most efficient for me
I dropped mine last night off a table about 1 meter high onto pavement. One minor heart attack later my Note 5 is fine with 2 markets on the left hand side of the metal top and bottom corners, otherwise no damage. Oh and also there is no case on mine, tired a couple but they all make it to bulky and none feel as good the device itself!
Loving the note 5, with the latest update it's been butter smooth. Works great, and the feature set, wireless charging, Samsung pay, amazing camera, are all really good. Only thing I would have liked to have on it is an ir blaster to use it as a universal remote.Coming from iphone&gtnexus4&gtnexus5&gtnote5I've had it about 2 months now I was really apprehensive of touchwiz and Samsung software, but other than small things overall it works really well and is unobtrusive. Not that far away from my previous stock Android experience on the nexus5.No regrets at all, best phone I've had by far.
And yet in your comment you never mentioned that.  All you said was a capacitive sensor. So by your first comment your wrong. 
You arent getting CM anytime soon because of the processor they are using.
Sprint phones have GSM rsdios, I don't know why everyone here is being negative. You'd have to look up specifically what bands your carrier uses and the phone has, but as long as it is truly unlocked and not just 'no contract' you should be fine. 
The dark material theme works pretty nicely with the screen and is a closer match visually to your Google apps.
I know what you shouldn't do first!  DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT PUT THE S-PEN IN BACKWARDS!
That sounds exactly like my issues with mine.  Getting voicemails but not showing any missed calls.  Dropping calls in places that never had signal issues.  Network connectivity issues when I was showing 3 to 4 bars of LTE. Returned mine after 1days to T-mobile.  The replacement is working great.  No issues so far, but I'm not holding my breath.  
With light that dim, don't expect a miracle, the samsung camera app is probably doing heavy noise filtering which would makes thing look blurry/plastickyDoesn't the Nexus 5 have laser autofocus? which would not be light level dependent and thus faster in low light.Does the Note 5 focus much faster in bright daylight?
Yes thats how mine looks, and thats how it looked for the charge pad
I'd like to know this as well. My battery seems to drain too fast.
Are you using it for navigation? If not I would switch to to GPS only and see if it helps. That's if you need it on at all
I like it on Google Now will usually have navigation ready for places I searched for, will tell me how long it will take me to get to work based on current traffic conditions, etc. It's nice.I will say my biggest gripe about it is the god damned battery drain.I have absolutely no paranoia about this. Google can see everything you search for and do your location data should only be a concern if you plan on committing a crime because a court order could have that data pulled. And no, I don't think this is the same as if you have nothing to hide, then you have nothing to fear. I mean. where the hell are you going that you don't want Google to have a log of it that nobody ever looks at? I went to work, grocery store, home, gas station, dunkin donuts. I swiped my credit card at most of those places so somebody knows I went there anyway. If I plan on robbing Dunkin Donuts I'll be sure to leave my phone at home.
If it still don't show up download gsam battery.
I usually use nova launcher, but since touch wiz seemed okay and has themes(coming from a note 3), I'm currently trying out touch wiz.... Wonder if that is the problem, but even it's own s health widget doesn't update..... Weird
It is really addicting! For Google, have the swipe action set to 'Search' under Nova Actions rather than launching an app or having it set to Google Now. Counterintuitive but it works on mine
It also could have been a fluke, lol, normally my battery isn't the greatest, but it just kept holding on yesterday. Like actively using the phone is fine but standby seems to kill it. Right now I'm at 64% after 8 hours with 2 hours screen on time. 
Running into the exact same issue.EDIT: For me, the issue was resolved by switching off wifi and onto 4G
Last night, I flashed Darthstalker and this morning I had an issue where the phone stopped fast charging and had a problem being recognized as a device by the computer. From what I could gather, it had something to do with an app called VR Gear (it's a Samsung app). So I switched to Dr. Ketan. I can't say with certainty it happened because of Darthstalker. But it's already happened to me twice with Darthstalker. If you want a Darthstalker-like experience, go with Hyperdrive. It's flawless and I experienced zero bugs. Just my two cents...
I have the gold as well, put a super thin/slim clear case on it.  Keeps the look but ads a tad bit of protection and helps with fingerprints. 
I've no suggestions for root-like apps, but that app confuses me: my AT&ampT Note 5 has a setting under Display to determine when/if/how long the touch keys light up (I keep mine off all the time), not sure if that setting is missing from other carrier-branded N5s, though.
Zooper with a custom clock I made. Saw something similar to it on /r/androidtheming and had a go at it.
In case some of you are thinking why you would need an app to change the button lights, it's because some variants have that option disabled. I had the button back light duration setting on my Verizon note 4,but it's gone in the Verizon note 5.
Take a look at his, you'll see that he's got one of them enabled, the first one I noticed was Verify Apps by USB. That seems to be the only one that's enabled. I'm not sure if that's the default or not, but I'm assuming that most of those are disabled by default, as they're specifically developer options (for a reason).
Yep.  I didn't use any special settings what so ever. 
Is this only for Verizon or can T-Mobile customers come play too? I want a wireless pad. Need to sign up for anything before I install Samsung Pay?

Scroll effects, grid sizes, and some other features like those are separated out for app drawer and home screens, but there's a separate look and feel section for the major aesthetic changes. 
In all honesty, look into setting up an insurance claim.  You can take it to a repair shop but they aren't always legit, nor is their work that good.
That's not gonna give my phone a virus or anything will it?...sorry, not too great with tech.
Cable from your S4 isn't made for fast charging.  Your phone saying slow charging? I almost can guarantee it's the USB cable that is bad that came with your note 5. Mine was fine in beginning too. Changed USB cable and problem went away but make sure the cable is capable of fast charging. 
Here's [mine.](http://imgur.com/JlhtPsa)Just picked up my note 5 and havent had time to make a new zooper clock.  Using 1weathers widget at the moment with nova launcher, stealth icon pack and random image I grabbed off google.Anyone know where to get a good spotify replacement widget?  Really want a transparent option for it.
What's your screen on time look like though. That's amazing.
IIRC, you can still use Google Maps with location reporting disabled. It just takes a little longer to get a location fix. I think location reporting uses wifi networks to help pinpoint your location faster. Not sure about Google Now, though. I think you have to have location reporting enabled to get location-specific content.
Yup, every Canadian carrier except for Wind Mobile got the update! I just referenced Telus because that's the network my Note 5 is on. 
I just got a new Note 5 last Friday and Android System was using 40% of my battery life and cell standby about 20%. That was overnight with zero actual use. I tried disabling location services, a factory reset, and did a full restore with Samsung Smart Switch but absolutely nothing would fix it. My previous Note 5 was getting 6.5 hours of screen on time this one just 2-3 hours with very light use. I went ahead and exchanged it to see if it will help any but I've only had my new one for a few hours.
You just have to drag about half and inch...  There's a vibration if it worked!
I've used the commuter cases on several phones. They are not too bulky. I have a Caseology case on my phone right now and it added very little bulk or weight but I don't believe is as protective as the Otterbox. On thing I will say about the Caseology case, it is attractive. If your phone gets tossed around a lot then I would go with the commuter, but that is my preference. Otterbox also makes a one-piece symmetry line that is lighter still, but does so at the expense of the durability and protective quality that Otterbox is know for. Keep in mind that if you purchase from Amazon* returns are very easy.

Most apps that require these permissions are using the data for anonymous analytics. That being said, if it seems sketchy, it probably is. You'll probably be fine so long as you don't go installing a bunch of junk apps.
Wait we can use the fingerprint scanner to log into Web pages? 
Try sidesync and thank me later
1. Depends on model. In the US the T-Mobile and Sprint models can be rooted and Rom'd. Keep in mind that the only root method available will trip Knox and permanently disable Samsung Pay. There's no way around that yet.  2. Xposed does work but you'd have to check with the various mod documents to see how support is. 3. I don't really dislike anything about the device except that it's slippery. I've eliminated some of that with d-brand carbon fiber skin. I'm also slightly annoyed because Samsung seems to be sitting on their hands when it comes to bringing more banks on board for Samsung Pay. That's not really a problem with the phone itself though. 
Spigen Slim Armor (Slate) with the black Note 5. Love the kickstand, adds tons of functionality. 
You can buy a replacement S-Pen for it from eBay
It's been my must-have app for the last 5 years. I use it to toggle WiFi on and off when I'm out of the house, mute sounds when I open the camera app (turns off the shutter noise which startles my baby!) and text my wife when I'm on my way home. There's so many cool things it can do. 
Seriously. I hardly ever use my headphones but I use my auxiliary cable multiple times a day. It resets the volume every single time! This has easily been the one (Although small) gripe I have had with the phone. 
I just got the note 5 today and if it can get the stand by time my nexus5 got with doze then omg! 0-1% per hour if it was a bad signal. Sometimes the whole night would be a 0% drop.
Not to my knowledge.  How are you planning on interacting with your phone with the screen off?  The volume can be changed without unlocking the phone virtually anything else requires the screen to be on.
I was going to hold out for the 6p but when this went on sale for $5with 2 year contract, I jumped on the n5. Prior i had a n3 with cm and swore off Tw, but i themed my N5 and its beautiful  (dark theme from theme store), super smooth and battery surprisingly  is good.  I honestly felt like i was going to regret this buy but its the complete opposite.  
Thanks for the feedback. I have edge now , so using samsung pay already and its very convenient. When you say you can disable bloatware you mean using package disabler? SOT of 4-8 hrs is unheard of for me, I get barely 2 hrs if lucky. The main reason I am ditching s6 is battery life, never had such crappy one. Wanted to go 6p but then getting a good deal with ntoe 5 so thought of jumping ship.
no warranty on international ones
The employees at the Samsung Experience Shop can plug a device into the computer and the software on the computer will tell it if there is an update available or not. The problem with this is that it only checks your software against the software on the computer, instead of what's actually available through the carrier.It goes like this:    Carrier pushes out update over-the-air -&gt Samsung Experience Shop gets the update about a week or two laterIf you go to the shop in between that, the OTA update will be newer than what is currently at the Samsung shop, and therefore plugging your device into the computer at the Samsung shop will read as up-to-date despite the fact that there is a newer update floating over the air. Or if you already have the latest OTA and go to a shop that doesn't have the latest OTA, it'll throw error messages at the employees at the shop.So the employee may be right in telling you that your phone is up to date, but only because he goes by what the computer tells him, which may not be as up-to-date as you want it to be (or that is should be). If he happens to be one of those that don't keep up on the latest goings on in the Samsung world, he may not have been aware that there is a newer update that a carrier just released.Sadly this means you'll have to wait a week or two before heading back to the shop to see if there is newer software that's been loaded onto the computers there.
Depends on the theme. If it's one of the ones with an animated waterfall wallpaper or something, that'll drain some battery.
I did when I was using the stock app,  but I've found textra has no noticeable slowdown. Google messenger seemed pretty good too,  but I didn't use that as long as textra 
Sorry to necro the post but what screen protector were you using with your note 5?
Note 4 and 5 come with a fast charger. 
He already ripped it out and broke the sensor.  O.P. Should file insurance claim if you want phone fixed
Hmm you're right :/ I'm not even sure what that keyboard is (the one I pointed you to), I don't like it.
i have this case, different color. Dropped it a few times so there is road rash around the boarders but my phone is fine. I didn't drop it hard once and my s pen flew out and broke which kinda sucked but i still trust this case fully. 
Where did you find those sounds? 
Tried both pretty extensively, before buying my Note 5 a couple weeks back. I have no regrets to be honest, if anything, my 6P owner friends dig Note 5's camera and design much more. Personally, I went with Note 5 because I loved the idea of having a stylus - admittedly I didn't use it as much as I thought I would. But all being said, I believe Note 5 is a superior, all rounder device. 
Yeah, it's unfortunate. Again, I really like the hardware and build quality of the note. The display is great as well. I just can't stand the software anymore.
Yes mine too but i can only smell it if I hold the spen by my nose
Sounds like Package Disabler. How did you test it?
I came from a OnePlus One two and I had 7 roms with multirom on my phone and I was ight. Switched to the note 5 after never owning a Samsung device and I'm not really missing anything. TouchWiz is fine to me with action launcher 3 and few xposed mods. Material design theme gives me that stock Android feel. 
I agree with you about nova launcher and also the icon/wallpaper theming that nova opens one too. The theming that Samsung provides is pretty weak though but better than nothing I suppose. I wish they made it possible to create my own theme with darker notification tiles or transparency but sadly, not the case. I hate knowing that the customization of the soft keys functions exist but I can't access it. Also wish for widgets on the lockscreen or at least some added functionality there. Either way, thanks for your insight and I completely agree with you.
android file transfer has a file size limit and I was not able to find a reliable way to transfer files between the two without using an app that is completely bloated with other crap that I didn't want. The best way I have been able to find to transfer files is transfer whatever I need to usb hard drive and connect that usb hard drive/stick to the phone via usb otg cable or use windows in boot camp. Neither are simple solutions but they get the job done.
Games and other big apps get put in there. Well not put in there but they store stuff in some way so that it adds to misc files and not the app size listed in app info.
Alright, i dont have a carrier/SIM yet, so the phones are the same then?
As far as I know no Spotify and Google Music both have the same controls on the lock screen
I downloaded a few font packs so I'm not sure which one it is,  but here's what I have installedClean fonts,  round fonts,  font bundle 1 and font bundle 5Check the play store descriptions to see which it is
The top left corner where the 3 lined button is located for slide-from-left menu becomes unresponsive for all the apps. I started noticing this frequently too. Next time it happens, i will uninstall facebook messenger
So I sent messages to support at both slickwraps and dbrand asking what their best options were for no slip wraps. dbrand never got back to me but slickwraps replied and suggested their alligator leather wraps because, in the opinion of the support person, it is almost like a raincoat texture. Edit: dbrand finally replied to my inquiry to let me know that all of their skins are made from the same 3M vinyl so they are almost indistinguishable grip wise.
or maybe even restoring to factory settings, wiping cache, and updating?
Apparently it can screw with radio signal
Useless list for note 5. Only one is a fast charger and it's the Choetech that everyone already knows about. 
I have an Original Pebble that I like a lot, but am looking to upgrade sometime. The Pebble Time is a great value right now, but if you're looking for something that has Android Wear and is a bit more stylish I would recommend looking into the Fossil Q Founder. 
My father in law did, but I haven't yet. I filled out his weeks after mine but he won the race. Contacted Samsung support on Twitter and they told me to contact prizelogic
Damn I'm sorry. I can't get any either cause they require a card activated on Samsung pay and I use Compass bank... it's not supported
Still, I'm a bit disappointed. (Only battery life side) Coming from a S3. The Note 5 easily lasts through a day, but I expected a bit more. I always have all features on, though. Action Launcher with widgets and location history always running, Bluetooth always connected to my watch and Unified Remote running in the background.
I've had the drainage problem with almost no packages disabled (just very basic stuff like Microsoft word, excel, facebook, instagram).  Disabling more packages seemed to fix it, haven't had the problem since. 
Sounds like he was trying to make some extra commission by selling you a few charger cables
I don't think that's the fast charger though I just ordered this one Samsung Fast Charge Qi Wireless Charging Pad - Black https://www.amazon.com/dp/B012AWBN9C/ref=cm_sw_r_em_awd_X8SAwbDTZZRJM
Because they felt fingerprint was cooler? I dunno. It didn't work that well on my S4 because sufficient lighting had a big effect on its success. Least that was my experience when trying to use it.
Just checked swipe and it doesn't seem like it does emojis. I would recommend swiftkey keyboard. You can long press the enter button in that one to get to the emojis. You can also theme it and have it learn from your texts and emails and such. Really good keyboard. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.touchtype.swiftkey
Where is galaxy market and galaxy gifts? 
You need to export the slow motion video by selecting the portion of the video you want in slow motion and saving the product as a separate video file.
100% normal. Linux, and by extension, Android will use as much available RAM as possible for caching file system stuff as well as applications you use more often, etc... It does this so that they launch faster and your phone feels smoother. The moment that the phone attempts to allocate more RAM than is available, it will start using the RAM that it is using as a cache. In other words, unused RAM is wasted RAM and seeing it using a lot even if you aren't doing anything is a good thing. When you try doing something that needs more RAM, the OS knows that the cached data is available to use and will do so if needed. Do not use any sort of cleaner apps or anything like that, don't worry about it and just let the operating system do it's thing.
Yes, it came out a couple days ago.  Battery life seems to (maybe) slightly improved.  Hard to tell so far.
I'm paying $28/mo for the phone, insurance etc for 18 months. I can then outright buy the phone for $167 if I choose to.
you can group message on android or am i missing something?
Could you crop his screenshot to show the part you mentioned?
iOS doesn't bit battery like Android and you're talking about a 72and 1080p screen vs 2k with stupidly high brightness.
Keep me updated when you receive it. Are you in the US? I want to order one but I'm worried about no warranty and no Samsung pay. 
I'm sure I'll enjoy it at first, my fear is how the device will age... Do you have any experience with aging with notes or galaxy devices? 
Sketchbook express is absolute shit. Try layerpaint or medibang paint. Also hear infinite painter is good to but looks too bloated for my needs.
I played around with my phone, best I can suggest, long press the number in call log, it chooses it for you, tap the option button, then hit share numberIt drops it in a text message, copy and past where needed
My spen gets loose all the time. In reality surprised because it never happened with my note 3
My battery life has been noticeably better since getting the update.  I used to hit about 70% (remaining) by noon (I usually am unplugged from 730-1200) but now I'm still in the mid 80s during that time. 
Try Settings &gt Battery &gt Optimizing: Detail &gt Turn off optimizing for any apps you want notifications from.Also, if you're rooted and/or using an app like Greenify, it can block notifications.
Once the wireless charger starts blinking blue, it is my understanding it will not start charging again unless you lift the phone off the charger.This is the same issue I also experienced with the Samsung Wireless Charging pad I purchased at Best Buy.  I would wake up in the morning and my phone would be between 7- 80%.
Nova is better in terms of speed and smoothness from my own use but the biggest benefit to TouchWiz is the nice widgets it provides. So I ultimately went back to TW after a couple days with Nova. 
I wish.  I'd love pattern or PIN as backup instead of password for fingerprint but for now there's no way AFAIK.
I figure something may be wrong, I heard the battery life was considerably better than what you are getting on the 6P. Right now I am averaging about 5 hours screen on time with 12-14 total on my Note 5 without disabling anything. I do optimize everything from the jump though but I don't turn off wifi or anything and brightness is set to auto.. Also that is on mobile.Edit: Down votes for the grammar or...?
This iteration of TouchWiz is actually pretty nice. The note 4 I didn't care for it at all, but they upped their game on this one 
Not at all, not that I've noticed. The phone is a beast and software like that can be easily run. 
Find the one reported WITH pictures without halo issue or try the one full edge to edge coverage with colored edges.I'm using a skinomi tech glass with halo,  i suspect it's an early flawed design since i picked it up on amazon fire sale for $1 a while back
Verizon phones don't come with the ear buds.  But the sound quality of the phone is pretty amazing
[Deleted] Edit: Sorry, active in too many subs. You kidding? This stuff is fun. I'm just enjoying learning about the weird random stuff tied to this phone. Shoulda asked Reddit about stuff like this a long time ago.
1. Speed.  On Sprint.  HTC One M7 only had 1 of the currently supported LTE bands (2 new ones came out after it was released) so the speed difference is crazy.  Not seeing 3g constantly is amazing.2.  Writing on the screen.  I thought it was going to be entirely a gimmick but it's pretty fun and actually really nice to use to navigate.
You probably just hided the messages contact, next time you get a text long press the notification (after you opened the phone) and turn the flip switch of Hide Content
Could it possibly be because there are more than one way, the way you have WATCHED? I did this and can say that is was fairly easy if you are patient and don't force it. I literally (I say literally, because I actually performed this task twice) heated the adhesive enough and used a suction cup. I lifted it a little on the glass closest to the bottom of the device and inserted my driver license. Don't you think you are overreacting? You are assuming a lot (that no one on here watched those videos, attempted this, or even owns the device). Do you own the Note 5? Have you done this to your Note 5? (You'd have to own it first). So I think you are overreacting, but we all have opinions and you REALLY think yours matters.  
I signed up for the charger on day 1 of the promo. Got my second 'backordered' email this morning, got a shipping confirmation this afternoon, and it was delivered (to a house across the street) when I got home from work. The mailman knocked on our door, told me there's a package for you across the street, was delivered by FedEx. I'm not legally allowed to move it to bring it to you, but you might want to go get it - Good guy mailman. Addressed to me, my name, my address. Not even close to the right house number (107 vs 74)
I'm not sure how to check if I have the international version but I believe I do. However in Israel I can't seem to find the app in the galaxy store and I didn't get an update to support the service.
Wow that's ridiculous. You ever get a message telling you that a particular app is draining the phone? I got that once or twice.Anyway I'll lose between 5-8% at night, if I'm not charging. 
Just got the Spigen air cushion.   I like slim cases, and the price was right ($15  at Amazon).   Have had it a week and am very happy so far. 
I never tried Google Earth on mobile (I don't have my Note 5 yet) but considering that the 3D cities in Google Maps on a PC feel slugish with an i7 at 4GHz, a GTX 76and 12GB of RAM, I wouldn't consider Google Maps / Earth performance as a relevent metric.
WOW. Messing with the settings did get it to work again! I specifically had to turn off:S Pen Power Saver Having this switched off allowed my S Pen to work again! Amazing! Thank you so much!!!
Everything is awesome! You might want to get an external SD card reader though... I have one and it really is a life saver if you want to take a lot of pictures/video and watch movies Amazon link: goo.gl/sn2bAE
I can't even find it in the play store. Nor does the link that's been going around work for me. Just says app not found.
Does samsung pay still work?
I have the same issue.  More so when the headphone wire brushes the screen it will act like a finger touch.  
It's because you're using a launcher and a third party weather widget.  The TouchWiz weather widget doesn't work with other launchers as far as I know. 
Huh, well, Ill look into a new cable first then I suppose.The battery dying at 30% has only happened once thus far, so hopefully it was just a fluke.Thanks!
WiFi from 8-12 and 1-5. 4G the rest, mostly for GPS and YouTube during lunch.
Open a credit card with Chase for use with Samsung Pay. Don't move your checking account for this.
I'd love to. I'm on my way home from work right now and can't type too much. But I'll message you when I get home. This was my first time rooting a device, and I could definitely offer you some advice.
I read somewhere that the case is slippery, something I want to avoid at all costs. I had a Zerolemon case for my S3 and it felt fine, with a nice non-slippery grip. Is it made from the same material as their older cases?
I've got WiFi calling and volte disabled and I've disabled a lot of bloat through package disabler pro.
Which widget are you using for the clock and icon packs? Can you help me setup mine like yours?
It's Zooper Widget + the Flat pack (on play store)
Yup.  I haven't received an approval email yet either and I submitted a claim on November 20th for level on holiday bundle.  
https://www.google.com/search?q=1440x2560+wallpaper
For pictures of subjects in low light environments, you can enable the torch instead of taking the picture with flash. This way the camera will capture more light from the surroundings. Typical use case: taking a picture of someone on top of a building at night. With flash the street lights below will not be visible. Without flash the person will appear as a shadow. With torch and no flash you get both.
Where did you get that wallpaper? I dig it. 
How do you get the app optimization? I'm on the latest software from sprint and I don't have it.
So unrooting your device (assuming you just reinstalled the OS using Odin?) worked and allowed Android Pay to work? 
You could always try another lockscreen. 
Nice, my record is 7 hrs 37m at 13% batt left.  Edit: 7 hrs 37m screen on time at 30% brightness. Was on reddit the entire time. ~14 hrs total on battery time.
Not on my t mobile note 5, only options are android and twitter
I RMA'd my stylus, two-day air on weds, they got it Friday, I got it the following Friday.
Oh my God, I thought I had to root to turn them off, but I didn't want to this time because I did not want to lose Samsung Pay and the stock camera quality. Thank you so much. 
I got my coupon and I just bought the Gear VR should be coming in soon inshallah
The phone is a beast no lags/ram issues so far and I've been getting great results on my battery life usually 5-6 hours SOT on my T-Mobile version if I'm using the phone a lot and the standby time is also good once you disable all the bloat/VoLTE/Wifi-Calling.
It's amazing. I sold my Nexus 5 and have gone from getting 1h screen on time a day and hitting battery saver mode by 2pm, to getting 2-3h SoT with a good 30-40% battery left over. I've downloaded and applied a free Material design theme as well as Google Now Launcher, and used Package Disabler Pro to get rid of some unwanted preinstalled applications like the duplicate calendar, email, etc. Overall, bloat doesn't seem as bad as what /r/android would have you think. There might occasionally be a bit of slowdown or frame dropping in the UI, but it's rare enough, and not dramatic enough to be worth caring about.The camera is excellent. It has a [focal length of about 28mm at f/1.9](http://i.imgur.com/RHlaEPA.jpg), and at least in daylight, is comparable to my micro 4/3 camera with professional glass, as long as you don't look at 100% crops. At 100% size, typical loss of detail from noise reduction and heavy sharpening is visible, just like with any other tiny sensor phone camera.Picture: [Side by side](http://i.imgur.com/J9PNsL8.jpg)Picture: [100% crops](http://i.imgur.com/oGtN2NM.jpg)Low light performance is quite good for a cellphone, thanks to the f/1.9 aperture and stabilization, but is [easily outperformed by a dedicated camera with a lens a full stop slower.](http://i.imgur.com/OFccVZn.jpg)Productivity wise, I use the phone daily to plan experiments and record research notes in the same way I'd normally use a paper notebook. Being able to embed photos and files into S-note is much more efficient than pasting things into a lab notebook and then typing it up later. It's enough of an improvement over a regular notebook that had I not bought the Note 5, I'd honestly consider buying a tablet with an active digitizer to use instead.
I'd assume so since the note 5 is pretty much the same phone and hardware as the s6, but I don't know as I don't own one. Check over at the T Mobile XDA Forums, if there is one it'll be stickied up at the top.And even if you do try to root it, it's nearly impossible to permabrick. Plug it into Smart Switch and you can reflash stock firmwares no problem.
Yeah my 3 chargers are spot on, every time. Ranging from cheapo chargers to official Samsung charger. 
The cable would look ugly but you could call it the diy battery case 
Just a quick update, I cleared my cache and reopened the app  just now and it worked.
cleared the cache on the samsung pay app?
mine gets better battery life than my s6 got, although at first i didnt use the pen its pretty fun to use when you get used to it
Material Design from the Galaxy theme store
I guess the battery life is relative depending on how you use it. I simply always find that iPhone lasts significantly longer than androids especially considering the much smaller batteries. The Note 5 simply doesn't last as long for me. And email app is pure preference.Thanks for the positive feedback!
Her Eric! Great review there, but unlike others I won't contradict you on the battery life topic, but instead tell you why you are getting that terrible battery life and how you can get the iPhone 6 destroying battery life performance. Samsung phones have arguably the best displays on the market (super amoled) but as you may or may not know, they consume somewhat more battery so try to keep brightness in auto at all times.Second, Android apps have a LOT more power in Android than in IOS, and this is a good and bad thing. Good, because it opens the door to incredibly powerful and useful apps like pushbullet and custom launchers, however, it's also a bad thing because it introduces more ways a device can perform worse. iOS ''s main strength is doing everything for the user and keeping him worry free by taking power from him, so you will have to learn quite a few things to get the full potential of Android, but once you do it you will understand just how much power can do for you.Now coming back to the battery issue,  go to settings &gt battery and see what apps are consuming the biggest amount of battery and try to either replacing them for a more power saving option or removing them completely. A big battery drainer right now is Facebook (shortened my old Moto X ''s battery life by 20% when installed), so remove it and install a lighter Facebook client like tinfoil for Facebook or Facebook lite, or just stick to the Web interface. Also, a big battery drainer is setting Google's location service to high accuracy,  so go to settings &gt location and switch it to power saving. Also, DON'T INSTALL cleaning apps or Antivirus apps, they aren't needed in Android, but in case you want to delete junk once every few months, try CCleaner (doesn't have any Spyware).I know this seems like a lot of work at first, but I hope you will soon understand the pros of having so much more power. Check out these apps if you don't believe me! Linkme: nova launcher, pushbullet, xender, fx file Explorer, relay for reddit, flynx, call recorder acr, keep Have a nice day! 
No it doesn't. Stop blindly attacking iOS. I'm a fan of Android, but even I understand that one of iOS's biggest advantages is giving apps and the user little power so they don't affect performance like they do in Android. 
Mine takes about 1 hr and 15 minutes. Using the charger and USB that came out of the box 
And this let's iOS have the amazing stability / battery life performance despite not packing the whooping 3000mah batteries Android phones have.  If there is one thing I don't do is shame features competitors obviously got right. I'm all for keeping services in the background, but it's obvious it's an issue for non tech savvy people. 
Well to be honest I know what nova launcher is and I would give it a shot but I actually really like TouchWiz for once. Especially after installing this material theme.My primary concern is battery life. How can I improve this?
I get about 98% with my fingerprint reader. The trick is when your are registering the fingerprints move your finger in every position you can instead of the same spot repeatedly. And register all of the slots. It will work a lot better. 
I've tried this over and over. Registered all the slots over and over. Rotated my fingers every which way meticulously. 
You'll need a tripod or something to hold your camera steady.I've only ever taken fireworks photos with a M43 camera, but the basic settings should be the same anyways.Use manual focus set to infinity and a shutter speed of 2-8 seconds or so. Aperture isn't adjustable and the sensor is tiny, so everything should be in focus at infinity. ISO can be set to a fairly low value, something like 5or 10would probably be fine, but I'm not sure how the Note 5's ISO settings compare to M43.
They only got it right though if you accept the compromise is worth it.  For many people it is, but for many it's not.Me, I'm willing to give up a little battery life for a more robust experience... but I understand that choice... not everyone does.Although, the reality is that I DON'T have to give up the power either: a little tweaking (sans root nowadays) goes a LONG way.  My Note 5 lasts me a FULL 24 hours of my normal use and I still have a good 50% or so left at that point most days.  Everyone is different obviously, but for me, it's great.
Do you maybe have a picture of how yours looks with the Zagg? I would like to try it but it is the costliest one
That's my experience too: this thing registers almost every time and almost instantly.  I can unlock with two fingers on each hand, no problem.Sounds like OP might have a defective device for sure.
That small compromise is far from the drastic battery life difference I got on my old Moto X 2 when I had power draining apps like Facebook installed. Truth is I'm not saying I prefer iOS even if I get more stability because I know my way around Android and how to not bog down its performance with useless apps, but I recognize this isn't for everyone,  and the negative impact a bad android user can have on the OS is drastically bigger than the one that occurs in iOS (that's why I'm avoiding blaming OP on the battery life they are getting, because it's not his fault, it's just one of the downsides of giving users power) 
Get Pocketcasts for podcasts. Available on both ios and Android and by far the best Podcaster I've used. Incredibly customizable and also easy to use and looks great. I use it to keep podcasts synced between whatever android phone I have at the time (currently Note 5) and my ipad. For a small one time charge, there's even a Web interface 
Well I got the bumper and by itself it looks awesome. But it doesn't go so well with the mahogany dbrand skin.    It's not a pure white and it's layered with grey so it's like grey-white-grey. It might look nice with a Titanium or black Titanium skin though. 
Yup, I agree.  Windows has a calibrator for the surface pro 2 which used the same pens.  I took the Feel apart and I took a spen apart, difference is the location of the sensor unit.  Full size pen items, the sensor is higher in the barrel which is what seems to be causing the issues, spen is lower, closer to the tip.  Precisely why if you hold the feel straight up and down, it's accurate, but hold it normally and it's not
I just got that exact same case 2 weeks ago, I had an Otterbox Symmetry and it was too slippery and bulky. I like the Neo Hybrid Crystal, it feels good in the hand and it looks great. I don't usually drop my phones so I don't need a crazy amount of protection. My girlfriend wants me to get her one for her S6.One that will provide more protection and the same sort of look (but is more expensive) is the Case Mate Naked Tough http://www.case-mate.com/products/clear-samsung-galaxy-note-5-naked-tough-case
So far, the response to my redemption attempts is receipt is too blurry when my receipt is a screenshot of my online purchase order.  Good to see at least a few people are getting approved.
Could always switch to a Nexus 6P, uses the Qualcomm 81 SoC which is supported by more ROM developers (correct me if I'm wrong). Since you're looking for custom ROMs, the S-Pen and other Samsung features would probably be rendered useless so you wouldn't be missing out with a 6P.
I didn't even know you could get quick charge speeds on wireless
Nope! Ugh. Verizon sucks. All I got was the phone, the fast charger, the sim tray opener, S Pen replacement nubs, and those user manuals that no one reads...
I use the vent mount.  It's solid. Was hauling some wood from home depot and it shifted and fell on the phone mount.  It held up great. I'm lucky it didn't break my vent.  Wireless charging works great too.  Slower than plugging it in but no problems for me.  If I really need to charge fast, I'll unplug the phone mount and plug the charger directly into my phone.  But the convenience of wireless charging is awesome.
Off topic. I have a N6 as well. What's your take on the ram management of the Note 5 vs the Nexus?
I'm using a Caseology Wavelength case with an iCarez glass screen protector. It works well. Only downside is that the glass is just raised enough to negate the raised lip around the case. But, I don't mind it since it's just a screen protector.
Can I get that wallpaper? 
One of the downsides for sure and the reason why the Samsung fast charger has a fan, it won't hurt anyone thing other than degrading your battery faster.
I gotta try the clearing of cache in recovery.  My battery drain at night is horrible.  Lost 22% last night crazy.  In comparison, my Moto X Pure dropped 2%Something is amiss with these phones for some of us.  Hope that MM fixes this up for us.
Not sure, it is brand new. At work I listen to Audible most of the day. At home I am on Reddit and Imgur quite a bit. http://imgur.com/gTf6eHChttp://imgur.com/pPZfou1I keep auto brightness on, WiFi off unless I am at home. Location is always on since I use Google maps fairly often. 
Yes, that is doable. Just skip the part where it asks for your Google account during setup. 
I have a ZAGG HD Glass.There is a halo, but, it's fine for me 'cause it is not noticeably intrusive while the screen is on. I got it for a really good deal, so I couldn't pass it up. I think a glass screen protector is worth it, because if it helps protect from one screen shatter, than you win. Plus I went with Zagg, 'cause I assumed they would have the best oleophobic protection (fingerprint smudges.)  
I haven't really noticed a drain on my battery. What do You use?
Playing on loudspeaker, the app does not close. But whenever I use Bluetooth or headphones, the problem occurs
Once you enter your pin or apply your fingerprint it should have a timer that swipes from left to right it gives you like 15 seconds or something. Chase card here, too. Been able to use it at every store I've tried it at so far. Good luck!
That's smart unlock. You must have set it up for when you're at home or connected to certain bluetooth device or something. It means the phone is unlocked, you can simply swipe anywhere else on the screen to open it. Touching the padlock actually locks the phone, hence you then need the fingerprint to unlock it again.
Your wife looks hot as shit so maybe don't give her an icon 
I had a regular s6 edge, loved it, switched to sprint to lower my bill and got a note5 for myself and my wife, I love it even more. I use the s pen way more than I ever used/noticed the edge screen. 
Any well rated quick charge 2.charger will work great.
I dont lose 5% but I do lose a few per hour. Marshmallow next month should fix that
I have an Aussie Note 5, yet to get that update!I have been an Android user from G1 days, only used 5s for a few months and got back to Android.In midst of all good things about Android, this is what I hate most. Every phone/ROM I have ever owned, there is always at least one basic functionality which you will struggle with, no matter whether it is an Octa core processor with 8 gig, or single core with 256meg.
I've heard there are lots of issues regarding connectivity and a weird notifications drop down with the s2? I really like the looks of it but those are two pretty big issues for me
I know this doesn't help but my mobile data randomly shuts off, then eventually my celluar connection fails.  I tried a new sim but it still shuts off until you restart it.  I'm about to take mine back to Verizon.  The only thing I might try is seeing if package disabled has anything to do with it.  But the fact that it only loses connection  everyother day probably indicates package disabled isn't the problem.
I ended up downloading glimpse notifications, shame screen wake isn't a default feature.
I rooted my phone and am getting over 15 hours of SOT. No way I'm unrooting this thing. The performance, too, has improved dramatically.
Do you mean like a full screen widget? 
I submitted mine on the 6th and received the promotional gift to best buy and the samsung store on the 15th.  
The Exynos processor in the Note5 do** throttle like the Snapdragon 81can. That's said, I haven't heard anyone complain about throttling on the Nexus 6P.
I have that same backgroud! For a second I was like wtf, how'd my home screen make it on reddit lol. Piss poor performance from the boys today though
Pretty good I'd say. The outer part of the casing is rubberised. The inner part is plastic. 
No what I linked was a pen size case that hold the note 2 spen. So it should work perfectly for what he's wanting.
What's the weather widget?
Oh, I'm fine with the black, and I keep mine in an otterbox anyway. But I listen to a lot of different music constantly converting FLAC files and shifting libraries around is irritating, and data pricing in Australia is quite depressing. If you're going to remove the microSD slot, you better damn well make sure all the carriers have the best storage options available.
If you're ok with colors and patterns (not actual pictures), check out Tapet.
I'm about 85% sure that there is an app that can toggle the hard key lights, I read about it in this sub.  You can also enable power saving mode which turns them off.  I also have read about the Verizon variant having battery issues but I cannot verify or debunk this claim.  My experience with battery life has been very unusual.  It's been fantastic except for 2 separate occasions  (I've had my Note since 11/20). One night I got really bad battery drain from Android System.  I opened package disabler pro and made a more aggressive list of packages to disable and restarted my phone.  All was good until a week later, I got severe battery drain from Android OS (Kernel).  I wiped cache and rebooted and it didn't help.   I tried re-enabling bloat and now my battery life is fantastic again.  Earlier today I was at 47% with 3h45m screen on time with 2hours since last charge.  I hope Marshmallow fixes the random battery drain issues, I know I've seen several other posts here about it.  It may also be a bug with one of the disabled packages because I haven't had it happen since re-enabling bloat.
1: If you're buying from a reputable store, you shouldn't have to inspect anything, just be mindful of their returns policy in a worst case scenario. 2: I'm using tempered glass on mine and have not noticed any weird effects. 3: My carrier didn't give me a choice but the dark blue that I received is bitching. Looks great, I almost don't want to use a case with it. It's a fantastic phone in every way, you won't regret it. 
Well to see if you're eligible for a promo go to it's website and check the fine print.  For the Holiday bundle with headphones, wireless charger, and battery bank the very first thing it says is *Must be 18+ &amp resident of 5US/DC or Puerto Rico.
I have the clear one and it looks really nice with my white note 5.  The little honeycomb details stand out a lot of people compliment it 
I have both the Note 4 and Note 5 and I love the Note 5 despite the loss of microSD and removable battery.  The Note 5 battery life is amazing and lasts all day so I only charge at night when I go to bed.  The few times I did a top off, usually in the car when I go to and from work, I have a QuickCharge 2.car charger so I easily get a lot of charge just from my short commutes.  The microSD card loss, I primarily stream my music (Google Play Music and Amazon Prime Music subscription plus Soundcloud streaming) and my photos and videos get uploaded to Google Photos and Amazon Cloud Drive (and clear most of them off local storage from my phone while keeping a few nice ones if I want to show them off).  32GB is plenty for me just for apps and I don't game on my phone.But what I love about the Note 5 has been using Samsung Pay with MST and writing on the screen while off when I want to take notes.  Those 2 alone are killer new features that are lacking on my Note 4.
Change your USB cable, so many of us have had bad ones that did same thing your describing. I think one's that come with phone are PoS. Changed mines few weeks ago never had issue again 
Just get it replaced from where you got it. Mine had a similar problem and my battery would die in about 3 hours 
I used Package Disabler Pro to disable all Samsung and Carrier bloatware. I also use Greenify to kill apps I'm not using so they don't run in the background. I turned off wifi calling and volte. I have my screen display on basic, and never leave location service, Bluetooth and WiFi on when I'm not using them. I also turned off automatic syncing.
Sketchbook pro. I have it and set it up on the spen launcher like he does. Too bad I can't draw like that. 
I agree it's way better in sunlight compare to my note 4. Samsung did piss me off about removing a feature the S-Pen had on the note 4 but overall the 5 is handsome down a better phone Imo 
It was on the screen and barely noticeable at all, but maybe it was just something on my screen because I haven't been able to find it again. Either way it's pretty tough and should hold up.
The problem with the Nokia charger is that it's only providing about 1/3rd of the juice as the newer chargers. I have 8 of then around my house,  and I love them,  but they're definitely getting outdated quickly. 
Both apps you wanna use have to support it ,if they do you hit the multitask button to open all the windows you have open and it should have a button next to the x that is two windows on top of each other once you press that it should let you open one app at the bottom or top than find the other window you want that supports multi task and also click the window icon and it should allow you to have both open 
Yea I'm really impressed with the quality. I also still prefer 1080p 60hz any day over the UHD video setting. When you pan around with UHD everything gets super blurry. Almost more than normal. It's weird. 
It's not the fastest for sure, but I'm still testing.  My plan is I have a [dual port (link)](http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00YX7Y3RW?psc=1&ampredirect=true&ampref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00) with the adaptive charging port open so I can connect a usb cord to my phone for fast charging if I really need it.  Haven't tested if the port makes a difference in wireless charging yet.  I haven't used it a ton as I'm still waiting for the low profile cord but just today I drove around for about 2minutes with the GPS running and it wirelessly charging and gained about 4%.  Not a lot but at least I'm not losing anything.Edit: Oh, and it was at 64% saying an hour till fully charged, not sure how accurate the estimate is
Hey I didn't get my S pen fixed at all but I did go to the AT&ampT store and they replaced it. So thank you all very much for your help.
&gt Get an exynos note 4 (the N910C works great on all ATT bands for example) and you're guaranteed to get note 5 TW roms ported over, especially since it has an unlocked bootloader.Counterpoint, get a Snapdragon Note 4 (unbranded or from a carrier that doesn't hate you) and you get to get rid of Touchwiz altogether.  My Note 4 performed worse than the S4 (running Google Edition software) it replaced until I switched it over to an AOSP ROM.  Samsung is not good at software.
Any other apps you know that are disabled automatically with package disabled pro? That are you know useful. 
Have you used Package Disabler Pro?  Changes the game in terms of battery life 
Open your phone app then go to contacts then pull up the menu and got to settings. Then should be the second option. Hold the back button for 2 vibrations to get the menu 
Will basic color mode help with battery life? Mine is still set on adaptive display and I'm mildly disappointed in how fast it's draining. (I came from a Droid Turbo so I'm spoiled but it's literally the only thing I don't adore about this phone!!) 
I think the N920g was supposed to represent all unlocked international variants. The worst I'm assuming is that yours will be delayed by a day or two at most.Did you get the update shown on this post?
I had this issue. I think it was because I set it to optimize battery for the Google keyboard app. Check to see if you did the same and if so, try turning off optimizations.
Damn. My battery sucks :(
Same here after the update.
Just got this today. Galaxy Note 5 Case , Dretal@ Ultra Thin Soft Case Slim Cover for Samsung Galaxy Note 5 (2015) (Soft-White) https://www.amazon.com/dp/B014LVDCAI/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_rgOxwb6XBCY6GBest case ever. I like the hard shell cases but the clear soft is slim, non-grippy, and has plugs for charge port and headphone port to keep dust out. 
This is the Indian variant, the N920g, which was shown in the leaked Samsung roadmap as the first device to get Marshmallow.
This happened to me. I was able to get the S-Pen out by removing the spring, sticking the top half back in to 'connect' the pieces and then pulling them out as one. It took a few tries, and was risky I suppose, but it worked.Bought a new SPen from eBay for about $20
Not on power saving mode. I really do not know what the problem is, tried uninstalling and re-installing the problem widget apps and still the same problem. 
Check to see if the Smart network switch option is ON.Settings &gt Wifi &gt More (up top on the right) &gt Smart network switch &gt off
read on some yhread once that snapchat doesn't use a camera? basically screenshots what in the viewfinder or whatever. not sure about the videos though
Maybe. But if your phone is in a case it's hard to notice. But if it isn't in a case my finger completely covers the speaker. 
Alright so you didn't give a lot of info here so I'm going to give every idea no matter how stupid it sounds.This is usually something you get when the specific image link is messed up, so if you have only seen this on a specific image or are able to open some images but not all then that may be the case.Otherwise, this is likely an app issue. I'm not sure which reddit app you are using ( I typically use Sync for Reddit or Reddit Relay) but I have seen instances before in which the app is updated and something gets wonky and imgur or gfy links just don't work for that version of the app so I would try a different Reddit app and see if the issue persists.If THAT doesn't work then I have never had a issue get past the previous stages but I would guess it could be a network issue.
Only some banks support the automatic transaction notification.  It's actually great for my Amex I get a message every time it's used, even if it's not on Samsung Pay now.
Plastic screen protectors are mostly garbage though. They prevent scratching( which isn't really a problem anyway) but are just slightly better than having nothing at all when it comes to fall damage.
Congratulations! As for tips to improve battery life, I myself keep every single app i have on  always optimizing just to make sure no app draw extra power, the battery life is outstanding, i sometimes reach 6 hours SOT, as for cool apps check out flipaclip, sketchbook, Gnotes, google keep, and for customization i am using nova launcher with whicons icons, and zooper widget, take your time to fiddle with the device, and enjoy!
I went from a 6 plus to the note 5, I second the smart switch app
Hold down the power button and the home button at the same time. There is also a way to do it with the S pen but not to sure on that
For all of you saying warranty. They will no longer fix or replace anything to do with the s pen under warranty.
Glad to hear I'm not the only one waiting. It's starting to seem like it's made up unfortunately. The fact that NOTHING new about it, not even a whisper or hint, makes me think it was... Well... Just a rumor. I'm probably going to get a Note 5 this weekend or early next week, I love my Note 3, I like the screensize and I use the stylus all the time (actually wore out two of them on my Note 3). I couldn't give up those things just for bump and water resistance. Extra battery life would be a plus, but not a deal breaker for me. Which way are you leaning? 
It's hard for me to reproduce the Note5 lock ups and stutters. There doesn't seem to be an obvious pattern. Sometimes the Note5 will have a huge amount of keyboard lag, and other times it works just fine. Keep in mind my N6 is on 6.0, I suppose there is a chance 6.smooths things out of the Note5, I won't hold my breath though. 
If you use Google play books, they have an option to change then background color to black. 
Do you think this would fix the Cell Standby battery drain bug? 
Where's the clock from?
I put nothing but tempered glass on my phones.. especially invisible shield.. lifetime warranty if you register them. 
As a delivery driver I use my GPS a lot. I just keep it on. I ain't skeerd. 
I flashed Dr. Ketan's ROM and I like it a lot. It gives you a lot of control over your phone. Like, for instance, there's even a toggle to choose between regular cable charging and fast charging. It's the tits, man.
It'll be the trash folder for ES file Explorer. Open up ES and you'll see a clean option on the hope screen, click that and it'll clear it. By default it stores anything you delete in the trash 
He basically said that the Note 5 was best for 2015 (in its category) / higher priced and large phone. 
Which version does it come enabled by default on? I know it wasn't on my tmo version.  While i love it (unlimited data plan), it would be insane for them to ship it on by default...
I got the matter white Dbrand and it's more sticky than the metal or other ones I've had as it's feels more like a standard sticker texture.
Why would you want that???But yes, you can. Long hold the home screen. At the bottom, three (or four) options appear, click Widgets and search for the Flipboard widget.
Do I hit send? Either way I get no WiFi in more settings.
No it is a different app store that may or may not come on your phone depending on your provider. http://blogs.blackberry.com/2014/06/amazon-appstore/ I actually disabled the amazon app store after i downloaded amazon underground as because amzon underground can act as the appstore and the shopping app.  You could try apk for the amazon app store then download underground. It sounds convoluted, but whatever works go for it.
You can't use Samsung pay, but you can use root cloak to use android pay
I used Samsung pay for the first time yesterday at a Walmart, the register lady looked at me funny and asked what I was doing. Told her I was paying with my phone but by that time the payment had processed already. That is sorcery right that, so cool.I had a case on mine and it worked fine.
I have been having that problem. I hope its a bug that can be fixed in Marshmallow.
Do you see the little S-Pen menu on the side? Might be a bad S-Pen sensor. Can you let us know what is checked on in the S-Pen settings? Even better if you can post a screenshot.
It came stock with my phone, it's under the app drawer. Which model do you have?
Yes, it uses Magnetic Secure Transmission (MST) which means you can use Tap and Pay at terminals without NFC. The banks are fairly limited at this point, but more are being added. 
Someone needs to be a guinea pig and try this on the Note 5 and see if there's offset from the tip to the sensor.  Most of the bigger ones have that, which is exactly what I'm trying to avoid.  Works great I'm sure on devices with larger sensors.  Tablets, etc.
I've had textra but it fucks up group chats &gt.&gt shame cause love how smooth it is. 
was this o nly done in 60fps or more?
Example website?edit: My phone app works fine as a windowed app and shows up in the multitasking list. What do you mean?
On mine, I select settings, then WiFi calling is near the top under connections 
Spigen Neo Hybrid Carbon in Slate is the best looking case if you have a Black Sapphire Note 5. The metallic black/blue on the sides look like an extension of the stock phone, the metal side buttons match the metal home button, and the carbon fiber looks and feels pretty cool. 
This was another selling point for me, now that you mention it. A friend demoed the last generation of Oculus VR for me and I could really see the potential. Can't wait to try out the Gear VR.
Did this as well and got a confirmation number. Got the 5to best buy today in email so maybe you will get something soon.  Also signed up for the 10to samsung and have received nothing so far. 
Likely cord especially if you are using same cord with different chargers. 
What is the theme? It looks great
Wait...I shouldn't let my battery drain to 0?
Try searching for waterproof case, there appear to be a few that is NOT a ziplock bags
I agree with you. With marshmallow coming I see them getting fingerprint support fast since they will have an api to use. Also the other issue with alternative lockscreens is no off screen memo support either and that's a big no no for me. 
&gt as there are settings you can turn off to kill the issue.Those tips are for idle drain, we're talking about something else. On my phone, if I go into battery stat, I see cell standby as #1 item, [like this](http://imgur.com/9EwX5tV). This is with screen on time of 54 minutes, so screen should have the biggest battery usage. Cell standby should be pretty low on the list. I have a Verizon Note 5. 
Awesome. 90% of the time i will be using OneNote on my workstation, but there is still a time I will be in the field and need to add or reference my notes.

Adguard
It's not covered under Samsung warranty.  They consider the S-Pen an accessory and refused to replace mine when this same thing happened.  I took it to both the Sprint store and contacted Samsung directly.
did it trip knox ?
I switched from a Note 5 to a 6P. The biggest issue for me was the bluetooth on mine was broke (seems like a hardware issue some people face. Range is about 1 ft with wifi connected, 1ft without. Can't go to Samsung since a friend dropped the phone and there's a small crack on the glass by the back button).But anyway, I really enjoyed both phones, but there were some odd software quirks on the Note, and I just really prefer stock when it comes to it, despite the S-Pen being awesome, and the note being overall the better phone. Better screen, better battery, better camera... But marginally in all aspects. The camera software is MUCH better on the Note, and the pictures are overall better. Is it a huge difference? Not really. And on some shots the 6P is better even. But overall I'd give the slight edge to the Note.
My bank doesn't support it either but they sent me a charger anyway.  I figured I'd sign up for the offer, what's the worst that could happen?
I haven't noticed a change in battery life since the update. 
so far so good! Loving it. Love the design tbh. Only thing is my battery life can be better, doesn??t compare to most power uses here. But probably cause I have everything switched on. Smart phones are meant to be smart. restricting functionality is pointless to me. 
Can confirm the Verizon Note 5 supports Samsung Pay and Android Pay.  Verizon did not give approval by launch time but approved it shortly after, I think it was within a week.
Irrelevant to the OP's comment.Samsung is now no longer warranting the S-Pen *at all*, which is terrible because it's still not an available accessory from their online store, you can only find what I imagine are factory seconds on Amazon and ebay.
Coming from a note 3 I find this phone is awesome. I never really swapped batteries anyhow and I opted for the 64 gig. That's sufficient for me.  The camera is great. Love this phone. 
It's a shame that the experience is that different from carrier to carrier.I bought my Note 5 from Telus here in Canada. First of all, there is no carrier bloatware on it (well, only the Telus account manager app which is fine by me). There is no alteration of any kind that I can see in the OS, no options have been removed, etc. It's seems to be a pretty much stock Note 5 ROM.Without disabling the location services, without using PDP, without going in any power saving feature or airplane mode, I consistently lose 5% overnight. I've been checking before going to bed and after, it's always 5%. Last night I lost 6%. Well that was because I slept 1hours so the overnight was longer. All in all, the battery is great for me.Meanwhile, the experience is much worse for some. :(
You can just minimize action memo the floating memo app. It will float around everywhere just tap it to open it, even with your finger
So you have more music than will fit on the phone? I'm currently using about 11g on my SD card. 
Ah yes forgot that one thanks. Although I did try my USAA AmEx and it didn't work. I'm assuming it has to be a straight up AmEx card.
I saw a post on this forum about an app called Package Disabler Pro. It literally disables all the rubbish bloat wear and helps with battery life and processing speed. It has the option to 'disable all bloat wear' i chose that option and soon realised some apps had disappeared like Facebook and One drive and a few others. All good though the GUI is pretty simple and it was easy to enable them again. Just takes a bit of time to work out what's going on and get your settings right. Still worth the $2
Keep your sd card in your s4 and download Samalsung smart switch on both phones via google play store. If you got the 32gb note 5 you will only truly have around 25 gigs of room.
If only Samsung Pay supported any banks. 
I'd argue it needs it. The software experience is miserable out of the box. 
Do you have any pictures of yours? It's tough to get real info on these things as it seems people are really on both ends of almost every protector. I've seen people say great no halo for some then have others post perfect installs with a definite halo effect.
Agree'd about Nova launcher. I wasn't happy with the performance of it on Note 5. I did like Google Now but again could feel a tad bit of lag sometimes, not all of the time though. TouchWiz has gotten a lot better over the years, I agree there as well.
i did and I got the update from the android store. There is a link floating around you can follow to have it show up too.
I'm using Spigen ultra hybrid. So far so good!

My stock Note 5 is exhibiting the same behavior. I have not really found any patterns. A reboot doesn't change anything. I tried emptying the Spotify cache nothing. At times, Spotify will play for hours. Other times I have to return to the app and press play to get the music going again after a few songs. This happens when listening via Bluetooth and the headphone jack. I don't really use the built-in speaker much so I haven't noticed it happening in that case. EDIT: Here's an alleged fix from /u/DeliciousDreamerClear cache, uninstall, download version 2.8.0.1064, turn off automatic updates. https://apkdot.com/apk/spotify-ltd/spotify-music/spotify-music-2-8-0-1064/
I am also curious what else you have disabled/enabled to get 1hr SoT. I get no where near that.I am rooted with Greenify, Amplify, and Powernap enabled and have disabled a ton of bloat getting between 5.5-7 hrs SoT. Google Now and location on.
You agree to a 2 year contract, and typically the carriers charge more per month on your service fees, which usually makes up for the large discount provided at the time of phone purchase.But if you can get in on deals like this, sometimes it makes it cheaper overall compared to buying it full price or doing an installment billing plan.
Twice - first time I fumbled and bounced it on the table. SPen popped out and didn't work properly after that. Ordered a new pen and an otterbox and later managed a spectacular flub where the phone flew across the floor and clattered in to the leg of my coffee table. Thanks to otterbox it was fine.  
Can I have one thanks lol. I tripped Knox on mine before I saw the promotion so I have to just stick to the Nexus orb. How fast does the Samsung one charge? 
For me, the issue of spotify closing at random appeared with the update that made it so that the music would not stop when unplugging headphones or getting a call. I think the issue is app related rather than phone related.I drive long distances on a regular basis and I always have Waze + Spotify active and from my experience I can confidently say spotify never once quit on me until the above mentioned update.
I've had some bad experiences with products' haloing around the curved edges the Note 4 and 5. I think it's why I can't use the plastic screen protector that comes with the Otterbox Defender. 
Get package disabler. A lot of what I've read says it's really just good for saving battery life, but I've noticed a lot less slowdown since I disabled all the bloatware. Also, google messenger just kinda sucks.
Get a new cable. Same thing happened to me and apparently the cable it comes with is really bad. I just got a new cable and use it with the charger the phone came with and it charges uber fast now.
Doesn't hurt to try.  I use a note 4 cable that I had and it works all the time.  However the original cord will work if you just plug and unplug until the charging notification says fast charging.
Reading your comments, just thought I'd throw in my .02. The XDA Debloater tool disables the Bloatware. it improved my battery. I know you said you don't care about the bloatware, but that is a plus.Also, (Coming from the LGG4) the RAM Management isn't as bad as people make it out to be. I don't think any other phone initially opens the app as fast as the note 5, but then again I have a weird habit of closing every app after I'm done using it.
Odin is actually used primarily to flash stock software.. There are links on XDA to websites that host stock Samsung software that can be flashed to locked Samsung devices.. Because the software is official and not modded it also does not void warrenty or flag your device.. This website describes it well and gives links... Find your phones forum on XDA and read everything you can related to flashing the update so that you won't mess it up.. Profit. 
I always thought the note 3 was the best note. It showed the biggest jump between any of the other notes, and was the first phone to offer tech not available in any other smartphone, such as 4k recording and USB 3.0. Also, it had the jump from 5.5 to a 5.7 inch 1080p display which is still the current size for the note 5. Almost forgot the addition of a physical thermometer and hydrometer which I thought was the shit showing people the current humidity and temperature in the room. Since I upgraded to the note 5, I miss not having cool features to show off to people anymore
Go to Settings, Lock Screen and Security, Show Content, then, I'm guessing, email. 
I've bought like 1cases and the spigen slim armor is the best.  The grip is by far the best of any case I've tried.
Wow! My record is 6hr 47min. Though I've only been getting 4.5 to 5 hrs recently. My usage Relay (reddit client), Google Play music, Internet, Google Plus, and Textra. Relay and Textra being what i use the most are set to completely black backgrounds.
Yep thats what I read sadly. It don't really bug me too much though. Sensors seem to be okay so i don't have too much to worry about. In most lighting conditions the scratches aren't really even noticeable.
The only option might be a wireless charger until that time. See if one of your friends has one or the local store has until the replacement arrives. Sorry to hear about the troubles 
Get the clear view case! It's pure class.
1) Get the Galaxy Gifts from the Galaxy Store. There are a lot of great apps and deals that are offered for free.2) Go to the Theme Store and get a Material design theme.3) Then get a case and a screen protector like /u/drage636 said4) Then get some nice apps from the Google Play Store:a) [EasyHome](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jamworks.easyhome) - This app makes you touch the home button rather that pressing it.b) [NoHeadsUp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jamworks.noheadsup) - Disables Lollipop headsup display notifications. You can configure a tiny notification ticker.c) [Package Disabler Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ospolice.packagedisablerpro) - Get rid of the bloatware.d) [Nova Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher) - Get the Nova launcher and get yourself a nice icon pack. It's customizable (with pro upgrade of course).5) Enjoy and good luck.
If you want some more fun customizing things on the Note, give Nova Launcher a try. 
Will the promotion work for those upgrading on a contract? 
My biggest tips is play with it as much as you can to see what thing change or effect the photo in what way. The 3 tools I may use in pro mode are iso, shutter speed and manual focus. But that's just me I'm not a professional photographer so I can't tell you what ever setting will but but I learned from just playing with it  
I think of myself as a heavy user. I owned a Note 4 before upgrading to the Note 5. I never got more than 4:30hr SOT on the Note 4 and it would always be a struggle to make it last by the end of the day. No such issues on Note 5 with the caveat that I am now running Ditto ROM with Skyhigh kernel. With this setup I get 7 hours SOT, 24 hours standby with no issues. On stock ROM i had a persistent android system wakelock that killed the battery in 12 hours. Not sure if it's my phone only or if this is a common issue. I have a N920c

If it helps, my stats at this exact moment are: Off charger for 8 hours 51 min, 58% battery, 2 hours 4min screen on time, estimated 12 hours of battery life remaining. Anecdotally, I have an office job that keeps me on the road from time to time. Only once have I worried about my Note making it through the day, and that was because I was somewhere that had almost no cell reception. But I was able to get to an outlet for 3minutes and, because of the fast charging, I ended up with more than enough juice. I have had to lean on Ultra Power Saving mode once or twice because of unusually long phone calls, but the fact that the mode exists is a bonus in my book. FWIW, my last two phones were the iPhone 5 and the Note 4, and if I had a choice I'd take the Note 5 with me no matter the situation. I haven't really missed the removable battery in the 4.Again, just my experience and two cents. Good luck with your decision!
Yes, I have Facebook disabled but use messenger. 
I'd thank you but my fingerprints are already registered. The phone randomly stops recognizing them. 
I left Verizon about 6 months ago and haven't looked back. I've had Verizon for about 8 years. They're the last to get anything, charge the most money and give you the least. Yea the coverage is stellar when compared to everyone else but in this case, I prefer quantity over quality. I moved to T-Mobile. I now have 4 phones for what I was paying for 3, we have 10GB/line (no sharing), an ADDITIONAL separate 7GB for Hotspot use and with everyone doing the lease thing, I get a new phone 3 times a year if I want....No catches. Best decision I've made in awhile. Sorry, didn't mean to get off topic. I just feel bad for VZ users when I see no root for VZ?.... No NFC Pay for VZ?.... 
I used to be in a similar boat. Literally owned almost everything in the mobile world since Android became a thing. My decision for my next phone will be forever tied in Samsung, thanks to Samsung Pay.
Screen burn is an issue on every oled screen. It's the main reason I've stayed away from them for so long. The only thing you can do is try and get it replaced at a carrier store/over the phone. 
Wireless Chargers: You can get a decent one off of Amazon for less than $15. It works well and my phone never gets too hot.  The Fast wireless charger from Samsung is $7and will charge from 0-10in just under 2 hours.  Headphones: Yes (although I think i heard that it doesn't with Verizon, for some reason.)It is a great phone and is by far the best I've owned.  Edit: [Link to wireless charger](http://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Yootech%C2%AE-Charging-Blackberry-Qi-Enabled/dp/B00NWMI07S)
Mine has always charged extremely slow when not using the Samsung charger and cable. ATT
I have done some research into how to improve battery life,  and as I type this I'm at 44% remaining,  with the phone having been on for 7 hours and 45 minutes.  I've got 4 hours and 25 minutes of screen-on time so far.  I should really make it to at least 6 to 7 hours. I've found that there are things you can disable with Package Disabler Pro that really help, as well as using Airplane Mode if you're somewhere that gets bad reception. Like for me,  at home I get zero reception,  so I turn on airplane mode,  and use only wifi.  If I'm going out and not gonna use wifi,  I turn that off. There are ways to automate it using tasker or other apps. I just do it by hand. But by far,  the most important thing is to disable your bloatware.
yeah, its the same in Australia. best chance to get a different colour is by importing through ebay and other websites. 
If you search for it in the playstore it doesn't come up for me. But this link works. Just when I install it gives me a fail error.
but on nexus devices you can also set a pin, for when your fingers are wet or something... no way to set a pin without excluding fingerprint?
I had an HTC One with GG4 and the screen never scratched. I abuse the shit out of phones. My Note 5 is without screen protector always, and only occasionally has a case on it. YMMV. 
Can't you just use Google wallet and tie that to your Chase card?
I really want to root my phone and don't care about Samsung pay. Can you give me clarification on warranty issues? Let's say my power button craps out and I need it fixed. Will Samsung check the knox counter for stuff like that?
You can run a Samsung theme on a nova launcher ? 
I've only ever accidentally done this with my Windows. Somehow I touch the upper left side and boom. Floating Windows/tiles. I've searched, and I've only found pressing and holding back button, but that was for previous note phones...anyone know what I'm doing to get floating Windows?
I have the same sku on wind, but I don't have this issue. Have you tried downloading while connected to a different wifi network? When does it happen? While downloading through the browser, or the play store, or everywhere? Does it only happen with large files or are small &lt1mb files similarly affected? 
I've had this problem, too. Download the app SoundAbout. It's pretty easy to learn. This might be fixed in the next update.
Used swift key in my previous phone but pleasantly surprised with how well the stock keyboard is working for me, so sticking with it for now.
I had considered power saving as an issue and turned it off for a couple days to see if it would fix the issue, but the lag when going home and hitting the multitasking button still happen.  Especially when I haven't cleared recent apps in the last day. Rooting might be the answer for all my issues, but I just can't bother with that. The phone doesn't do enough for me to warrant spending the time messing with all that. It was the same case with jailbreaking my iPhone.  Just ain't worth it. 
Click the back button.  Out the menu button to use the history arrows.
What's your screen on time?
Where does one get a cable specifically for fast charging?  I'm getting the same problem described by OP.  
I currently have the tmobile Note 5, running custom rom, unlocked bootloader and could have simply rooted it with a quick flash in Odin. T-Mobile has a better development community at the time. Either of those two are good to go, but I am already bored( i have issues with phones, lol) and have ordered the Nexus 6P.
My battery life is so amazing right now I dont want any sort of updates to mess that up.
Yeah I always turn off GPS unless I'm traveling 
I got my e-mail today as well! I purchased a Chromecast with it.
Keep in mind that the battery estimate is based on how you've used your phone over the past week. If you use your phone more heavily than your friend does his, yours will be lower. When I use my phone lightly, I get estimates of up to 6hours remaining, but if I binge watch video or play games, it'll drop to as little as 10,
I love the camera on this phone. 
When measured correctly it measures the exact time in between heart beats (called RR or interbeat intervals) and calculates the variability of those RR intervals over time.Certain HRV calculations correlate highly with autonomic nervous system activity which plays a direct role in just about every process in the body (including when you get sick - as you mentioned).
International ones don't have warranty in the US so that might be a reason for you to return it and get a US variant.
K well the home simple and example is all the same setup just showing different aspects of it. I do not use any type of theme. Home shows what happens when you tap the home icon in the bottom right corner visible in simple.Nova LauncherMoonshine icon pack for the pop up menuMin Icon pack for dock iconWallpaper is just an image I foundTrying to answer you best I can. 
The wired ones. The picture looks like wireless, but if you look closely you can see the wire. 
There's no way to do this (that I'm aware of) but when you step outside, it enables an outdoor mode automatically and brightens the screen. 
Happening to me as well. Battery drain is insane.. I really hope sprint fixes this soon
Does this only happen when the S Pen is detached? I ask because I have noticed that when the S Pen is pressing on the screen, finger input is not recognized.
This happens to me about 4 times a day. Super frustrating when I make about 3calls a day for work.
Anything you don't use really.  There's a debloat guide on xda that's been tossed around here that may help.  Also SOT varies based on brightness, idle time, what you're doing during the SOT, etc.
the fancier ones can often be more problematic. Thick plastic casing around the reader, physical sensors looking for a physical card, etc. The ones that work best for me just have a slender, naked slot.
Thanks.Any idea why the Authenticator would need disabling?Also, here's the WLD link: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2179651You install it and make sure USB Debugging is turned on for the Note5 and run the program.
No the quickest way is with the Powercharger provided in the box. The way I understand it is that if you have powersource A and powersource B, the larger of the two will charge the battery, not the combination of the two.
On most other devices I've pulled screens and backs off of the adhesive was always reusable,  it's some durable stuff and the heat from a dryer will get it tacky making for a nice seal again 
Pulls out S-pen, hovers bottom right corner, hover indicator disappears. That's it, phones broken!
No, the screen looks clear and focused when i take the picture.  I went into best buy yesterday and compared it against other Note 5's in the Samsung Store area.  And sure enough, my camera was noticeably worse than the other Note 5's.  Samsung Store rep even noticed how blurry my photos were using the same exact settings.  What the hell?  How can some come with a bad camera?  I need to take mine back to T-mobile and get a replacement now.  I could convince the Samsung rep, but not sure how much luck I'll have with the T-mobile store reps.  I fucking hate Samsung.  I had to replace two Note 3's because of proximity sensor issues, had nothing but issues with my Note 4, and my S6 was about the buggiest phone I'd ever used.  The Note 5 has been sooo damn good though.  Fantastic signal, battery life, responsiveness, no lag, just phenomenal especially compared to my S6.  Like in every way it is leaps and bounds better than the S6 that I can almost forgive Samsung for my crappy experieince, but now.... fuck it.
I am note sure if it was clear but the edge of the case cracked, not the phone itself. Either way you might be better off with another case.
As it starts with the letters ES, does it have anything to do with ES File Explorer? I have always used that even in the past and nothing like this happened before even on my Note 3
Haha no back button is one issue. It's all software driven and the back is on the top right corner. Most apps in order to go back, you basically have to start from scratch. There's nothing customizable about it. (You can make folders.....pppshhhh)  just the overall functionality of the phone is not intuitive. Want to delete a message?  Hit edit in the corner, select the message, then hit delete, then confirm. Android?  Push and hold, hit delete. Ffs. Cameras aren't as good as reviews say. Tap the screen and the phone sounds hollow. Can I also critique the sheer size of bezel to screen ratio? Or about how long it takes to charge? It was frustrating. If you adopted the iOS platform early on and got used to it, fine. If not? You'll hate the complexity of over simplification. 
Did you use S-Note for this beautifully masterpiece? 
Do you notice a big difference with Samsung package disabler or is it more for peace of mind to know that unnecessary things are not running in the background?
Can always try safe mode. 
I used a Tmo version with att. Worked fine, connected to LTE. You won't have the advanced menu that att phone comes with. Make sure your settings in mobile settings&gtnetwork mode are correct. Try putting your sim in a att phone or check your Imei... 
Have you checked to make sure that the setting for Screen off memo is on in your Settings? It should be in Settings &gt S Pen &gt Screen Off Memo.
When trying to use the actual card or using S-Pay? 
Here is your winning post from both subreddits. This was well thought out with valid points. All the posts on r/lgg4 were like lol Samsung is shit and sd card is God. The one guy over there tried to say some lumina phone was top tier over the Note 5. 
This happened to me yesterday. I was grading papers of my students and one sent in a PDF. I'm pretty sure the way around it is this:Go to SettingsApplicationsDefault ApplicationsFind Write on PDF when you see it, and press CLEARTry reopening the PDF that you've downloaded and choose Write on PDF when you see it. That should work. 
What's your reasoning for getting either the note 5 or edge +?  If you don't use the s-pen and could live without the screen of the edge, I'd recommend the new nexus. Better companies make those phones, and it won't be for another few months until we get 6.0, and if it's anything like the note 3 then the update will break some functions. But if you really want the pen or the beautiful screen then there's no better phone than these two. 
What brightness level do you have set most of the time?I had screen burn in on my note 3 from my GPS but it was pretty minimal and didnt show up until it was nearly 2 years old.
Nice, does Samsung pay/android pay work on that model too
I love Candy Crush. I had no idea I was a stereotype.
Does Qi mean it's a quick charge?
Front pocket, same place I've had multiple other devices with no issues.Samsung is replacing the screen for free, the service center I went to has had a couple other phones with the same issue. Glad it was actually hassle free... but it's pretty much like http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2287882
That's not what I'm referencing. I mean the display appears to have shifted upwards by maybe 5 pixels. There is now more black space at the bottom edge. Interestingly the lock screen is the same as before, but when I unlock I can suddenly see that 5-pixel-thick black space appear on the boytom
Ah ok didn't know that it worked well with the s pen. Thank you very much.
Sure, I'll try to be brief. The biggest selling point for me is he provides an alternative to having a heavily themed look. Stock for his ROM is a speed indicator ,signal bars, and status bar home button on the left end of the status bar. He also has 3inimt (sp?) battery mod to customize how your battery looks and potato clock to customize the clock. Even with no notifications it looks cluttered to me so he has a virgin mod that makes it look like stock touchwiz. He also includes modified launchers so you have whats called 6thgear which lets you pick any app for the left side swipe in, as opposed to be stuck with flipboard. So you could left side swipe in google search.Rom also comes with Dolby, Beats, and Viper sound mods baked in. I usually disable beats because currently it sounds terrible and run with Viper and Dolby.Has a pretty decent baked in tether mod.He also builds his flashable zips into the build, so in recovery, Mount System, then navigate to /System/Mods/ and that is there you find his various UI themes, various options for flashing xposed, reverting host files to stock, modified launchers and such. Performance is as expected, quicker than stock and the dev is pretty friendly and receptive to comments/issues. Will I say it's the best? Thats very subjective, I may have been on another Rom three versions ago and it changed considerably since then, I will say Tek HD is a mainstay for me.
I think even most DSLR would have trouble focusing in that kind of dim lighting wthout some sort of focus assist (IR or flash), much less a cellphone camera
I would agree with a tempered glass screen protector as well. I keep my phone bare, except for a dbrand skin. I regret not putting a screen protector on it as the oleophobic coating scratched very easily going in and out of my pocket.
There's a good chance it's trying to update a disabled app, but package disabler is blocking the updating process, and it just keeps on trying, hence the battery drain.
Thanks. However I was unable to find it on play store or even Google for that matter. Can you please share a link? 
My fast charger works really really well.  I left it at home one day and had to use the charger from my S4 - took 3 hours!
I managed to squeeze out 4.5, but that was mostly just watching a movie with doing nothing else at all
Any pics of the process?  Looks really slick!  I suppose the front glass would be the same?  I WANT A CLEAR PHONE! 
I purchased my Note 5 after breaking My Nexus 6.I can tell you whole heartedly that the only thing I miss was that extra .3 inches from my Nexus 6 on the screen.Besides that, there is absolutely no comparison. Better screen, WAY better camera, S-pen has found some use, better battery life, touch wiz shockingly for a change is actually very nice and is not a bother to use.I can't speak for the Nexus 6P but considering its still a phablet without a lot of the Phablet features i've come to love on my Note 5... I really can't see why anyone would juggle each one to figure out which to go with.
The S-Pen has had me tied to the Note for a while now. Pay is just icing on the cake. They could probably triple the Touchwiz memory footprint and I'd put up with it.
If it's the one I'm thinking of you should check it out. They do all sorts of old consoles and games like.
I just came from a 16gb iPhone 6. Never again will I buy a 16gb phone with unexpandable storage. However, 32gb is pretty decent. All of my music is on Spotify/Google Music and my entire photo library is on Google Photos. Currently have ~10gb of apps that are mostly games that I don't play, 3gb of movies/TV shows, and 500mb of camera photos. System storage takes up a whopping 7gb, so that still leaves me about ~12gb free.  
How are google apps handled on it.  For instance: when you use Google music, or use Google messenger,  etc. 
I had no idea double-tapping Home button opened the camera app before this post, but I love it.  Thank you!Edit: After posting this I realized it didn't help answer your question at all, lol, but still, thank you.  Have an upvote.
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*.

My last case (HTC One) was a Speck and I really liked it.   However, it was a real bear to get on and off the phone and the rubber would sometimes fold up under the edges of the case. Also, it seems like they have gotten a lot more popular, resulting in the prices of the latest ones being a lot higher than they used to be. 
Hi! If I may, are you connecting the phone through Smart Switch? Or just connecting as a media device and browsing through folders? Also, if you can see all the folders, search around in the DCIM folder for your videos.
Whatever dude. I don't care what people say about the phone. If I feel differently I can and will certainly say so. I disagree with OPs assessment of the display and the camera. I voiced that opinion. It's not my problem that you take issue with my opinion. Report me, downvote me, or whatever you feel the need to do. I'm done with you and this conversation. 
What are stylus apps? 
I can't really say if it was any one (or more) app(s). I followed the link that's been payed here to the thread about battery saving.  I just basically went down the list of disabled apps the OP posted and disabled the same apps as long as they didn't seem like something I was gonna use. The airplane mode really helped. Although, it is kind of unnecessary since I'm at home and can charge, but I really just wanted to test the effectiveness of it, and it proved valuable. So now I'm pretty aware if I'm in a dead zone. 
That's what I got when I bought my phone yesterday, the clear cover looks good with the black phone. The only drawback is I rest the bottom of my phone on my thumb and after a while the edge of the case seems to dent my thumb, lol. 
Showing free in my play store.
yea, We cant install it correctly until they push their update out that unlocks it for us
Don't forget that note 5 comes with the most amazing tech called samsung pay.
Also, call tech support. Maybe it's a router firmware issue? Some routers only allow so many devices to be connected to it. Maybe if you update the firmware it'll help?Also, try this. http://recomhub.com/blog/how-to-fix-samsung-galaxy-note-5-wifi-problem/
Just use Arter or Sky high (I believe). The author of Sky high (and noble) found a fix that should eventually be put into every custom kernel to prevent reboots.I would also recommend using the forum you got the files from for tech support. They are more intuned with whatever issues you may be having. Because truthfully most anyone that will help you here is just going to go there and pull the information.
Hate to bearer of bad news,  I am fairly sure that this will not happen.  T-Mobile,  or as mentioned. International version is pretty much your only shot.  The Note 4 for at&ampt took FOREVER.  Something like ten months. And that was done by a leak,  which doesn't happen often, If you can,  sale it,  or return it if root or ROMS are important to you.
You can download the app from the androidapk website, but unfortunately won't work unless your phone has been updated to support it. Only USA and South Korea phones allow it right now.I have sideloaded the app on my phone (canada) and as soon as I try to open it it says my phone needs an update, and a connection error before kicking me out of the app.
Doesn't changing the point types change the font? 
Nope.  Happens weather S Pen is in or out, and nowhere near the screen.  We'll see if the re-flash Samsung just did for me sticks.
I too started with Reddit is fun, and switched to relay as it looks cool. But I ve seen my data usage being so high since I'm on relay. Also slide for Reddit is one which I like
Looks like there's a share button onthe bottom left of my notes in S Note.  
Really? Every replacement I've seen has been less than $20
I took the phone off the charger a little before 8am, had a full day of school where I was constantly on youtube or reddit between classes.  Came home where I put it on airplane mode with BT off, Wifi on.  I get horrible cell reception at my house, so cell standby had been the biggest drain.  I learned to turn on Airplane mode while at home to combat that.  Then later in the night, I had hockey practice where I streamed music, 45 minutes each way, to the rink and back.  Got home around 11:3or so with some battery to spare, so I spent the last half hour or so  watching YouTube to try and drain it out as much as possible.  Got in bed around midnight with a couple percent remaining.  I'd say pretty good, considering I was actively trying to use up battery, knowing it was going to be a long day.
Best I've done before charging for the night is 39% left after 14 and 1/2 hours.Not bad.http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-cg6ghSepvK8/VoDXgSMYuWI/AAAAAAAASMc/U_w3Tpv7Gq4/s1600/Screenshot_2015-12-27-23-31-06.jpg
Ringke Fusion. I love the look, but the s pen is a bit hard to get out without using my fingernails. My other case is the Spigen Neo Hybrid Carbon. Not sure I would recommend it though. It's a bit bulky for my taste.
I'm stumped. Have you tried rebooting the phone? Maybe try toggling the screen off memo setting (from on to off to on again).
Wunderlist, Google Keep, and Any.do.lYou can't go wrong with any of these choices
It just takes some practice to get it right. As you use it more and more, you'll notice that some models of terminals have different sweet spots and some have more sensitive read heads than others. Once you start using it often, you'll be a pro at making MST payments.
No, not like Touchwiz does.  I use nova and Chronus for clock and weather on my home screen, but this is a common issue among OEMs where their widgets are not available for you to place on other launchers.
What about when you want to share *videos* with your significant other and dont want to bring youtube into the mix? 
Don't bother. $10-$15/mo. $10deductible. You have to ship the phone off for repair. You're better off self insuring and paying the $20out of pocket. 
Does this work if the pen is stuck the right way in? 
Looks like it might be just my car acting up then
Hmm, Samsung dropped so many features for premium materials and build that it sorta just feels like an iPhone running Android now... I've been with Sammy since the GS3 and always loved those extra features.
Same here... Just renewed my contract yesterday and got the black one, wohoo!
If you're using the default Samsung keyboard, go to settings, language and input, click Samsung keyboard, and scroll to the bottom to turn on [this setting](http://i.imgur.com/Vrs2imb.jpg). Then whenever you pull out your s pen that keyboard will pop up.
Light Flow app is your friend. Paid version gives you complete control of your status light and notifications and you can assign just about any color you want to any notification. It's really good for Samsung phones as the LED is a full RGB diode. Also each notification light will show up in the app and is actionable to clear it out. 
I've been an iPhone user for years , I tried the gs6 for 3 months and I can say the battery was worse than the worst iPhone ever , upgraded to the note5 and im loving it , give it some time and you'll get used to the size.
Wifi
I've noticed that happen with a few charger/cord combos. Sometimes just unplugging it 2-3 times will get the fast charging to kick in.I've had the battery thing happen also. It always seems like something I install or some update to an Android service  (play services, Google search app, play store, etc ). I was also at about 2hours after the upgrade to 5.1.1, but average right around 10-11 hours at best.Occasionally,  ive gotten a cache wipe (app and phone) to help. Hate to say it, but the only full proof way I've found to fix it is a full wipe and restore.
I really wish I could figure this out. My T-mobile is the same way. I have a couple friends with the Note 5 and say it gets amazing battery life. Mine struggles to go 1hours with only an hour and 15 minutes with the screen on. 
Are you sure it's not working and it just takes a very long time to load? I have an issue when watching videos and the phone takes about 2 minutes for it to begin playing and then after that it plays the whole video just fine. 
Yes. ~6 hours of SOT and no more reboots on calls. No more lag either. 
You can always get another phone app on the Play store. 
I wouldn't say tons of things have changed. It's a modicum of the Lollipop base. Samsung Pay is essentially just an app with some baked framework. Not a big deal. The new Google requirements aren't a big deal either. Not for Samsung, at least. What the carriers decide to do is a different story. Regardless, I am pretty sure the Note5 will be running Marshmallow before the Note6 is released. 
And? A piece of cello tape will cover it. You can either keep buying styluses, stop losing them, or just cover the hole. 
I currently have the G3 and Note 5 so its a sort of close comparison. I do honestly believe the G4 is not good enough to upgrade from the G3, the changes are too small IMO and has added too much bulk in the bezels. Its a good phone but not much better than a G3.For me I never really bothered with swapping batteries but did use my SD for music.  T Mobile started music freedom and I dropped my SD for Spotify. So if you want to listen to music locally vs. streaming is something to consider.Personally what I miss the most is the IR blaster, my A/C worked with it and it was amazing. But my BF can still use his phone for me :) Although I would miss the fingerprint scanner more than I miss the IR blaster. The raw performance and S Pen are also a major factor and what sells me on the Note 5 the most. The LG G4, LG G3, and Note 5 I have are all QHD and beautiful, but the Note has the best display by a large margin IMO. The same goes with the cameras. Neither have stereo sound unfortunately but the G4/G3 do have a nice loud single driver. The Note 5 has a heartbreakingly tinny and quiet speaker that is terrible coming from the Nexus 6.G4 Pros: Durability, Storage for local music/media, IR Blaster, Battery Life, SpeakerNote 5 Pros: Power, S Pen, Camera, Screen, Slimmer OS, Fingerprint Scanner. I pick the Note 5, but I already have the G3. But even if I didn't, I'd still pick the Note.Edit: btw, both the G4 and Note have multiwindow iircc
Spigen liquid crystal sounds like a good bet. I posted some photos here : https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxynote5/comments/3mni99/can_anyone_share_pictures_of_your_case_andor_skin/
Damn it, I was expecting to see pictures where you had done the same except you coated the inside of the glass with a silver film to literally make it a mirror. 
Mostly naked here!  Only thing I use is a tech 21 impact Shield I got from the T-mobile store.So far pretty good, no scratches.  Just an unholy amount of finger prints, though.I do keep the phone in a different pocket from my keys, just in case.
Couldn't agree more, if I was not as careful as I am I wouldnt be getting 4 hours of screen time. I was really looking in to the 6s plus but I have always been on android. I might wait and see what the 7 brings, the note 5 still is an upgrade from my last phone.
I could never get used to Samsung's keyboard. I keep trying to use it because I like the numeric row at the top. The spellchecking is horrible. I've been using google's keyboard because it remembers my words pretty well. Swiftkey is also very good IMO.
no i've tried everything. even did a factory reset. i haven't done the sim swap so keep me posted if it works. i've been using the same sim for 3+ years so maybe it is the problem (hopefully).
What brand are you using and how does the S pen work with it? Do you notice drag or any marks in the plastic? 
Same here. Loving the display more than anything 
I sideloaded my Samsung Pay Framework and also get an error installing the VZW Framework now. However when I open Samsung Pay, it says I need a system update for the phone, but when it searches one, none are found. Perhaps Verizon is going to push out a system update for people who may have sideloaded the Samsung Pay Framework?Otherwise I may do a factory reset tonight :(
Just curious, do you have the Google Now launcher and/or have location history on? With my location history enabled, my battery seems to crash way more quickly compared to when I have it disabled. And my Android System usage appears higher as well, but hard to compare that since my usage isn't exactly the same.
In all the times I've used the smart manager to clear RAM, I've never seen more than about 1.8gb free. No idea what is using so much. Having said that, I haven't noticed any lag on mine yet. 
I just used Odin to install the stock firmware for my specific phone, should I follow this part of the video? https://youtu.be/RRzIvcJDyEA?t=3m43s - Phone is working fine now just wondering if I need to follow this step.
Take phone back then, if you tried another fast charging cable without any luck. 
Which is why extended batteries are the cheapest solution. Unfortunately Note 5 doesn't have removable battery. 
I don't like anime but can still recognize that's great looking
I hate to be unhelpful, but I'm not even going to try to install a theme :)  I love Nova as-is.I do suspect that themes would work just fine though because I can change the systemwide font and it affects Nova and everything else pretty seamlessly.
This is due to the fact that QI charging is not very efficient. The heating happens due to the loss of energy. You should be fine. But if your phone is hot enough to hurt you, it's likely hurting your phone too. But if it is just very warm. 
If it gets stuck without you inserting it backwards it means the spring mechanism in the actual pen is broken.
Also not sure if this has been addressed, but did they remove the ability to manage background apps? Any advice on a different method that I can use?
Glad to have helped put! I love the gloop pen, and there are so many texture options to play with she'll have a blast!!
Samsung Clear View case -- little protection, but it looks **dope!**
do you lose any native Note 5 capability if you replace touchwiz with Nova?
Holy shit I came from iPhone 6 plus thinking Vain Glory was an iOS exclusive.   Thanks dude,  I'll try the spen with it too!
did you activate samsung pay yet? They occasionally have promos for activating Samsung pay if you haven't already done so. I am getting a free GearVR from that.
I just chatted with B&ampH customer service (also selling N920G) and they said it DOES support Samsung Pay... Are they wrong or am I missing something here?
Honestly your concern is not one that should be or is dealbreaking for most people. It comes down to software and, perhaps even more importantly, looks and feel. Even with Doze on the 6P, the Note 5 on Lollipop gets comparable battery life for most users - so that's not too big of a concern. Different software experiences and physical looks are.My recommendation is to go into a store and play around with the Note 5. Touchwiz really is not awful, especially with custom launchers. It even has some awesome features like multitasking stock won't. If you find yourself liking it, get it. You can always (hopefully) return it for a 6P - I personally like the Note better than the 6P, which my brother uses.
I would get white because fingerprints don't show up as much as blue
Just get one of [these](http://www.amazon.com/Dash-Micro-MicroSD-Android-USB-MicroUSB/dp/B00R0ZAMTM/ref=sr_1_3?s=electronics&ampie=UTF8&ampqid=1450819309&ampsr=1-3&ampkeywords=otg+micro+sd) and a micro sd card.  Its the size of a nickel, comes with a case that holds it securely which you can put on your keychain, and a micro usb to usb adapter so you can connect it to a computer.  
As far as settings I don't know if a way. If you didn't want to use it you could just use a different charger. But I honestly don't know why you wouldn't want to use it. 
I get the same battery life as you unfortunately ):
I haven't used a case or a screen protector in over 5 years with numerous slams, drops and slides across concrete and charcoal rooftops with very minor scratches on cheap plastic framing and no scratches whatsoever on the screen. I wouldn't bother with a screen protector unless you come into contact with sand.[EDIT] From 3 years ago from an older Gorilla Glass technology, including an EXACTO KNIFE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhoF564nJ_Q
Went from the s4 to the note5 a month ago. Get ready to be super impressed if you do. The battery and SD issue u isn't going to be a problem for me atleast. I have everything on it for the most part already and I have like 4freaking gigs left (I bought the 64 gig version) all my photos go to Google photos when I get home and I just delete the ones I don't absolutely need on my phone. 
No effect on my battery life from what I've noticed. 
What theme is that?
Delete any Facebook relayed app or atleast greenify them and watch your battery improve. I don't know what it is about Facebook apps that make them drain so much battery 
I use iSyncr to sync with iTunes
I've had it since launch and this is the first phone I've had in awhile that I love.  Camera is top notch,  battery life and performance are great, and believe it or not I actually like the new version of TouchWiz (never thought I'd ever say that either).  I especially enjoy the ability to answer a call or respond to a text directly from the notification pop up at the top of the screen. And wireless charging is a must have for me
I would imagine it's a feature of the email app itself, but I dont know which one you're using. Look in the features for that app, and for each email account specifically. 
Screen size, SoC, construction, limited to TMobile JoD phones. Still love the phone though. Excellent.
Edit: obviously it's possible that it won't, but I'd give it a 95% chance of getting it. Especially because it has 4gbs of ram. 
UAG cases are nice and its protected mine from drops already.  Less bulky and less ugly than otterbox IMO.As for app space, with cloud as your data you won't have issue with either variant unless your app drawer looks like the play store vomited.
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ospolice.packagedisablerproThat's probably the best way to get rid of the bloat. Take a look at a free app called greenify you can use that to disable and keep disabled apps you aren't currently using so they aren't running in the background. Try to keep your screen brightness at about 10% when you're indoors. The phone also has a power savings mode that underclocks your phone so it's using less power. Unless you're playing a demanding game you probably won't notice any difference in performance with it on. 
Unfortunately it won't work at all with my gloves on, while I can use my mother's S4 with them without any problem.
he got prompted for an update 3 times
How common is the stutter.. I have noticed a lot of people taking about. Also my edge had to low brightness  on auto brightness... Is that the case with note too?  What's the battery life like? 
This is in reference to the wireless charger promo samsung was running if you activated a card on samsung pay, it seemed it was taking awhile and alot of people hadn't heard when they would get the charger, (me included) came home today with this on my doorstep
Mediaserver scans your phone for files on it. I'm not sure about this, but probably there is a corrupted file inside your sd that makes mediaserver scan it over and over and keeps failing.Or probably there is an app using the mediaserver more than it should.What you can do, delete suspecious files or apps.. As last thing to do, get your important files and factory reset.
Media works fine, ringtone does not. If I have my phone locked and I want to transition from Ringtone to vibrate, and I have no music playing and no headphones inserted, I cannot seem to edit my ringtone volume.
The cable that you got with the phone is problematic. Try switching the cables and you'll see. They give a terrible cable with the phone.
http://imgur.com/gallery/tOhMm8R that's nova launcher, smpl blue theme, background from Google search for black background and chronus widget http://imgur.com/oypz1UG is my other screen with all my daily use icons some of which are hidden folders if you swipe up..e.g. Tapping Facebook icon launches facebook, swiping up opens a folder with all social media programs. 
I'm confused though. Most retailers are switching to the new slot style chip card terminals. Does that make samsung pay useless at the new terminals?

Wanted silver in 64. Ended up with a gold 32 from noel leeming after not finding one. Have photos backing up to google photos and hope i dont run into space problems.The gold doesnt look as bad as i thought once its out of the shops and in normal daylight
Flatty icon pack 
Yeah but if you have 2apps each taking 0.5% battery thats still 10%. It adds up and over this month just all my extra apps I've added really seems to have impacted my battery, tinder seems to be the biggest offender.
Battery life has been impressive. Slight stain on standby but nothing crazy like my Moto X Pure which I switched back from even after Doze. I was getting 5 hrs SOT before I tried out the Pure. People cry about the RAM bit whatever Samsung did to optimize the battery, it's working.
100% agree with this. I got a dbrand skin but also wanted some added protection to my phone since I'm clumsy and tend to drop it more than I'd like to admit.     It's very slim (only the top and bottom back part is elevated so the back won't touch any flat surface).     Would recommend. 
Love it:Qi-infinity&amp#8482 Wireless Car Charger Dockhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N4H1R1M/ref=cm_sw_r_other_awd_aKnHwbAGCX7NT
It's not a fast charging pad or cable.
download OS monitor, find out which app is running in the background sucking up CPU cycles, fix or uninstall that app.GSAM battery monitor and the built in battery tool can also help tell you what app/service is sucking up battery, but OS monitor would be real timeLast resort is to factory reset, then install apps one by one waiting between app install at least 1 day to see which app is causing trouble.
To play devil's advocate here, the Note series is originally for power users so naturally should be able to withstand a day of power use.  I can go two days on a charge without power saving mode mostly because I use other devices for notes and games and stuff and use my phone as a phone.However I will say if Samsung doesn't screw the pooch on the Marshmallow update, this phone could be incredible - look at some of the boosts people are seeing on the Nexus devices.
what did you signal bars look like?  if it was 2 bars or less, it could have been your phone looking for stronger cell towers, that will DESTROY a battery.   Other than that, I can't think of anything that would drain it that hard.
Oh. That's just a boot animation. Skins are generally considered to be like TouchWiz, HTC Sense, etc. 
Are you just using the Samsung music player? A lot of the players in The Play Store allow you to manually select a folder to use instead of just looking for it in the default music folder. 
Glass screen protector. Try it
A cool trick is that if you take the S-Pen out when the phone is locked, you're able to jot down a note on the screen, then when you put the pen back in, the screen automatically locks and the note is saved.Also whatever you do, don't put the pen in backwards.
Install Nova launcher, grab a theme you like from the Samsung theme store (I like material) and enjoy an absolutely beautiful phone! 
Look through everything you disabled - did you disable any dependent apps?  Tough to tell you what you disabled without seeing the list of what you disabled.
I got lucky and got the 64 for 15bucks at best buy two days ago. The 32 is 5bucks. 2 year upgrade. 
Small but annoying things I hope they change:- move close all to the top in the app switcher so it can no longer be tapped by mistake when trying to hit one of the capacitative buttons or home button- a data toggle in the quick menuAnyone has any idea if these are in mm touchwiz ?
I can tell the difference between the two TBH.  Not earth shattering different but you see it on curves and letters.  I'd rather have the 2k and a 4k battery with less/no bloat.
You can download music onto the phone through Google play. No data issue. Apple music was just released on android as well. Updates vary like you said. Sorry,  very tough to say,  and timing varies by carrier. Smart switch - couldn't be easier to use to synch contacts. Never used Knox,  sorry 
Same here. But honestly I would prefer they expedite a marshmallow release
Yep. The icons, settings, quick settings etc all stay themed. 
not to sound rude but the first line if my post says I've spent the last hour searching the galaxy app store and play store. so yes I have and is frustrating that they took it out.  
Here is the link directly to the apk on Google Playhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsung.android.spay
Battery is meh, on my 2nd one due to screen issues. Third will be needed soon.
I am so sorry you had to FDR. The Uninstall Updates should only show on the app itself, never in framework. Framework is a core function and the updates are not meant to be uninstalled. I'd love to follow up on the chat issue though. We have chat agents trained on Samsung Pay and have several who are dedicated to its support. Can you let me know when you chatted approximately, and the name you used? I can pull the chat up an do some work on improving the experience for others. I'm working to understand the little idiosyncrasies that previous sideloading has on the proper function after install from Play Store. We'll keep an eye out on the boards here and the r/SamsungPay board as well. Let me know if you run into any other issues. 
Textra actually does something to get rid of this lag. I remember reading about it and will try to find out more and link it in a bit. The keyboard lag is real though, Hangouts is rough. I've only ever seen it on Sammy's phones and almost always with Google Keyboard. 
Mobile payments at the remaining 90% of RETAILERS in the US that don't(and won't) support NFC. You can wave it over the magnetic strip reader and buy things. ??It thinks you swiped a card. ?? A form of host card emulation that doesn't need NFC
I thought about it. Not going to though for a couple of reasons:* The physical size of the Note 5 is just about perfect to me. The 6P is a bit taller and I don't think I'd like that. * Benchmarks show the Note 5 faster in most tests and the memory tech Samsung uses I think is a big advantage. * I don't love the fingerprint scanner on the back, though ironically I prefer no physical home button. * While I don't use the pen or split screen all that often they're features that sometimes come in very handy and I'd rather not do without them. * I likes me some wireless charging! Cables are so yesterday. * I actually like a lot of the tweaks Samsung does to Android. I've got a Nexus 7 and I love it but I definitely find myself missing some of the things on my Note 5.* The Samsung camera app is the shit. There's some good third-party cameras that can almost match it, but I still prefer Sammy's. * While it's nice to get quick updates on a Nexus device, Samsung (and T-Mobile in my case) hasn't been bad for my last few Samsung devices. I can live with some delay (I give it about two months from AOSP release before I start bitching). So yeah, the 6P looks like a perfectly fine device but I'm sticking with my Note 5.
Yes. It allows you to disable functions not listed in the application manager. 
Serious request: if you have time and the means, can you post more pics with better lighting and details and eliminate the glare?
I have the same exact problem you are facing at my brothers house. I can connect to his wifi but I get no connectivity whatsoever. It just comes to a complete stop. He has Comcast and I've tried to connect to both 2.4 &amp 5ghz, no dice. My gf and brother both have iPhones and have no problems. This has only happened at my brothers house though, on multiple occasions. I haven't had a problem on the wifi at my home or other places I've tried.  I didn't try to troubleshoot since it's only a problem when I'm over there, but it would drive me crazy to be in your situation.  Maybe it's a problem with routers that operate on both those frequencies?
Microsoft used to give away storage like free candy, so I don't blame him. I actually use it myself. 
Between 5h and 6h over 2hours with moderate to heavy usage with screen brightness set to 40% auto. Also I never go under 20% and I dont use any battery saving app or tricks. Yesterday: http://i.imgur.com/vfgZV5B.jpghttp://i.imgur.com/ZAIBOwl.jpghttp://i.imgur.com/IgdNZce.jpgwith 1 hour of gaming and 1:3of youtube streaming through LTE. 
Did you have the same carrier before? I've yet to drop a call on my N5 att. I will say that SIM cards on my old phones have smoked themselves, if I started dropping calls me frequently, I'd get a new SIM and voila, issue would lessen. 
I got mine from herehttp://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/231734163858UK stock only took a few days, it's from the UAE and works with all 3 4g bands.   I wanted the 64gb model with there being no sd cardGreat phone, I went from a 3 the 5.  Took a little while to like it, but camera, quick charge and wireless charge plus battery life have sold it for me
Damn I didn't think my bank (pnc) would ever get samsung pay and I rooted my phone yesterday and triggered KNOX. Oh well I guess.
My Rogers note 5 did a factory reset by itself after I updated to OK5(new firmware) I'm glad I did a backup first and was able to restore it
Why not just keep your wifi off if you are not using it?
Can't they just curve the glass slightly?
I got this based on reviews and hate it so much.  The edges of the case somehow manage to be even more slippery and hard to grip than the phone.  The back looks like it should have good grip but it actually doesn't.  Also the case was damn near impossible to remove from my phone once it was on.
You need an AC router with 5ghz wifi band! 
I had noticed things were laggy for me when I used Nova Launcher  (free), so I disabled it. Maybe that's it? Not everyone has this problem, and I loved Nova for the 12 hours I got to use it.
I just ordered the white note 5 :) 
Ebay, it was new and it came with a charger that doesn't even work with US outlets. The seller included a wireless charger for me , so I am using that for now. I ordered a fast charging adapter just in case if I want to charge super fast.
Is this compatible with Google cardboard? 
If you manage not to hit the glass front or glass back, the 700series aluminum should hold up pretty good - but it's a tiny portion of the phone. Yeah, the glass is Gorilla Glass 4, but it's still not made to withstand any kind of high drop.
It has a very nice design, the front bezel has a little metal edge so that the screen doesn't touch the ground when it is laid flat. The major point of weakness is the back. The sides are shorter than the all glass back so if you drop it on its back you are very likely to crack it. I'll never understand what people have against removable plastic backs. Yes they look cheap but so does a dented metal back or a cracked glass one. I'm still not sure I wouldn't be better off with the note 4, but I found a good deal on the note 5 and now have gotten used to samsung pay or I'd probably have returned it. 
I think it may be very similar to this one: Galaxy Note 5 Case, SUPCASE Water Resistant Full-body Rugged Case https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013D32WVA/ref=cm_sw_r_other_awd_289twbKV662ABI purchased this case, and it's worked very well. It isn't as bulky as an Otterbox, but provides great protection with a built in screen protector. It also has three different color backs to change out. 
18 minutes ago, you say the pen is using an EM field. 3 minutes later, you tell me I'm wrong for saying the exact same thing. Which is it? 
Google Keyboard is your friend. Great autocorrect &amp word prediction with swipe built in.
I have had no issues with battery life with the bloatware with that being said, the way they have connected certain features to apps it is best to get package Disabler Pro and research the bloatware you want to disable before you do so you don't want any adverse effects. Take your time you will be pleased with the results vs removing what others consider bloatware.
You can install Nova launcher and set certain gestures and inputs to launch certain apps.  For example,  swiping up with one finger on my home screen will launch Google Now.  Swiping down brings down the notification shade.  
Really looking forward to a fast charge version, will get a regular puck one for now and get a stand one when they start hitting the market.
I think just typing them out teaches the keyboard over time and you should be able to swipe them eventually. Don't think it takes long.
Yes the bamboo smart is the one I'll probably buy. The bamboo I was talking about having is a very old small tablet. Gonna try that stylus on the note first. The app that has calibration is layerpaint, it's a lot like paint tool sai. But my favorite right now is infinite painter.
Shame, seems like such a practical thing to have, but the other comment here might be right in that every interaction with the home screen needs an app. Will have a look at keep though, thanks. 
Unfortunately this charger is not a fast charger.  There is a fast wireless charger that is a different model though.
1. Sorry, I'm not familiar with those services. I'm a Pandora/Spotify kind of guy.2. You shouldn't worry about updates. You'll get them for at least two more Android versions. The phone shouldn't be outdated for a good three years if you're not a frequent switcher.3. Just store them in a cloud service. You probably already have a Google account so I'd use that.4. KNOX isn't worth the hassle. If you use Wallet it is already encrypted. You're not going to notice a big difference as long as you''re smart about the sites you visit and the apps you install. 
A Note 4 charger will work as it supports QuickCharge 2.or Samsung AFC.
Sucks you need to pay 5$ to unlock something as basic as notification counts. Considering it's basically standard these days, and touch wiz comes with it already.All the other stuff I can understand being premium options.
Maybe I just have bad luck, but while the Aukey chargers are great their cables do not have good mechanisms to hold the USB connector in the USB port. Comes out very very easily.
Hmm, its possible. Did you see the NFC icon in your notifications bar when you were attempting to pay? Mine pops on.
I had that issue but there were other factors like my hands were wet or a weird angle.. Its suppose to stop you from trying finger prints and force you to your back up after so many failed attempts. If you wait a few minutes though it goes back to accepting finger prints. Aside from my own user error its been spot on and ten times more useful than the one on my Note 4.
I've tried multiple routers, tried every possible thing, only the note 5 having internet speed issues, while the signal is full. I would take it for a repair, but its gonna take at least 2-4 weeks which is annoying..I use rooting for multiple things, but im not sure about rooting because of wifi issue, as if it stays, warranty would be lost, and would have to stay with this slow-ish wifi 
Question, I have Verizon and I have unlimited data. If I download the foxfi app, is there any chance they'll discontinue my unlimited data or do anything negative to me? Any help will be much appreciated
Yes please, where did you get that wallpaper?
At first I thought those were dealbreakers to me, especially in light of the fact that I just had to replace my battery in my Note 4 after a year of constant use.But I may be able to get past that if the battery life is reasonable out of the gate.As far as storage, I really don't see that being an issue any more.  I back everything up to the cloud these days.  The only thing I keep local to the device any more is music, and I may finally give that up and give in to Google music, who knows.  If not, I don't mind putting 5-6 GB of music on my phone.  Its mostly for work these days anyway, so needing it to be a great music device is pretty far down the list of priorities nowadays.
Yes, certainly all the rechagables I came across back then were NiCd. Actually what I said about NiMH (a steady 1.2v) also applies to NiCd, although an NiMH cell can hold a lot more charge than an equivalent sized NiCd.
If this didn't obviously void my upgrade for jump on demand, I totally would.  
Yup! SNote integration really works well with Evernote. I'm note sure with OneNote though, but I guess you could still export the file. 
I opted for 64GB and I'm glad I did. The system software takes up almost 12GB (Verizon). I didn't know that at the time, but I figured if I would take a lot of high res photos I would want the extra space.
I just disabled a ton of apps using package disabler.  I think I went too far, and now upon restart my screen is blacked out.  Still able to get into the phone settings, and still see time, bar at the top of the screen.  Any way to get back into package disabler and have another look to see what i accidentally disabled and enable it again?
I'm a regular crunchyroll user on my phone. I don't know what about the app or whatnot but I can watch for over 1hrs sot. Next time I do go from 100% to 1% I'll post a screen or something just to prove you wrong. 
I've disabled TW launcher and run Nova with no issues and no lost in features. 
5 - The stock email app is perfectly serviceable.  (I connect to an Exchange server.)2 - The stock messaging app is also perfectly serviceable.  I tried out the Verizon messaging app for a while but stopped using it bc it wouldn't send video.  The stock messaging app doesn't, however, send messages over wifi.  When I'm on a plane or somewhere with wifi but no data, I just switch back to the Verizon app.
Package Disabler, which is mentioned plenty of times and is known to really improve battery life, can also really disable the phone. Not in a bad way, but if you disable everything, you start to lose features. I once had it at disable all bloatware, but some things weren't working right, and the phone doesn't really tell you why. You just go to try something... and nope. He even says he disabled extreme power saving mode which would cause his phone to crash if he tried it. My question is why disable something that you don't use. I highly doubt having this enable uses any battery life. To me it is like he is just going for max battery life without a care on what his phone is actually able to do. Additionally, on battery usage, his screen is biggest, as to be expected, but second is Android system, then Android OS? This stands out as really odd to me since when I'm just browsing internet for a while, Chrome will be the second most battery draining source. I have a feeling he stared at his home screen for 12 hours (or forced it to stay or or something). Not running anything, or additionally having a dark background on an AMOLED screen will really get you long life. I have a feeling this is more of an experiment to see how long he could get screen on time, without real world usage. PDP really does work well, but be careful what you disable. Disabling Facebook and FB Messenger really helps pretty much any phone. I think that alone could get any phone an extra hour of SOT. Additionally brightness down will obviously help, maybe disabling a few other apps will help, running a few less widgets, etc. I'm happy with 6+hours of SOT, as long as I can still use my phone as a smart phone. 
50% or lower indoors and during night time , auto brightness under then sun.I switch my WiFi whenever I'm out of the house and i don't use location unless i need to call a restaurant.
I don't suppose the watch supports MST for use with card swipes does it? That would be awesome...
What I want is be able to view whole notes on my home screen. With any note taking app. Google Keep is the best option I've found so far but even that doesn't show a full view of the notes.
Wow, great photo.
I'd LOVE those links if it isn't any trouble. Also, just for the sake of trying to make this a two-way street, I'll try to explain the difference between a locked device and an unlocked one. When you get a device from the manufacturer it is unlocked, meaning basically  you can pop any compatible Sim card into it and use it with any carrier out of the box. When you get a phone through a carrier it's typically locked for use only with that specific network, therefore you generally can't(or at all that I'm aware of) buy a device from AT&ampT then swap the Sim for that of t-mobile and just hop straight onto that network. After you meet the requirements of your contract you can request your carrier to unlock it and they are now legally obligated to do so. Software exists to do this on your own if you decide you need to unlock for whatever reason without your carrier's assistance but I honestly don't know of any reason other than to use multiple carriers, for instance, if you travel out of the country often you may want to buy a Sim and service locally rather than paying your primary carrier for extra data or minutes while you're abroad.
And for battery life I have Pixel Filter, exactly what it sounds like. Can control how many pixels the phone uses. Turn it off when taking pictures or watching videos. For just normal functions I can get my battery, with medium to high usage to get about 18 hours on one charge. Next is Note Buddy you can change a whole bunch of features and its only for the note phone. You can change spen sounds when detachingmine makes a lightsaber on sound when I detach, and Saber turning off when I attach. 
I take it off the first day i got the phone.I used my fingernail to remove it and i noticed that a little scratch was made to the glass. But yesterday i cleaned my phone with a towel (the same that i use to clean my glasses) and today i noticed all those scratches.It doesn't affect the camera or the quality of the picture (with or without flash) but it annoys me that it's scratched :(Sorry for my english, not my first language 
No, it won't help with battery (not noticeably anyway).There are lots of tips to save battery life around, but in all honesty, it's a tiny battery on a big phone, it's just not going to perform miracles. Grab that wireless charger for your office or something. Mine gets me through a day, but not with much to spare, so having a charger at work is advisable.
Was your Note 4 still on 5.0, or updated to 5. 1.1? I noticed that full screen album art for soundcloud went away with the 5.1.1 update. 
Nope. All is says is Galaxy wants to access your facebook. I touch the notification, the phone flashes and Facebook opens like normal. 
I used chrome exlusively on my note 3 but on the note 5 they really improved the stock browser and I've only been using the stock one so far. My only complaint is that I keep hitting the 5tab limit!
Whenever you need to copy and paste text that you normally cant get to with your finger, use the S-Pen. Click the button on the pen and simply drag over the desired text to copy and thats it! Works to copy almost any text.
How?I disabled bloatware, location, have a dark theme, brightness on auto lowish, and I can barely squeeze out 4 to 4.5 H Sot. 
I clicked the promotion link from within the Samsung Pay appThe form to fill in my personal information was very jittery (the screen was vibrating up and down by about 5 pixels the whole time I was entering my information)Then the submit button didn't work, so I gave upWhatever, Samsung.
Oh I totally agree and get it...... pretty sad when one has to take such drastic measures to ensure that their phone operates properly.  I've been a cell phone user from day one when they first came out and I have never had this issue before yes I've had SD cards and all kinds of cards that you can add to your phone that have failed but they have a new damn phone and to experience this with its internal memory  is pitiful
Is the S Pen fully functional still?
Lol what a weird coincidence. I'm going to try it now. I hope it works with S Notes. 
Impressing girls with my off screen memo and getting their numbers in the process. I'm an occasional artist too, when I'm bored in a lecture or sumn. 
I was wondering if there was any point to adding gift cards to Samsung Pay. Is it just a place to manage your gift cards? I can't actually use the gift cards like I would a credit card through the app right?
Wow way to persevere.... I just got the Note 5 last week and I truly love it. I previously had a Galaxy S5.... but anyhow the note 5 is the first phone I've ever had that has made me realize how much Facebook destroys photos...I can look at a photo I took on the Note 5 and then upload it to Facebook and then the same pic looks like  somebody took half the pixels out..... it really wasn't obvious to me with the galaxy s5 but boy does the note 5 have a tremendous camera and remarkable screen.
Paid full price a week ago for Nova Prime. Still not disapointed. For $3 it was worth it. $1 is a steal.
My heart rate sensor did the same thing. Thinking if there's a way going around removing them
Aww thanks so much!! I actually just started an Instagram for these monstrosities at the suggestion of some friends, haha
Does your computer, console, or surface detect it as a usb device? The micro usb port could have gone bad. Have you dropped it? Has it fallen into the water? 
I use GSAM. I'm going to keep using the fast wireless charger, unless somebody here suggests I don't. The temperature while charging hovers in the high 80s, gets to the low 90s at most. We'll see.
I have both of these phones and switch between them on a regular basis. Both have a watch paired with them (Apple Watch for the iPhone and Moto 36v2 for the Note 5). Both phones are relatively new and the charging cycles are similar. Neither have facebook loaded and I watch for battery draining apps on both. Both phones are on wi-fi the whole time at home and at the office. The iPhone is on t-mobile with terrible signal at home and the Note 5 is on AT&ampT with awesome signal.On the iPhone I get 1.5 days between charges I need to charge, including 8 hours of almost zero drain stand by time. On the Note 5 I get about 2hours of battery before needing a charge and 8 hours of standby introduces a 15% to 20% battery drain.Screen on time is roughly equal but the iPhone sips battery when not in use where the Note 5 is shows fairly linear drain when not in use. I will regularly put the iPhone in my pocket at home for hours and see 2% or less battery drain.
You may not feel that way,  but let's be honest here...  That's how Android has been for years. It gets bloated up with carrier crap and manufacturer crap and the only way to deal with it is to debloat the phone.  I had similar battery drain on my 920i which didn't have all the verizon junk on it, but after running through package disabler pro (no root required) I get very respectable battery life and definitely better than I was getting on a 6s.
wow wtf are you serious? I have a skin covering the bottom touch key lights and you cant faintly see it glowing through when they turn on. I looked everywhere to try and figure out how to turn them off...Fucking Verizon I swear this will be my last phone with them...
Got it. Yeah I tried a mirror for the Underground apk, but no dice.I was able to download the amazon appstore just fine from an apk! Do you know if it has the exact same apps for free as the underground app?Edit: Underground won't install from the amazon app store... sad day :(
It was actually closer to an 80% charge
It was preinstalled on mine, all I could do was disable it. Now I just use chrome and it works great it even sends you notifications
Samsung pay=awesome 
A lot of apps drain battery too, might wanna consider deleting ones you dont use often if you can.
The thing is my nexus 5 focused a lot easier, and if this is the way the camera is then I'd really rather get something else like the V1or wait for the S7. 
The play store is far, far better than the Samsung store. Why would you not want to use it or the other Google services? If you're planning on doing that honestly an android phone isn't worth it in my opinion. 
Where is this picture taken? Looks really familiar
I have the regular wireless Samsung charging pad and it's crazy fast.  I can't imagine too many situations where I would need it to be faster.  Maybe I just got home from work and my battery is at 10%.  I have to go to a party in 3minutes.  No my phone won't be charged to full in 3minutes but it will get a ton of life pumped back into it.  And really, how often is this situation going to happen where you would need to charge it to full in a short period of time?I got the charger for $25 (50% off) from the AT&ampT store.  I guess a faster charging one would have been better and $7isn't that big of a deal to me but I definitely happy with what I have.
What? I'm asking about wallpaper, theme, etc for the home one
Scratching my gooch.Just kidding. I use it to replace the mounds of sticky notes that you would normally find plastered all over my desk. I like to take notes and the physical act of writing something down helps me remember what it is I wrote down. The built in Action Memo app is good enough for me. Plus I really like the customizable pen tips you can choose from. :)
Are you on Verizon? Im mostly asleep ATM but I remember an earlier post about Verizon disabling fast chargeEdit: NM I see you are on sprint
Layer paint
I have the white/gray Crashguard bumper on my white Note. The white sides are smooth hard plastic and the gray trim has a slightly rubberized texture. The hard plastic sides don't add any substantial grip and the rubberized trim doesn't prevent the phone from sliding on a slanted surface. The lip that protrudes onto the front does not interfere with any swipes. The bumper feels very durable and has an excellent snug fit on the phone. Although the open back makes it feel thinner than some cases, the bumper adds width and feels bulky in hand.
Themes don't drain the battery anymore than the stock look, do they?
I would set up just GMail on the GMail app and use the Samsung email app and set up your Hotmail account as an Exchange account so you get the Push option.
No it doesn't, it's the standard intuos grip pen. It's for intuos 3 and 4, I think the intuos 5 pen is a little different somehow, maybe that's why? I'm gonna try to find my old wacom bamboo pen to try as well.Sucks tho! I'd be willing to buy another stylus if it will work on my note since I love sketching on it. The built in stylus is so thin and gets uncomfortable after an hour or so of drawing.

Note 5 specs are just very high end, one of the phone that you will want to have for 2 years+ easily. definitely recommend it still.BUT .. make sure you get N920I, N920C, N920T(T-mobile), or something that will be supported by developers and you'll easily have good times for next few years..for CM/AOSP, dont expect much for it, though there is some group of people working on it and doing nice job but its not gonna be as stable as Snapdragon processors phones.for touchwiz, marshamallow is coming in December.! ---S7 will probably have a bit different design, better camera (N5 already have impressive one), Force touch (won't be much useful till at least 2 years), Exynos8 or Snapdragon 82(snapdragon is 100x better for AOSP/CM ROMs as samsung doesn't have proper Exynos documentation).If you're looking outside Samsung catergory, Nexus 6P and xperia Z5 (dual/premium) are pretty good.if you like Note 5, go for it, its one of the best you could get. if there is something you don't like about it and can wait, then look after the S7. Also to mention, if you dont use the S-Pen, S6 edge+ is better to have.

By ordinary wall plug do you mean the one it came with? Because that is the part you need in order to utilize fast charging. If you are, I would try using a new micro USB cable. If that fails, you may need a new wall adapter. If you can get your hands on someone else's to see if their's works try that.
Hmm that's strange. I tried to edit one of those over the summer and couldn't figure it out, then last week Google photos popped up And gave me an option to edit. Very strange ...
I've only seen 32. Best one was at Sam's for 96??. I'd be cool if they get a 64gb to $99.
Yep. Screen-on time is about the same range for me.http://imgur.com/c22eSTT
I just realized the correct translation would be Regulatory Is there an option for that in the About phone?
YES!!!!  Is the promotion period up for the 5bucks or the wireless charger or whatever they're doing?
First step - make sure everything on my Nova launcher works :P
Lol @ pops up. It's in the video as much as she is. She also uses it in Scream Queens iirc. 
You can get an external storage , like a mini USB to transfer all ur videos and photos to on the go. Battery life is decent with normal to heavy usage , and with the fast charging you should have no problem. 
Its technically not making the phone preform better, but I'd recommend going to Dev settings to change the animation speeds to something quicker. 
I believe you can edit them through Google photos
Now that you say that, I have been thinking of fully bringing back Google features and syncing. Of everything I disabled, that's the one that's made the biggest difference. It may be worth sacrificing some on screen time for it. The biggest problem, to be honest, is that I use this damn phone way too much. I'm pretty much obsessed with it. If four hours ost isn't enough for me, then I may have a problem. lol
I have unlimited data as well, but I'm concerned about battery life when I'm trying to save.
I use a artflow and sketchbook pro. Looking forward to picking up a galaxy note pro 12.2 just for drawing. 
I don't really have $60to pay retail price for a new phone. If I can't get it repaired or replaced at a brick and mortar store, I'll probably just have AT&ampT re-activate my old Note II and mail in my 5. 
That's dumb, shit on all the customers who purchased it week one by offering this bundle after the fact... 
KOTOR!!!! Such good memories of that game. If I can get a controller working, that will be a must buy!!
I completely agree I'm used to seeing more on what's using my battery anyways. I mean most of the time my things that use battery only adds up to like 45-65% and I'm like wtf is using my other percentage. 
I have that one and I don't really like it at all. It lifts around all the edges and around the home and back buttons. 
Maybe /r/android, but the bias against TouchWiz is strong there, with good reason. 
Not too sure. I'm on verizon so deal with the annoying cell standby problem draining my battery. You can try turning the phone off, then hold power home button and the volume up. When it loads up it will show a menu. Go to wipe partition cache. That will help a little
since you are so knowledgeable on this topic, I'm going to ask you one more question.If I do a factory reset on my phone, it will keep the latest firmware update, right? So if I get this update, then do a factory reset, I won't need to go back to BEst Buy and get the update again.
I second Textra, colors are customizable and it just feels clean. No lag when opening and closing text messages, but then again that might be the amazing processor on the phone :) 
I've had mine since September, and have accidentally dropped it one tile twice, and the vinyl floor in my room. I have very minor scrapes on the edges, but the screen, and device have help up excellently! I was actually very shocked after dropping it the third time, and having it look pristine!
This only works on the home screen. What I'm suggesting works everywhere (I have Nova Prime). 
how do you get haptic feedback from the capactive buttons if you have the power saving on?
I have an issue where when I unlock my device,  the chat won't update until I close the convo window then open it back again. Anyone else with this problem? 
last one, sorry to annoy you ish. is the ram management that bad? that's probably the only thing i don't like about it.
That make sense mostly. But you can still buy a nexus 6 through at&ampt and other carriers, but they're still nexus devices bloatware free. And samsung is the second most popular out there, right behind apple, so they should have more freedom than the other companies. But you can still buy bootloader unlocked android phones, as long as they aren't samsung. This would seem like it's samsung to blame, but then again other carriers don't lock the bootloader. So it's at&ampt and Verizon fault? But why only choose to lock some phone bootloaders and not others?

I just went 20h with 3h screen on time.  I run Bluetooth to my Gwatch,  WiFi,  and GPS constantly.  I was also disappointed in the battery after my first day.  I disabled all of the bullshit features I don't use,  and all of the bloatware.  I use du battery saver to kill background tasks every once and a while,  other than that I just keep the ram clean.Get a dark theme reddit app too.  
More --&gt SoundAlive --&gt Sound quality and effects? Mine only gives me to adapt sound with UHQ Upscaler, SoundAlive+, and Tube Amp Pro greyed out. 
Not yet, left a message with the service department. Figured I'd post this as well to hit two fronts.
Well, root can't be achieved on the AT&ampT or Verizon version.  It's locked down tighter than...  well, anything, really.  In addition, the versions that CAN be rooted and using an Exynos processor.  While the kernel is open sourced, the drivers are not, and nobody is writing drivers from scratch.  Don't expect much outside of modified touchwiz roms.
The Samsung Flip Wallet is my favorite so far. I use my phone to read a lot of ebooks and it's like holding a little paperback book. I've always preferred the OEM cases but didn't like the protective cover that well this time around. I didn't want the S-View because it doesn't seem like it has the same features the Note 4 version had and the S-View window was like a magnet for lint.
also make sure your finger entirely covers the button, if you use the tip of your finger and it doesn't completely cover it it almost always fails attempt.I know exactly how to hold my thumb on it now and it unlocks every time.

Gear VR for sure!
In gallery you have an option to do Photo Editor and then select draw which is awesome because I can start these wonderful creations straight from the gallery :p
I just need to root it to install things like lucky patcher or greenify and maximize my battery life
Once you plug it in. If you're using the oem fast charger it will say fast charger connected and when you scroll down it says fast charging. I also have a car charger that has fast charging but with that it will say charger connected then pop up and say fast charger connected. Scroll down meaning : notification screen 
I've got note 5 and iPhone 6 plus and I strongly believe, iPhone 6 plus has way better battery life than my note 5. 
http://imgur.com/FmzDWzrI also made the entire desktop interactive, clicking on the eye for example opens my reddit app. Apex launcher with Zooper widget 
but the fact is it was working when I first got the phone now it just wont charge :/
Did you use package disabler? If you disabled Samsung smart manager (iirc) or one of the Samsung service, the battery tab doesn't show up in settings. 
That's strange. I'm also with T-Mobile and I've never had that problem. If the home/power buttons don't turn the screen on... how? haha
Is that a brand of skins? Never heard of it. Could you show a picture of it?
Maybe if you USB tether to your comp instead of hotspot
I finally got around to it. I didn't want to delete my fingerprint, so I went to the application manager and deleted the data for the SP app. I was forced to re-enter my credit card info, but at least I was able to finally get out of the PIN creation/register loop. In haven't used it yet to purchase, but I will update when I do. Edit: IT WORKED!
I'm using one made by Spigen [found here](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B010MWD59I?psc=1&ampredirect=true&ampref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00). It's barley visible (only around the cut edges), works with my 2 cases, no halo, no bubbles, no problem with the S pen, and it feels great. Comes in a pack of 3 for a total of $9. [Here's all the reviews mentioning halo.](http://www.amazon.com/Protector-Spigen%C2%AE-Crystal-JAPANESE-Definition/product-reviews/B010MWD59I/ref=cm_cr_pr_viewopt_kywd?ie=UTF8&ampshowViewpoints=1&ampsortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending&amppageNumber=1&ampfilterByKeyword=halo) edit: [here it is on my phone](http://i.imgur.com/7b4qPAO.jpg). it's mostly visible around the button.
Very true about only the camera quality mattering down the road. Thanks for sharing. Very nice photo.
Hmm trying to figure out how to upload photos from what I can see my kernel changed and baseband 
Is it easy to replace battery on our own if we buy the battery from somewhere?Or would the only real option be to bring it into a repair shop / samsung store?
Download package disabler pro. It's 2 bucks, but very much worth it. A quick search will bring up the best things to disable for battery life.
Theres an app called [easyHome](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jamworks.easyhome&amphl=en) that has the phone treat your home button like a touch button, if it gives you peace of mind.
Never heard of it. Only power saving. 
on my edge yes i keep location on ( for tasker, wifi scanning all the time is disabled as the wifi bug was killing battery), dont use power saving as its against my principle for some reason .. I a would rather use it when needed as i see it degrades performance. i dont have facebook on and disabled the default app too. despite of all this i get this performance. Thats why I am so vexed up. I shouldnt need to do this., tinker heavily just go get through the day after paying friggin 850$ for this damn phone. 
What screen protector do you use?
You can use any widget with Nova. 
Before returning. You should ensure the sweet spot has been aligned. The note 5 is large phone with a relatively small sweetvspot. With car chargers you might need to move the bottom bracket down a bit to the centre of the phone is aligned with circular centre button.
Wasn't aware of the option of locking apps with fingerprint, that's pretty awesome!
In the photos app on your phone, go to settings and toggle remove geolocation from photos and videos you share via link. That'll take care of the map info. 
If you get them to switch your number to a pager in your contact the iPhone will always send as texts, not iMessage. Why, I have no clue.  But it worked up till iOS8, haven't tried it with 9.
As someone who owned the Motorola nexus 6 and the galaxy note 4, I love this phone. The battery is so good and the camera is amazing. Side note(no pun intended) I installed Package Disable pro to disable some apps which improved battery life and made the phone a little more snappier. The most battery I got was from 9AM to 1AM with 5 hrs SoT with about 7% battery left. Another thing that made me appreciate the phone more was the slimmed touchwiz, I hated it on the note 4. You can put themes on your phone as well. I put a material dark theme with nova launcher and it looks great.
This is my choice for one with a kickstand. 
Hey just got the update! It fixed the framework so you should be all set! 
There are two options. One is Samsung's Smart Lock which allows you to set home areas using GPS where your phone will remain unlocked when you are at that location.          The other option is to change your lock timer to keep your phone unlocked longer so that when you unlock your phone with your fingerprint, it will remained unlocked for a certain period of time and you only need to swipe to unlock.
We have the white and black in the U.S. with 32 and 64 gb. I really wanted the gold one since I've always used the white note and wanted a different color....
It depends.  If you get the white/clearish double sided tape, and make sure it is SUPER neat around the edge of the phone. Its not as noticeable.  
Here are some images.  Sorry the quality is poor...my Note 5 is the best camera I have but it can't take a picture of itself. http://imgur.com/SnET0MG for the fronthttp://imgur.com/a/6xczQ for the back and a closer up of the slightly off fit on the front skin
Doesn't require NFC
I bought mine for cheap off a seller in  an area known for copied goods. It works just fine, although it does have a halo, if by halo u mean a little air bubble all around the edges. I always assumed it's because I didn't apply it very well. What curve are u talking about btw? U mean the back?
Waaa is the note5 battery noticeably worse?
Had mine since launch. Been an amazing device.  I did get the original replaced due to random reboots 1-2 times per week.  It worked great just rebooted on it's own.  Definitely the best mobile device I ever owned and I've had plenty.  You will be very happy with your choice. Congrats!
Here's mine. I went for the stock nexus look. I also have App Dialer for quick access to apps. http://i.imgur.com/5A8Rgbb.jpg http://i.imgur.com/wfDCcGA.jpg
Size is the key here.  Big phone or little phone.  The Note won't be updated for 1months or so the s7 is only a few months away.  Personally I prefer larger screens.
Right yeah. That looks like it could be useful, thanks! Will look into why I'm not seeing 'pin to home screen'. 
From videos I've seen, just quickly pressing the home button will give you the lock screen, and pressing and holding for just over a second will fully unlock the device without lock screen. If this is the case, I'm even more excited to get a Note 5. I'd love to still be able to use my home button to just peek at my lock screen and just hold a little longer to bypass it with fingerprint.
Call Samsung a few times. A week after I got my Note 5 the click button on the end fell off while the phone was in my pocket and I couldn't find it. I called Samsung Canada about 3 times and finally got them to send me a replacement free of charge. All I wanted was a replacement button but they sent me a replacement pen.
Well, I figure if you're going to be watching movies, and having a library of them, just stream them over wifi. I don't see why you have to copy it locally, unless I'm missing something.
Just here to let you know that the touch wiz on the note 5 is way more tolerable than most people make it seem. This coming from an android purist who only switched to Samsung in August. On my international model I have no bloatware and I've disabled most of the stock apps I probably won't use, add a material design theme and action launcher and bam! Sweet ole baby. The screen on this thing makes it worth it more than anything else to me
Download Nova Launcher, Zooper Widget Pro, and Whicons (icon pack). PM me for help if you need it. 
In Samsung pay - if you're Verizon like me, look for the update roughly a day after the free charger promo ends.
Depending on the version you have try this:Settings --&gt Connections --&gt Mobile Networks --&gt Mobile Data --&gt Toggle off Enhanced 4G LTE ServicesI'm not sure why this worked for me but toggling it off boosted my WiFi from 3 Mbps to 152 Mbps when I had the same issues at University. My friends on their iPhones had no issues with WiFi and had that speed to begin with (152 Mbps) but I matched them after I toggled that setting off
To be honest, it doesn't really need to be on all the time. Most apps that need NFC, like android beam and Samsung Pay, will toggle it when necessary. 
Try a normal boot, and hold volume down after the android/gn5 boot logo. Don't hold power button.
I had an issue with mine sticking &amp not being able to turn the screen on and off with it. Luckily I was within the 14 day return policy with T-Mobile, so I went &amp had it replaced. No issues with the new one. 
got my email as well... happy day.. best part it was apparently shipped thursday, got the email today and it's scheduled to be delivered tomorrow.  Now if i can only get some lotto numbers i would be all set.
Let's just say I really regret choosing the John Cage [4'33](https://youtu.be/JTEFKFiXSx4) ringtone.
The vendor doesn't need to have nfc terminals, just swipe or pin and chip. As long as your bank or credit card company supports it you can use it literally anywhere
Oh God go launcher....Nova launcher is as close to stock but with a ton of customization. No discrption I can give can do it justice but it's the best $5 app I've bought.Some highlights:1. Unread badges via the tesla Unread plugin.1. Okay Google hot word detection.1. Custom page transitions 1. Desktop grid customization.1. Icon packs
Nothing you disable with package disabler pro would affect your apps from working on mobile data
Np! Really like that it isn't bulky and protection seems great!
I have 11.45GB free. The largest single file I have is the ROM I'm running (Rapture). I sync my photos to Google Photos and stream music through Spotify. I managed the same level of storage just fine on the Note 4.
Make sure your NFC is actually turned on... I made the same mistake because I keep my NFC off because I never use it. Tried to pay with NFC and couldn't make it work and gave up and used MST instead. Realized the next day it was turned off...felt like a big idiot. 
I got a bunch of Nokia DT-90and DT-901 chargers off eBay/Amazon new and used for under $15/each and spread them around them house.  They work like a charm and charges to full/keeps phone at full.  None have failed me and I just bought/received my last one from Amazon (used for ~$7), which makes it a total of 4 Nokia wireless chargers.
If you still have your Galaxy Gifts app, try installing through that. Failing that, install OneDrive from Galaxy Apps (rather than the Play Store) and hopefully the offer will appear.
My Spen I fell out once when I first dropped the phone. Did you have spen alerts on? 
what carrier are you on? I'm on Cricket and I think the fact that I'm on Cricket is the reason I'm having this problem. I talked to Samsung support and they said that there IS an update (but the fuckers can't provide it to customers directly, it has to go through the useless carriers). Cricket said ATT has no sent them any update. I've just grabbed an ATT sim, but I have to wait until tomorrow afternoon to see if it works without activating the sim card (which will cost me at least $4I think ... basically pre-pay for a month of service).Now, I had this same problem with Samsung Pay, but I went into BestBuy and the Samsung people knew exactly what to do and they manually updated my phone (why can't I do this myself?! BAH!!) ... but today I went to Best Buy today and nobody there even knew the difference between an Android OS update and a Samsung rom update. They looked at 5.1.1 and said you are up to date... ugh! Maybe this weekend I'll head over to a different Best Buy (longer drive).
im honestly not sure what you are talking about but if you use the spen you can copy anything. 
First off I need to see a picture of it... For science 
I've got an S4 and I'm going to be getting a Note 5 in about a month. I've got a 16 GB version and have far more apps than space for them, and I'm definitely going to invest in more internal storage on the Note 5. For me the added on sd card has never worked properly and it's something I've never used very much. I also, in the 2.5+ years of owning my S4, never got around to transferring my music files. My old iPhone 4 has been my trusty MP3 player, and if I want music on my S4 I've used Pandora to stream. The battery may be a bit of an issue for me, because I've got 3 backs up and I use them when I travel or am out for the day. However, I have friends with iPhones and other non-removable batteries who carry around these little power banks, so that seems to be a good solution. 
Check your S-Pen settings to make sure it's all enabled. If everything is good there, then they did not repair the sensor itself. They just removed the pen.
Ugh, my pen just did the same thing, except now only the top half of it will come out of the goddamn phone at all. There's so much about this phone I really like, but so much that makes me want to throw it against the wall at the same time.
That's the update from last week.
Snapchat is a bitch, I hate them for degrading the quality of my camera ???
More like sh*t.. just like the phone..If you are running touchwiz, which hopefully you are not
If you have your iPhone backed up through icloud, Samsung makes an app called Smart Switch which will take care of a lot of the transition woes for you.
Make sure you have installed the latest firmware. Optimisation feature came with a pretty recent update.
You're referring to the wake lock button right? If so, mine is the same way. Its a little looser than the day i bought it and isn't as clicky as my volume buttons.
Well there was a post in r/android of a guy booting CM on the SGS6, and we share the same processor so maybe, just maybe pigs will fly sooner than we think.
I forgot about the fact I applied for the offer.. It was October 31.. Just got it yesterday. Now if only Samsung pay actually supported my main card..
Note 5, its way better than the g4, but if you want an LG phone don't get the g4, get the v10
So you just get Samsung pay and they give you a charger?
It makes it easier using the pen to select apps, but I'm pretty good with using my thumb for it
Nope, the S Pen button isn't customisable in any way. Sorry. 
I love spigen cases. I've had one on every galaxy I've owned, and I've never had to buy another case. I'm also fairly clumsy and none of my phone screens have cracked, even with frequent drops. [This](http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B010MWHWLA/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?qid=1448816683&ampsr=8-1&amppi=SY200_QL40&ampkeywords=galaxy+note+5+spigen&ampdpPl=1&ampdpID=51tC6uJ-pdL&ampref=plSrch) is the case I have on my note 5. I can't speak for that specific case, but spigen is an excellent brand. 
Same here, but I just did a software update yesterday. Opened up Samsung Pay and wasn't prompted to update. Perhaps my so so work WiFi plays a part. 
I love having a competent, excellent camera in my pocket! Took my son out to the park the other day and was able to get some great shots with the Note. I always say that years from now, it won't matter one bit what kinda phone I had in 2015 - except when it comes to the pictures and videos that phone captured. Those will last presumably a lifetime and beyond. That's why having a great camera phone is important to me. Just wanted to share a moment with you fellow Noters. Keep that camera clicking and enjoy life!
Google drive
yeah the most recent update has been killing my battery
What kind of performance drop do you notice with that on? 
I really prefer cash. If the economy takes another hard crash and there is a bank run, online money will be worthless. I also enjoy the privacy of cash. 
There's been reported a lot of issues with noble kernel. That being said I'm by far no expert but maybe you can try flashing a different kernel. I'm currently using arter kernel, it's been pretty good so far.  Then try reflashing stock rom.
Then again you should go with the edge plus and not the note 5. The pen is the one and only reason to choose the note 5. 
Holy freakin crap, ive been watching your videos for a while now! Thanks so much!
[This](http://www.amazon.com/Protector-JETech%C2%AE-Premium-Tempered-Samsung/dp/B0132XCT0U) is an amazing screen protector. I've gotten spoiled and used to having a tempered glass screen protector since my iPhone 6+. This is the real deal, feels just as good as the actual screen and no ugly plastic smudges that you'd get from a non glass one. I highly recommend you get this ASAP and prevent your screen from getting little surface scratches. 
apples to eggs comparison - I've never even seen Apple Maps so I can't comment on the nature or the quality of the 3d models.Google not only has high detail 3d models, they also render 3d topography accurate to about ONE METER (so parked cars are rendered as deformed little blobs). I suspect if Apple runs smoother that they aren't doing quite the same things as Google. Google certainly has the capacity to push the data just as well as Apple.And Google Earth is running fine on my Note 5 - it stutters as it loads new information so lots of dropped frames while it's doing that. I suppose some optimization could smooth it out. I think it's just trying to do too many things at once.
I'm not one for platform wars or anything, just going from my observations )After comparing it on my phone and watching the below video they seem comparable in terms of rendering quality.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urSJLZTGiYk
Hey definitely DO NOT recommend slick wraps at all.  I've purchase two different skins on both occasions the quality is very cheap and although it's cool that's it's dry stick it stretches too easily and does not stick well.  Also customer service literally takes a whole day to reply back to you. 
This is what I've done, but it still feels strange not having a way to get to the home screen using the pen.

Wrong. Use a razor. It's an easy way to clean crud off of glass. That's what the guy who made this phone said he did.
I use the spen solely for smart select screen caps. It is awesome now that you can actually save them to device. Use that feature almost daily.
What app/widget are you using for the date and time
I'm new to android, so excuse the question but what is Marshmallow and why is it so special?
What's your total time on battery when you posted this? If you have 6hrs SOT on a phone that's been on for only 7hrs, that's completely different than 6hrs sot on 14 hours up. You need the total hours up to put in context. 
No, the nexus 5 does not have laser focusing, and the note 5 is faster in daylight, but I need a reliable camera for dim lighting too, and clearly my note 5 is not reliable whatsoever. 
How is the battery life? I'm planing on buying one tomorrow. I've looked through this sub and have seen some posts about the cell standby battery drain issue. Has this been fixed?
Just went to best buy and they had fast chargers. Now if only I would get my 5dollar credit..
The Note 5 I had shipped with 5.1, the 5.1.1 update was just this Novemeber if I'm not mistaken. This is when my Bluetooth went to shit..
Yeah I was having this issue as well. And my phone kept getting hot, so I rooted and installed a custom rom. My battery life has been insane ever since. 
I've never put any of my s pens in backwards on any of my Note phones over the years. I don't even understand how a person might mistakenly do it. 
At first I thought battery life was not going to be as good as it was on the Note 4 but I'm very pleased. Battery saver turned on at about 20%, sat idle since.
And there's no way to have a third party widget on the lock screen right? I disabled the weather on the lock screen so I wouldn't have to worry about seeing the wrong temp outside when my phone is locked. 
Yup. Sober since September of 2014, eyes are still a little yellow but the Dr.s have assured me multiple times that it just takes a long time. Ultrasound was clear and blood is clear, so here's hoping it doesn't sneak up on me 1years later!
What's even better is installing Gravity Screen. Your phone will turn on as soon as you take it out of your pocket or pick it up from a table. No button press needed! LinkMe: Gravity Screen
I'm not sure to be honest. I fixed it though. I just deleted the widget and  recreated it.
Samsung Pay's never getting to Canada... Still not a word on it.
What carrier are you on?  My battery life sucks.  I am on Verizon.
I had concerns about battery life too but I've been getting a solid 6 hours too. I think it's because I keep the brightness so low,  about 10-15 % I really don't need more than that.  This screen get super bright 
Disable, and I'm aware you can do it in the phone settings, but this tool let's you do it in one batch rather than individually.  Interesting, was it an article you read once or something.?Edit: did some searching and read several posts about it clearing apps. one of which was from the developer of Greenify.  Thanks for the heads up. 
You're not getting a good connection to the phone from the port/cable OR you're using an underpowered charging base. I'd change cables/bases around until I figured out if it was one or the other and eliminate the other from my rotation. 
Its a good case but expensive for what you get like ready mentioned. It has a similar texture to magpul cases without the design. If you don't like the look of cheaper cases like the unicorn beetle I'd say go for it. It's easy to remove and put back on too if you plan on doing that. 
If you post sot explain what you did. I can easily get 11 hrs of sot just with 40% brightness watching crunchyroll all day but when I just browse the Internet and use youtube with navigations I only get 4-5hr sot with half brightness. 
http://imgur.com/omwFSEV.jpgpeople usually say my setup is too cluttered and busy. so don't say it please? :)I like my setup, I've had basically the same setup for 2+ years now. It's got EVERYTHING on ONE page. I have no lock screen, I press the power button and that's what I see. All that glorious information. Keep is for 'to do' items and calendar is for date/time specific tasks (pretty empty now because I'm on vacation!).The weather widgets are 1Weather, Aix, and Beautiful widgetsI've got gestures associated with each icon, so swiping up on the reddit icon opens facebook for example.
Open multitasking.On an app that *can* support bubble mode, hold the part where the name of the app is. It'll pop up in a small window. Click the circle that's at the top of the window. Tap the shrinking icon.
yes 100%. Idk why the people who first replied seemed so against rooting. like you,  I came from apple because I want full control over my phone. both those roms are great, and during the setup process, they allow you to choose what bloatware (if any) you want installed. I'm getting over 7 hours of screen on time and my phone works flawlessly.
And lose Samsung Pay.

The only app i know to impact battery a lot is Snapchat so i don't use it much when I'm out
My battery has always sucked on the vzw variant.  No a factory reset will not get rid of the update.
No and NoThe top is kind of grippy, much like the bottom. It won't move on the charger. 
I am so glad that I am not crazy, I got a note 5 at launch and it was rock solid, and then I started using one again a couple weeks ago, and the bluetooth seems to be horrible since then. I cant even keep my phone in my pocket in my car, and when I take a shower I have a bluetooth speaker I had to move from the show to the top of the shower door so there isnt anything inbetween 
I got mine in about 2 weeks after submission. We have to use it before 12/31.I do not know what to do with $10on samsung.com. Not sure what I can buy for $100. (I do not want the VR)
You should. It'll change the way you use your phone. Launchers are basically your phone's interface. It's the graphical layout. Look into nova and action Launchers.  Literally download from playstore and just click on it.
I got 3 emails saying my IMEI was invalid :(. But it's correct.
Wireless charging pad? 
Could be the angle you were writing at, or if you have a screen protector that might be making your use more force. Also the screen protector could be slightly grippier than the bare screen you used at the store. I don't think the stock app has a feature that makes your writing look better. Although people have been saying my writing looks a lot better when I print things off my phone, so maybe I have this feature enabled without knowing. Either way get back to us when you find out. 
Have you ever found yourself wishing you wanted more storage on your iphone?  Or will you be willing to charge an additional battery for that rare occasion you're away from an outlet for over a day?Yeah I wish I had the option of expandable storage and spare battery, but on my note 3 I never once took advantage of those options. It was a huge driving factor for me at the time of purchase, but never once did I use it.
No option to directly print s-notes. Instead I have to email it to myself as a pdf and print using a pdf viewer....  quite annoyingAlso, the notes come with a very faint background color that's not exactly white. Wastes toner. And the notes don't print full page... But it's still better than papyrus with the pen. Edit: after doing more searching I found an s-notes viewer app that allows for printing, and even full page, but it pixelates everything for some strange reasonEdit2: wow, found out you can print directly from s-notes. You have to Hite Share then choose S-note format and there's a hidden print button there. And it's full screen!!! :D. I'm happy now. No problems anymore with the phone
I have been using this and have been very happy.

yeah im mainly worried about the storage since ive heard Note 5 has awesome battery life but on a phone this big I wanted to put some TV shows and stuff on to it so I can watch them on my way to Uni
I wouldn't say battery life is awesome. But mine lasts a full day after pretty heavy use of s-notes and spotify. Definitely need to charge it everyday. Not sure what to do in your case though. Will you be using the stylus? If not maybe look at a different phone. You really shouldn't get the note if you won't use the pen. I'd stay far away from Samsung if it weren't for the pen. 
Pretty sure the exynos chips are based off of qualcomm chips with in house modifications from Samsung. So it should still work. Even if it is a completely different processor, there's only one way to increase the speed of charging. If the phone supports faster charging then it should charge faster using any charger that can supply the power at that rate. 
Did you disable sync? Remove or freeze system apks?
The Pen seems really cool and something that I would enjoy using, but what kinds of things do you find that you use it for the most?
Are you on wifi when you experience delayed notifications? If so, do you have IPv6 enabled on the network where you experience the delay? (test [here](http://test-ipv6.com/) if you're unsure about IPv6)
I actually use it for note taking while I read.  Lets me quickly use different colors in pathway drawings when I need to.  Very handy, especially since I can print right off the phone.  But make sure you'll use the pen, the edge+ is a much nicer looking phone without the pen.
Maybe it's just me then.  I even prefer the Note 3's back over the Note 5, and that was a flimsy piece of plastic.  
The 5 is an amazing phone. I've had iphones and nexus 4 and 5 recently. The Note 5 covers all the bases for me, I especially love:- camera that can be turned super fast and has full manual controls (although the stock Samsung camera app could be better from a pro photo point of view )- wireless charging (I can't use a phone that doesn't have this now)- size/weight is just right- stylus is actually quite useful- screen looks great- speed and battery are great, I can understand the fixed battery is a problem if you're away from a charger for a long time, but with fast charging and wireless it's a non issue for meI did weeks of research before taking the plunge, absolutely no regrets so far.Edit: I'll add more thing I love about it, the fingerprint scanner, it works so well I forgot about it ha!
I think you ***might*** have a broken handset - the N920I supports all the bands (frequencies) that the UK networks use for 4G - I'd see if a friend has a 4G sim you can borrow or something, so you know if you have to return it to whoever.
The build quality and materials. The display, camera, fingerprint reader. I hate the software so much though...
On a note 5?  With the included quick charger?  Mine usually says an hour and five minutes until done and i plug it in under 10% most of the time.  4 hours is nuts, I can get a full wireless charge in that amount of time ....
XME ??Malaysia SM-N9208MYM ??MYM SM-N9208GLB ??Philippines (Globe) SM-N9208BRI ??Taiwan SM-N9208.Should be fine to flash either stock ROM without tripping Knox.
Very interesting. I had the nexus 4 for a year, started using the nexus 5 for the past 6 months, and now I'm trying to determine if I want the note 4 or 5. Currently in the first week of research, no other devices are striking my fancy.I started out wanting a tablet for the holidays this year. Then, got to thinking about it and came to the conclusion that I wouldn't use a tablet that often unless it was a surface pro that could run win 1to be a companion tool for my xbox 1. But those things are expensive and I already have 2 laptops and a desktop pc. So that's how I ended up looking into the note series and just happened to be around the same time the gn5 was coming out. Still going back and forth between the 4 and 5, leaning more towards the 4 at this point because of price primarily.
Loved my Note 4 and I love my Note5. The screen is excellent,  battery life quite good, and the camera rocks.
In some countries/locations it is illegal to disable the shutter sound, to prevent upskirters or bathroom pervs. Therefore many phones don't offer disabling that sound.
Any game really, i feel as if you just have to try and use it to see. The only think off the top of my head that I can say don't bother is anything that requires multi touch or fast tapping.One of the best games out right now and has been exceptionally good with a stylus is the new Star Wars Heroes. But it's a great game no matter what, playing as we speak.
Yep! I was sticking to free so I never found it in Google. But accidentally stumbling on Galaxy Gifts and finding it was the best thing ever. 
I have my location turned on and I go into a lot of shops. If you go into target, auto zone,  etc, I get a survey the next day. Also I feel like being 25 helps
The cord in the box is really low quality. Just get a after market cable  like a PS4 controller charging cable and you are good to go : )
World's of Lemmings,  very old school but does play better with stylus. 
I like colors. http://imgur.com/i2LIFMZ
Having owned both a note 4 and 5, the 5 is all about software improvements. It really does outshine the 4 when it comes to performance. The 4 is still a more than capable phone, and with the removable battery and SD card slot, it still appeals to many. But the 5 head a better camera, better performance, better battery life, and more software features. And it will have a better update cycle until the 6 comes out. It also has Samsung pay. My vote is for the 5
Wow that is some great battery life!
Keep monitoring it.  I did a factory reset and it fixed it -- for about 2hours.  Then the notifications came back with a vengeance and no other resets would fix it.  When I sent it back, the slip that was returned with it indicated they had changed the charging port, I believe.  I'll see if I can dig up the piece of paper.
Download the sounds using Zedge and then just apply them. 
I think it's intentional to make the notifications and clock more easily readable. But Idk for sure. 
Which game? 
So I have no idea about WiFi and Bluetooth but I had a lot of issues with Bluetooth on my  Edge+ and despite my troubleshooting the only thing I could do was exchange for a new one. Thankfully I got my phone from Costco so I could get a new one rather than some refurbished nonsense. 
I work in a phone store, Smartswitch. Just grab a USB otg cable
Awesome! I'm having the same problem. I switched from chase for the same reason as you. And one of the main reasons I bought the note 5 is for Samsung pay. So when the new card came in it let you use text or email?
Are you using Package Disabler Pro? That app disables one of the apk's for the battery settings. I forgot which one but that happened to me when I used that app.
Make sure WiFi scanning is off, GPS is off, and Location Services are off. 
For example, last time I tried, the stock clock/weather widget wasn't available.
I've dropped mine on tile a time or two, there are a few small but noticeable dents on the metal sides where it hit, but overall its flawless. 
This would be the case for my 2 year old galaxy s2. There was an option in recovery mode(?) to reset battery logs. I used the same battery for 2 years and resetting something/ doing calibration ever 3 months.For my s4 however, the same thing happened (battery level drops to zero from approx 60%) but this time the problem is that the battery ballooned and slightly detached the lower right corner of the display from the body.Btw, send it back when it does this constantly at specific battery levels. My s4 turned off when it reached 20% and would start at 4 percent when turned on again. It would recover, up to 16% while not charging then die again. After 2 weeks of putting up with this inconvenience the display popped up because the battery ballooned gaining half its original size.Its a long time ago when I've tinkered with phones and the hard part is that we can't actually pry this one easily. 
Ok so switching to a new cable and charger I achieved a full charge. Gonna pick up a new fast charge set up tomorrow will report back if that brings back my fast charge. 
Im a tech that works on these phones all the time. I have lots of stamps and lots of pens. Pm adress and I can send you a spen that was taken out of a brand new note 5. No charge!
&gt Thanks! Weird that Smart Lock is not approved, but I'll take anything that's faster than the PIN.
As mentioned below, The V1could be a good option. I have the Note 5 and have since launch. Its a great phone. The design is great, but to avoid shattering all the glass you need a case which takes away from it. The Spen is great but i honestly dont use it aside from some occasional notes and cut and paste images.I am going to utilize Jump on demand tomorrow and get the V1which for non business or social media bloggers seems like it may be a better fit. At least I hope so. The free 200GB Sd car, Battery and battery charger are a great bonus. 
They bought a company called Loop Pay that enables Samsung Phones to use Magnetic Swipe Technology, which is how Samsung Pay works on those Swipe credit card readers.
I can't find it either. Did a search and found the following...the Verizon Samsung Pay Enabler will be released to the Google Play Store on Wednesday the 21st in the afternoon as it takes some time to populate to all the Google Play servers. This enabler will allow full download and functionality of Samsung Pay to Verizon devices...
Poweramp is totally worth the price. 
Not sure why the hell anyone down voted you, so have an up vote on me! I like WiFi calling. Never have any issues with calls anymore. Also, I love the speaker volume on the handset with the Note 5. Especially with Extra Volume toggled. So much better than the iPhone 6 Plus I had. 
Front glass wouldnt work because all you would see is adhesive holding the front on. But i will try and post progress pics
Haha no probem! Ram management so far has barely affected me. I constantly have upwards of 1apps open at once (I usually close all when I get past that out of habit from owning iPhones in the past) and I don't usually go back to apps so the whole going through open apps just refreshes them thing doesn't really affect me. One nifty trick, though, is that besides two app multitasking mode, you can drag some apps to a small portion of the screen, down to a 4th, allowing you to multitask 4 apps at once! I don't know why you might want to but its a really nifty feature if you're perhaps taking notes, sending a text, and watching a video.
How good of an upgrade is it to use package disabler pro and disabling some bloat ware? Is it worth paying for it? 
Thanks for the tip, just updated. Battery usage optimization and security improvements always nice. &gt Gear VRNew one I'm assuming/hoping? Just sold my note 4 gear :-s
&gt You realize that under the USB tether portion it says you will be disconnected from a WiFi AP when you turn on tethering.It works fine.http://i.imgur.com/p8Y6R4o.pnghttp://i.imgur.com/OoO7WCQ.png
I am sure the right way is with Samsung logo and button facing you and pointy part first. 
I just got my note 5 and did a lot of research looking for a quality case and decided to go with the Verus [High Pro Shield][Steel Silver] its on amazon $20. It really is a nice case and is very minimalistic versus some of the others. It Fits like a glove and I have had no issues accessing any of the ports and I am super happy with the look of it.  
First question, do you really need a screen protector? The vast majority of people don't need one. Unless you live in a coastal area with a lot of sand or are particularly hard on your device, you probably don't need one. 
I remember middle school.  I've been having the same problem. I cleared all local data from google play services after the most recent update. but it still seems to be draining battery. It may be the usual issue of google location services causing the drain.
Typing this on my note 5, my 6p comes in tomorrow. This has been one of the most frustrating devices I've ever owned. The hardware on the note is awesome but the software is awful. I get keyboard lags, terrible battery drain, the phone won't deep sleep, and multitasking is a joke with touchwiz. My nexus 6 is a more enjoyable ux and its a year old. I vote 6p unless you really need the pen. 
Just checked for update and had it 
Thanks!  I got the Samsung charger from AT&ampT when I bought my phone.  It was only $25.  The phone lays flat on it.  I had to kind of finagle it once to make a connection but thankfully it gives me a little beep and gives an on screen notification when it connects.  I might get a second one for my bedside to serve as my alarm clock.  I use it as my alarm now but I rely on an actual clock to see what time it is when I wake up before my alarm (damn dogs).  
Both finger and stylus. Also same issue if the phone is vertical or horizontal. 
AT&ampT uses multiple bands for LTE, and the bands that are in use vary by area. So you may simply be in an area that does not have the bands that AT&ampT uses. Some people will get LTE in some areas, others won't in other areas.
You have to hold the shutter button or volume for burst mode. Not sure if you can adjust interval. 
I just flashed Hyperdrive and really like it. Aside from being able to customize things like icons and colors, though, it isn't too different from darthstalker
It's preinstalled Samsung software. Shows up as an app rather than a Settings item.
About 3-4 hours of SOT. I don't do anything special and with quick charge 2.it's really not a big deal to plug in for a little while before I leave the office.
To the people who received the $10promo code, can you post the email address they used  to send you the code or the subject line that way I can search my inbox? I'm not gonna have internet access for a week and going thru 100emails is gonna suck.
From the reviews i watched on it, it was hard to push the buttons and not worth the price tag
S voice has an option to wake up phone from lock screen. You have to be on the home screen to use Google now. But everything else is much better in Google now
Any progress for those who have tripped Knox? I imagine no, but might as well ask. 
Also, I use Nova as well.  Doesn't ever come up as a battery hog. 
There is no measurable advantage over plastic. 
Just redeemed for a flip cover on ATT version Note 5. Don't even need to pay for shipping!
I in no way meant to imply that I knew all the answers, I was simply presenting my thoughts. But I actually am curious as to the costs. Because you could probably go the el-cheapo route and get clear plastic panes instead of glass. That you could almost 3D print, though it would be not as clearly transparent. 
Not a fan of how left has name badges, but right doesn't. Any reason for that? I really like that widget though, what is that?
Thanks for the explanation that was well written out. I'm enjoying my note and Android experience so far 
That's the same screen on time I get with my phone. I'm too am on Rogers. I also disabled the bloatware but I leave location and data on the whole day.Maybe when you aren't actively using your phone and you're just using it for streaming music then you can switch to the power saving mode.
Fog or smog? Awesome picture! 
Download Blackmart.apk, you won't find it on the play store so try Google. Afterwards run the app and search for the application you are looking for. You should be able to run it.
I forgot to ask, are you using package disabler or are you manually attempting to disable programs? That's the difference. If you are manually disabling, thats why your Android System battery usage is so high. Package disabler allows you to disable background processes as well
I use fingerprint and nah it doesn't show adjustment to volume on screen while locked 
I agree with that, honestly I never used the SD card that much, just to put some songs in there.
It is in developer options.
If only my friends had telegram 
This is one of the major reasons why Android is better than Apple. Don't like the stock keyboard, there are better ones on the market that can easily replace it....My personal favorite it Swiftkey as mentioned by /u/GetMeABaconSandwich
Happened to me. I changed the cable i was using, worked perfectly after that.  The cable that comes with the N5 isnt the greatest.
Hahah, enjoy!! What's the appeal of the Gear VR? I haven't really been keeping up with VR technology! 
I have got one of the original one that takes a pen from the note 3 inside, works fine on my note 5
What software version are you on?
Samsung offers ArtRage free for certain devices in the Samsung Galaxy range, as part of a partnership with us, but it's normally a paid app. You can get it for free on the following phones/tablets:* Galaxy Tab S2* Galaxy Tab A 9.7??with S-Pen* Galaxy Tab A 9.7??* Galaxy Tab A 8??* Galaxy Note 5* Galaxy Note 4* Galaxy Note EdgeIf you don't have one of those, you can buy it from the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ambientdesign.artrage.playstore) or from Galaxy Apps. 
I bought [this one by stalion](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0141GGNFO) off amazon after having another one from amazon come up a dud. I'm pretty happy with it. Minimal halo on this protector, only a slight halo on one side because I couldn't get it perfectly centered but not noticeable really. honestly, i think this phone is really tough to put a glass screen protector on it perfectly because of the edge curvature of the screen so it will only be as perfect as your alignment (which it comes with an alignment aid that i stupidly removed and didn't use).
Yeah sorry man. It would be cool to have some kind of tracking in the pen itself, but who knows if Samsung could build that in and keep it so slim. Either way. This seems to be the easiest pen to lose so far in the note line. And the easiest to break also....
Hey OP, Samsung Pay employee here. The lack of the option showing in Tap and pay settings is definitely causing the behavior. Samsung Pay should be showing there. We're believe the sideload of the Framework may be the cause. We would suggest the following:1 - Open Apps &gt Settings &gt Applications &gt Application manager &gt Samsung Pay Framework (Under DOWNLOADED tab)2 - Tap FORCE STOP, then CLEAR CACHE, then MANAGE STORAGE3 - Tap UNINSTALL UPDATES4 - Return to Play Store and install the app again. When viewing the Framework in the application manager, if your device has the option to UNINSTALL UPDATES for framework as well, please do so. It is normally grayed out. If it is still giving you the same result, PM me and I'll pass contact details over. 
So its just the screen's design, its unavoidable?  So i guess a theme with darker stuff would be better?  What actually causes screen burn?  Light colors or what?  I see people with solid white themes and no screen burn.  but my light blue one burned me.  
It's worth way more than that, in my opinion. I went ahead and disabled all of my carrier's and Samsung's bloatware, started to use Action Launcher instead of TouchWhiz, and modified the theme. This is what my phone currently looks like. Nice, clean, and organized. Of course, I'm OCD about these things, lol.[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/DyLChhK.png)[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/E0GAemb.png)
Are you keeping the lens in the center when rotating the device?
Gothic Bold. http://imgur.com/yGqLddw
Nope. Kik works fine if I'm not using many other apps and I'm regularly opening it to read messages but my phone randomly decides to stop it if I've used a few apps or haven't opened it in a few hours
I saw this just last night and didn't know if it would work for me just because the instructions were for a t-mobile device but I'm beginning to become convinced that the carrier has little to nothing to do with it. Though tbh unless there turns out to be something amazing that sets one apart from the others I'll probably go with Darth Stalker just because it sounds extra cool. :)
I still can't mine to charge my phone. I tried lowering it and trying different spots but still keep getting blue light. What exactly did you do?
I haven't seen this but I have a few questions. 1. Have you restarted the phone recently?2. Does this happen on Sprint's network or WiFi Calling?3. If on Sprint's network, is the phone connecting through a microcell?I'll also recommend that you factory reset your phone.  This might help stop the issue if it is a software glitch in your phone and you've have already restarted your phone.
I couldn't find a way to make it work when. Screen is off or from the lock screen, if you figure out how to do that let me know
I recommend phone scheduler. I have been using it for a very long time on every android I get I install this on. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.antonc.phone_scheduleAlso there is do not disturb mode build in to your phone
Regarding root, you cannot *currently* root the Note 5 without tripping KNOX. I doubt that will change anytime soon, but that's how it currently is.
That makes me so mad! I'm used to turning off my Bluetooth headphones without pausing and them my music just starts blaring
There is a black shadow that goes up and down with the picture but at a slightly smaller pace than the picture itself. I can't describe it but I can see it on the recording... I'll have to double check on my computer that it came through but I can see it on the recording from my phone.Usually only happens on black on darker black settings (webpages, apps, etc.)
I've currently set only my Google account in Gmail and the other 2 Hotmail ones in the Samsung email app. If this doesn't work, I'll try your method. Thanks! 
You can get rid of it if you remove all but 1 keyboard from your phone e.g. using Package Disabler Pro.
I love my crabby wallet. It's crazy thin &amp  small. Edit: I guess I should mention, instead of a wallet case. I always had wallet cases til I found the crabby wallet. 
I was thinking the same--I'm glad you agree.  I talked to Samsung support for half an hour, and beyond restarting and resetting, they just told me to send it in.  Which I'd do, but twelve hours later I still haven't gotten the shipping label they've said they emailed.I wonder if Sprint will let me activate my old phone for free.  I certainly hope so.
That's an awesome picture. Where was it taken?
YMMV with the store install. The guy at my store literally wiped off the phone screen and dropped the screen protector on with very minimal lining up. My front facing camera was half blocked and it was really crooked. I had to take it off and reapply it when I got home. 
Slowed down the shutter speed as already mentioned. Then did a little bit of editing in lightroom.
Pretty sure the back is gorilla glass too... 
Thanks and sorry for the vagueness, yes I did wipe system, davlik, and cache but when I went to load the rom it wasn't there. I used a usb otg to load the rom onto there and then pass it onto my note 5 but I guess somewhere along the lines it never transferred to my note 5 and I wiped everything -.- 
look at all the room for an SD card!  *cries*
I applied the mattblack theme,  and then disabled all the Samsung stuff in PDP,  and switched to Nova launcher.  Basically,  it themes the UI,  but you still get to customize your launcher how you like. 
I had this problem today! I thought what are the odds that uninstalling facebook messenger will fix my screen in the top left, but it did. crazy stuff indeed. I like facebbok messenger and hopefully they will fix it via an update.
Spigen Neo Hybrid Carbon is what I used on my Note5.  It was pretty awesome.
I actually liked the stock messaging app as well. The added functionality with the s pen is great. The only issue I had with it is there is no wag to turn off screen on when getting a message. 
$10to take away half your display and make you slower seems like a bad value prop. Plus, it's hideous. 
I believe with the note 5 the glass and digitizer are fused together so you're going to have to replace them together.  There's videos on YouTube showing how to do it though if you wanted more insight. 
The advanced calling feature and removing Facebook and Messenger did it for me. I get great battery life now, much better than my old HTC One M8, and have mostly stopped thinking about battery life at all. A lot of that has to do with fast charging, so when I get home and only have 15% left or something, I know a half-hour or so on the charger will give me another couple hours of life.
Darthstalker was ok.  They're all basically the same shit right now, there's not much that they can do as far as customization.
http://imgur.com/pF2SlVETried to be simple and clean with Nova Launcher
I use my phone for work, and the program they make us use has a GPS tracker that pings our location every few minutes.  So my battery life isn't all that great, although I can get through a whole day on a battery.  Now on the weekends when I kill the software, the battery life is amazing.  This is the best phone I have ever had.
I'm actually using Greenify to do it. You can assign Greenify's Hibernate + Lock Screen shortcut to Prime's Double Tap gesture.
God damn it, Telus, you better send me my update! My Gear VR is coming in through the mail soon!
Got a link to that wallpaper?
Nope, combination of Nova Launcher and some icon packs.
I'm guessing that case is too thick to let wireless charging and nfc work?
It all depends on what you want. I loved the edge + but the SPen ultimately sold me on the note 5 and I have no regrets. 
If you just want to take pictures with gloves, double tap home button to launch camera, then use volume key to take the picture. Otherwise, use the same pen 
That's correct and Samsung Pay will not work once Knox is tripped. 
I'm not saying it's impossible. I'm saying it shouldn't be the end-game for everyone. I'm simply adding weight to the other side of your point, I can't count the times I've needed a backup card or the cashier needed to type in my info because their MSR terminal was fucked up or hadn't been cleaned since Clinton was President. You can't read the card number on Samsung pay. If you go to a shop that for whatever reason can't use the tech, and you don't have a backup card, you're boned. Those things happen more than you'd think.
I'm also using one for the first time ever on my note.  Now that it's on,  I don't know why I never used one before.  My only complaint is that it's not as long as it should be,  so there is a decent gap in the top and bottom of the face between my case and the screen protector.  But like you say,  a small price to pay for the protection offered. 
Thanks, I've been trying to figure this out for 2 weeks now. I tried taking a picture of the qr code on the baggy but the camera wouldn't focus on it.
https://youtu.be/M14CWF5gnT8 This guy suggests a way to fix the high idle. Worked great for me so far. Close to 11h of use throughout the day as long as I stay off YouTube. LOLEdit: I also keep the brightness at 50%, then turn on the auto brightness, and use dark wallpaper, and basic mode for my display. I use it for a lot of photos, and the basic setting provides me the best color accuracy. 
Same here. It is so fast. I'm actually swiping now with the pen! 
No, I installed foxfi, then the key. And I tether my ps4, tablet and laptop at times. I did pay for the key too. 
This has been going around here a lot. Many have same issue as did I. The USB cable that came with phone is piece of shit.  Get another USB cable that is capable of doing fast charging. 
I'd use the touchwiz launcher if I could rename icons. I hate apps that get ... because of the name, like Reddit is fun golden platinum. I just want it to say Reddit. So I'm using Nova Prime.
Try the aukey quick charge 2.cable. I found it to charge faster than my old charging cable by a lot.. literally charges around 20-3minutes faster from 20%
the note 5 is, but this is instead of cardboard
I had a Chinese note 4 screen protector on. Saved my phones screen a few days ago while i was carrying a heavy aluminium box. The glass got a crack but the screen was safe!
If you use it a lot, you'll probably run out of battery by the end of the day. So I recommend bringing an external battery with you. There are power-saving modes though. If you need extra storage you can use a micro usb to micro sd card reader. I haven't filled up my storage yet so I don't have one.
I have the N920I. I haven't noticed any lag whatsoever, which actually surprised me, given my previous experience with Samsung handsets.
$60/year, or $5/month sounds steep?  That's half the price of Google Drive which charges $10/month for 1TB of storage.  This is $5/month for UNLIMITED storage.
I'm looking for the same thing but haven't found anything yet. You can see notes you've taken with the Keep app but can't write more on them.
Ah, you meant your battery would be at 50% with those standby numbers only? Not much magical about that then. Mine can do standby for a week, but that doesn't mean a lot to me. I suppose 5 hours SOT isn't dramatic, I just expected a lot more. My gf's 6s does 7 hours easy, and the 6s plus is apparently even better. 
Rumors are the Note 5 will get Marshmallow by the end of December (though carriers will dawdle as they normally do). That said, the S7 coming out soon means the S6 will no longer be the S flagship, but the Note 5 will remain the Note flagship until ~August, so I doubt it'll fall to the wayside for a while -- and even then, if you get a rootable model it should be worth it for quite a while longer.
Just checked. Widgets are the same. 
Nova Launcher it is, then!
I got two originally, since they were $1 each on Amazon:  an Ailun, and one by Stalion.  Both were packaged wonderfully, in fact the Stalion was the best packaging I've ever seen for a protector.  The Stalion fit great with little to no halo, but sadly I installed it over a piece of dust, and when I went to remove and reapply, I broke it.   I installed the Ailun, which has a pretty bad halo, but Stalion sent me a replacement that I might try installing tonight.
Oh man, I agree. On a heavy day of use for me I can still get to 10pm with one charge. Some power users just no life it all day and complain about their battery-life while the real issue is that they have nothing better to do with their time. 
I might be wrong but I think the conversation is just the issue. If there is an existing convo it will default to the iMessage medium for transfer
Did the same thing with a galaxy s6 a few weeks back but need to buff out some scratches http://imgur.com/NoRhaiK
Really? I just took a look at my settings on my N920W8, and I found the Abnormal Battery Usage section, but nothing about optimizing battery usage for apps.
Can I get the wallpaper and widget? I LOVE this!
That website lists that the N920i does not work with Three on 2G, that covers EDGE, GPRS etc? If so there will be some areas that I will not be able to connect...
Its akward to use it when writing with the pen. 
Your point about the fingerprint scanner on the back.  I used to have a LG G3, and for the first few days, I thought they were stupid to put it on the back since it took some learning.  Since I learned it, I would want it on any phone I have, it's just convenient.
It only ships to the US but I'm getting a friend to proxy it over to me in Canada. Will be upgrading from my Note 3 N9005.The N920i has all of the LTE bands for a ton of countries including Canada which is great. And the battery life will hopefully be a lot more solid than Lolipop on the note 3.
I ended up getting the regular 25 dollar screen protector,  and I like it just fine.  I'm a bit skeptical about the glass one.  Would it really protect the screen from cracking? Also it can still be scratched like the regular screen. The plus side is that you can replace it for free,  but it's  through the company,  and you have to mail them the original to get a new one back. I can barely tell I have a screen protector on. I can only tell when I use my fingernail.
And when/if we do get Wells Fargo added, and can activate sPay, we still wont get the freebies that the first users received.Thanks Samsung/Wells Fargo. I guess I'll just stick with Android Pay.
After testing your ISO and exposure settings in pitch darkness with my Note 5, I don't believe you. That and I can see a shadow under your coffee table.
Hey, it said that KIES3 wasn't compatible with my Note 5 and I had to get Smart Switch.  Now Smart Switch keeps trying to connect to my device but it doesn't.  Does it need to be in a specific mode?
Fixed it! It was a process in package disabler that was marked bloat called Samsung mirror link. I recommend everyone make sure they didn't disable it or you won't receive any text messages with a link in them. Also please mark it as not bloat 
I bought this phone exclusively for the pen. If not for that I would bought the nexus 6p hands down no question.
It seems that with the note5 its very very picky about placement. Didn't work at all for me at first but now I can get it every time. I basically have to make sure it's perfectly centered then moved slightly closer to the cable. My girlfriend's s6 can just be casually placed for whatever reason. 
i have both the samsung fast wireless and the choetech fast wireless chargers.  worked like champs with my defender case till recently.  now i have to deskin for the choetech charger and go nude for the samsung charger...
no, I'd turn off all your smart unlock stuff to keep the experience consistent no matter where you are. Kind of defeats the purpose of the fingerprint reader, having it on.
The light on mine turns green after charging to 100%, and stays that way until I think I receive a notification, at which point it turns to flashing blue and from there the battery will discharge.  My old Galaxy s4 charging pad doesn't have this same problem. To test it out turn off all notifications overnight, or go on airplane mode, then check in the am if you're still fully charged. The random frequent disconnects that happened right after launch were fixed with a software update, so I'm hoping this one is also addressed down the road as now I have 3 free puck chargers that all experience this issue, one free from Best buy at launch and 2 from Samsung for the Samsung pay promotion (2nd was in error) In the meantime I bought a 3 coil charging pad on Amazon that I should receive tomorrow
Haha yeah I really do like this phone and would cry to see it broken. I tried one TG already and the haloing was awful. It was pretty damn near perfectly set too. Took that off, tried to adjust, got a speck of dust under it but still worse halos...then tried to readjust one more time and the whole thing shattered. It was supposed to be a resettable one :(Right now I just have plastic on it for non-scratch and I may just take the $10/MO for insurance.
&gtWhile TouchWiz doesn??t allow for much flexibility and variety, there are many options worth checking outI guess my question is what is this in reference to, as in what flexibility is provided in a more aosp based skin..?
Yep me too. Glad I'm not the only one. I just use the back button at the bottom for now. Hopefully it will be patched soon
N920T is fully compatible with ATT Bands. All LTE bands will be received. You will NOT get VoLTE or Wifi calling on ATT. I have another N920T on ATT Straight talk unlocked which Band 17 was connected at multiple times.  Also, Band 17 is not the only LTE band ATT uses... they also have Band 4 which is the one you want to have for high speed... 17 only gives better reception for crowded areas and building penetration.
Tired of this lime green trend! Wish I could just change the colours without changing the icons!
I thought it was like the 15th of this month. But I was suppose to get a $5best buy credit to sign up for Samsung pay. It's been almost two weeks and nothing. I got a conformation number and everything. 
Cerberus. It will make your phone unstealable. I have it set up so the power button doesn't work on the lock screen, so it's impossible to turn off when locked. You can also remotely back up and wipe all your data, make the phone emit a really loud noise, and the tracking is really accurate. After that SwiftKey, package disabler pro, relay pro, and gonemad music player. 
Glad you're already familiar!! I was so happy when someone told me about it at work. I've typically rooted my Notes but with the N5, I don't really have a need to with the Disabler. Good stuff. 
I keep getting emails saying my vr is out if stock and it's on backorder. 
Auto brightnes on this device is bloody  aweful! You can find what I did in a comment down bellow. 
Up to you if you love tinkering with small details and having more customability then rooting is great. Also if you root earlier on you will regret it less because you will have to wipe your phone when you root and you lose user data. However being as you owned IPhone in the past you may not need customability. Androids that are not rooted offer so much more in terms of customability than apple right out of the box. Therefore it all depends on you but this is what you should consider.
YouTube adaway, and root cloak 
Someone needs to take a slow motion video of a Plasma ball.
Unfortunately, yes, you do. Lightning Launcher makes alphabetising really easy, though
Tech 21 is the best I've ever used. Had it on most of my notes, can take a two story drop (most of the time) and keeps it very thin still.
I can't speak for other carriers, but the Verizon model has so much bloatware. I just wanted it to be gone. 
I'm having issues with the screen turning on. Not rooted and not even using Package Disabler Pro. I have to press the home button at least 3 times sometimes before it comes on and I'm pressing it HARD because someone brought it up to me that I may not be pressing it hard enough. So, I've started pressing it harder and this issue is still happening.This is more on the wireless charger that I purchased but it stopped fast charging on the fast wireless charger that I purchased. It will still regular wirelessly charge just not fast.Also, it lags a lot for a phone with 4GB of RAM and the app refreshing is annoying.The battery is also bad on this. Don't get me wrong, I get 4+ hours of SOT but when it *does* work with me I get 5-6 hours of SOT. I don't game at all on the phone. When I am at work it drains like mad just sitting in my pocket. I do have location settings on max but even turning those off doesn't seem to help. Also have my Moto 36(not looking forward to factory resetting that when I get the 6P (read below) that's super annoying) connected sometimes when I am at work (don't wear it everyday but when I do I have it connected). Bluetooth is always on as well.I've tried minimum settings and I always use low brightness/auto brightness and still my battery dies faster than I believe it should. I believe Marshmallow should stop this madness but I'm not willing to wait (unless I do because I have to pay off my CCs first (below).I'm actually working on paying off my credit cards so that I can purchase the 6P and give this phone to my mom. I'm not letting the people over at /r/nexus6p scare me away!
Hi, is this feature (Google voice search with screen off) still working on your Note 5? I have the OK Google hotword box ticked in Nova Launcher, and I have trusted voice ticked in the Google app settings, but this still doesn't work for me at all.
I struggled with the metal back plate for some time. It blocks the wireless charging and the NFC (Android Pay). How do I know? When I removed the plate, both worked fine.  Put it back, and no luck. I finally determined that if I use a very small plate just under the camera (i.e. top 1/3), it will charge. I have not yet tried this with a pay site, but hoping for the best because I love the magnetic mount.I previously tried putting the plate down low on the phone. I found that with the plate low, the phone tends to start leaning one way or the other since it is top heavy.The disadvantage of the plate high on the phone is that it is relatively easy to knock the phone off the magnet when using the controls at the bottom. UPDATE: I notice that the back of the phone is getting quite warm using the wireless charger as others have reported (much the same as an induction cooktop works). Also, on my first attempt to use Android Pay, it worked. Remains to be seen if it works in other locations.
I got mine awhile back and then in the 15th I was able to use it. I ordered the gear vr. Just got an email saying they are back ordered now. He'll, it's free so I can't complain but I wonder how long it will really be. 
The only thing that sucks is my card doesn't work with Samsung pay. Also that I didn't switch from and iphone.Edit: wording, I just woke up.
It's a security update. More info can be found [here](http://security.samsungmobile.com/smrupdate.html).Edit: The security update contains 19 CVE items (Common Vulnerability and Exposure IDs). Details of issues fixed can be found [here](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2015-12-01.html).
Security updates will be coming out monthly-ish from Samsung/T-Mobile. 
I'm in the US but I use iCarez it's on amazon and supports the little curve the glass has. It's  $8 so it's cheap and has a warranty.
Can anyone who has owned the 6P comment on camera quality vs. the Note 5?
This is a known issue with Galaxy apps pushing the stupid gear VR app which enables power sharing which causes this issue. My app installed over WiFi last night and started doing this. Everyone over the website says they think this is physical damage. My phone is 2 months old. I checked the port and everything. Performed hard reset and cleared cache. Such utter be that Samsung installed this app and pushed it to my phone for something just don't even own and then it effs up my phone. Check the web. Others are having the same issue
The radios might be different. Also, sometimes products are revised after production begins to address issues or to make them more efficient to produce. Perhaps you got a newer revision from AT&ampT and that could also explain the differences you noticed.
Update 12/17 : So this evening, 2 more boxes came, with 2 more sets of gifts, so I have now received 3 of everything!
No, not Wifi itself. It is a setting in WiFi settings that allows the phone to keep searching for WiFi even when WiFi is off. You might want to turn that off, it was a huge sucker for me. Settings &gt WiFi &gt Options &gt Always Allow Scanning - Set this to off/never. 
After I saw this thread last night I checked on mine and sure enough, an update was available. 45MB downloaded and now i'm on 12-01 security level
What is the current firmware/build on your device? 
If you've ever tinted windows on a car, you'll know the same pain. I've used very minimal amounts of warm soapy water, like just a few drops on the screen when applying new protectors with great success.
http://imgur.com/XyuKDSrI know, I am a very unorganized man :(I used Action Launcher + Whicons to make the white 7x7 grid and I am happy with the results. Soon, I will be trying to make some custom widgets as this is too plain for me right now. 
I use an LG G Watch. It's not the best looking, or has the most features, but I got it cheap and it's a great entry into the smart watch field. I used it on my old Droid Turbo, and now with my N5. The G Watch supports NATO Bands out of the box, whereas the Moto 36(which I almost got) has to have special adapters.  Battery life is amazing on it too, and Google Voice recognition is top notch. 
This is just how Lithium in batteries work. They don't just completely stop working,  they just don't last as long.  Typically after 300ish cycles you'll lose 10-20% of the original capacity.  So after years of owning a phone,  you could easily be down to 60% of the original capacity of the battery.  Source: I manage a store that specializes in cell phone repair and batteries of all kinds. 
Google Drive, but for most bang for your buck (I have this as my second option) is Amazon Cloud Drive.  Unlimited storage for $60/year.
What bumper are you using?
Did you enable power saver mode?
This. I'm using a Spigen Slim armor, its a bit bulkier but I am very satisified with the quality of their cases. Never buying a shitty otter box again.
You got an easy way of removing the case? Got it today and its great, looks slick and looks to offer great protection (Not gonna try dropping though...).Seems difficult to remove, and I feel like I might accidentally scratch something lol. Forgot to wipe off the back of fingerprints and such before installing
AmEx notifications are spot on. Every time the PTC charges my toll account I get notifications from Samsung Pay. Haven't tried my Citi card yet. I love it. Wish BofA would support it.
Moderate to heavy user here. Average 4 to 5 hours SOT. Screen brightness at 50% (auto) which is surprisingly clear enough for daytime navigation. And I disabled some Samsung apps, but still got S-Health and most other bloats running. 
Instead of putting a new glass back, can it be replaced with a plastic back?
Samsung isn't copying Apple. Sony, HTC, Moto have all gotten rid of removable batteries. The Nexus devices haven't had removable batteries or memory cards for awhile now. It's the wave of the future. What innovation are you looking for? Award winning displays? They have that. The only smartphone with the ability to use Tap and Pay with terminals not having NFC? They have that, too. A true and accurate heart rate monitor? Yep, on board. So again I ask, what are innovation are you looking for? The ability to make toast? It doesn't fit your needs anymore and that's why we have the beauty of choice. That said, LG is slowly becoming your only option. Pray they don't follow the trend, too. 
is it Spotify? have you tried any other streaming? I stream gpm and use maps frequently and this never happens to mealternatively, are you in power saving mode? 
I've never used a phone case in my life.
Also, I have adhd and tend to hyperfocus on really weird things, like my phone's battery life, lol.
@Roush14. No. I rarely use wifi. My wifi is off and data is on.
With the s pen... So when your on the page you want to screens shot just go to air command and click screen write. Then you can edit it etc as well. Edit. you can also screen shot full webpages with the spen...
Carrier is Rogers, I'm Canadian - Essentially ATT. I assumed as much. Samsung spends so much money on hardware but seems years behind with software. The theming is pathetic... And the lockscreen and settings are sad. Still like the phone but its very bitter sweet.
Definitely. Marshmallow will help a ton if we ever get it 
Choetech for sure. Edit: but I always think Chodetech when I see my charger now.
I just powered off my phone and tried to locate it and it says location unavailable.  Also I tried to locate the phone with location disabled and it couldn't find it, so hopefully you've left your location on!  (i don't see why it can't automatically turn it on when requesting access for device location)If you are serious about your phone, get a friend or family member to your validated computer and log in to your android device manager before it dies.  
My fianc??e got the S6 edge plus, loved it, but missed the Spen and ended up switching to a Note 5. Doesn't regret it at all. 
I've had my pen for hours not be fully locked in and it was just out. Never fell out tho
The advantage of the Verizon messaging app is it will do messaging over any internet access not just mobile network. However I still don't use it because last time I did the ui was extremely frustrating. Default Samsung messaging app for simplicity and pop up replyAs far as I am aware it is the only way to get Verizon texting over  WiFi
Yeah mine arrived in pretty bad timing. I got my card the day my project fi went through and I received my nexus. So I added the bank of America card got the promo used samsung pay for a few days. Then I canceled the card and I will be on fi for a few months 
No screen protector.  Take pen out, doesn't respond to finger, does respond to pen.
I really would like swipe left for google now on nova launcher.
Why would that affect WiFi speeds?
Don't even have case yet.  I've tried it with every cable I've got, with wall chargers, upside down, screen side first, you name it haha.  It's frustrating not being able to troubleshoot to certainty.
It supports NFC payments as well which many retailers are rolling out too. It's nice that it works both ways during the transition.
How is having a bunch of apps open and switching between them using the recent apps button different from what you describe?  I'm not noticing any issues switching between apps, even with numerous apps in use/background.  I stream MLB live for hours on end with no issues, while switching between text and facebook with no issues.  I'm not saying the issue doesn't exist anywhere, but I can say I've used it in a manner that some have said will cause crashing, and it is still flipping fast with no interruption.
Yeah it was a paid app for a while until a year or two ago when they went free and started selling themes in their theme store IIRC.
Excuse me? Not sure what value that comment serves. But perhaps Google does not know every bug plaguing their software and users don't always know that the problem is in fact impacting other users. So don't bring that attitude here and certainly not towards me. 
My Note 5 still had around 45% after being off charge from 7am to around 11pm yesterday.This includes 2minutes of browsing Reddit in the morning, about 4minutes of playing games during my lunch break and a couple of hours playing Asphalt 8 after work. This is in addition to texting and checking Reddit sporadically throughout the day.So far, I've been pretty impressed with the battery life considering the 1440p screen resolution and the not particularly impressive battery size.Like PatricianCat said, these people complaining probably spend most of their time playing around with their phone.Edit: Forgot to mention playing Pixel Dungeon for 30ish minutes before bed :)
It's weird. I bought two phones and signed up for the charger on day 1 of the promo. Two days later, I signed up again for the second phone. The only one that has shipped so far is the latter.
Yea the sound is pretty cool, and Newport is lovely. 
Yes I have, made it a tad taller aka Nexus 6p height. Got it at 30% off on black Friday. 
Switching my network mode fixed it. I hope it's a permanent fix. But yes, I'm eagerly waiting for Doze in Marshmallow.
It's not any more special than any previous version really, but new versions are always fun :) Marshmallow comes with Doze, which can significantly boost battery performance (my Nexus 7 on Marshmallow lasts about 40% longer than it did before Marshmallow) so that's pretty exciting. It also generally performs a bit better all around... also, rumor is that the memory management problems that currently exist on the Note 5 (which most people frankly don't notice) are resolved too. 
Have you disabled any packages/apps? I think Screen Off Memo is more a function of Action Memo, than S Note. Maybe you disabled one of those packages or services?
I have the Ringke Fusion and I love it. Plus, it had little cover slots that cover the micro USB and earphone slot, so no dust gets into them. 
Which update? Can't be 6.0!?
Which type of TG do you use? The spigen one seemed like it had to be put on way too precisely. I've always used the plastic ones and have only broken a screen once, the one time I didn't have any protector at all on. So I have a plastic one on right now until I can do more research on a TG that will work. Love this phone too much to risk it!!
No effect for me. Though it does take up like 250mb if ram to run though. 
I've noticed that happens when I record using any third party app but not when using the default camera. I've searched through package disabler but I can't find anything that might be the problem. 
Give it a bit, or call PNC and ask them to help you. This is their first day, so they may be having some hiccups. Edit: You might want to restart your phone and try again. I had to restart my phone this morning before I could use Samsung Pay, I assume it was because of the changes they applied.
Thanks for the tip...still wish it was Marshmallow 
I bought a wizgear mount. It has a piece of metal that fits between the case. The magnets are in the round mount.In order to get wireless charging to work with this I had to use tin snips to cut the piece of metal and place it at the very bottom of the case. It doesn't hold quite as well but it works for me. 
I have the Outlook app for my Hotmail. Using the new files tab, I tried downloading a file that I had saved in Outlook and it froze my phone for about ten seconds as well. 
I just bought a 9208 Duos Taiwan version from Amazon and I'm in the USA.  The seal on the box said it was for Southeast Asian SIM Card Only and a leaflet inside the box stated I would have to activate it using a SIM card from a SE Asian operator.  Just got off the phone with Samsung support and basically the guy told me I'd have to take it to Malaysia or Taiwan to activate it and then I could use it in the states.  Really?  Anyone else experienced anything like this?
True I hadn't looked into how it requires samsung just instead of your pin code. That is quite strange. You didn't turn off mobile data or location? Have you tried to find or unlock it using android manager? 
What games did you get? 
Note 5 doesn't support mhl. So the only way to get video out would be miracast.
Didn't work for me today. I went to my recent apps and forced closed each one but the left corner was still messed up. I couldn't get it back until I restarted.
Either Samsung quality control is completely terrible and t-mobile got a batch of really bad phones... or is possible counterfeit phone have somehow entered t-mobile stores. So glad I didn't do an online purchase and run into the same issue. So much better to do a return in store.
How's network signal? Weak ones mean your phone has to work harder 
I just switched a couple of weeks ago and use the app my contacts backup it's very easy just download the app, click the backup button and email it to yourself then when she sets her new phone up open the email and open the attachment it will upload all of her contacts to the new phone.For the notes I set up evernote on iPhone and copied and pasted all my notes in there and then signed in on my Note 5 and copied and pasted them back in to the Notes note app.As far as pictures I didn't transfer any over as I don't take many pictures so sorry can't help you there 
It doesn't say fast wireless charging... Just wireless charging. 
Night and day, not really. But animations seem to be more uniform across the OS. Processes don't seem to hang as they did on the Note 4. When you tap on apps, they just open, no lag. I'd often get typing lag on the Note 4 as well and I don't experience that anymore. The only annoyance is that the phone takes several seconds to wake up after pressing the power button. My Note 2 did this and it was seriously irritating. I believe it's just a 5.1.1. thing though. I got the Note 5 for free but I wouldn't say it's worth the upgrade otherwise from the 4.
Battery optimization looks interesting. Wondering how well it'll work 
If you're talking photos, Google Photos. If you are talking documents, Dropbox. And here's a shameless Dropbox referral in case you're interested: https://db.tt/LflqUgvm
I found a fix for the Google Play battery drain that will still sync email and anything else you want. First, make sure your phone is set to have WiFi off during sleep. (This is a huge battery saver by itself, and is also required for this fix). Next, go to your Mobile Data settings, tap on Google Play or Google Play Services, and tap Restrict Background Data so it is set to off. Since GPS now has no way to access the Internet when the phone is off, it will stop wakelocking the phone and killing battery. However, all Google and 3rd party apps will continue to sync as usual. Hope this helps you as it did for me! If you're at all concerned about sync using your mobile data, you can go to Settings&gtAccounts&gtGoogle and select the specific Google apps to allow syncing for.
I have the same problem on a Verizon variant of the Note 5. It says that cell standby is using my battery but when I turn off wifi it improves considerably.  Can someone tell me how to set up static IP?  Do I have to be rooted? 
I went from an LG G3 to the Note 5. I actually liked LG's UI modifications but find Touchwiz is very limiting. Currently running nova launcher for an AOSP-ish experience. Still have to deal with the weird settings menu. I also strongly prefer the on-screen home button to the physical one. That said, the Note 5 is beautiful, the pen can be genuinely useful, and the fingerprint reader is fast and mostly trouble free. 
This is Clean Master most likely. Do you have it installed?
I'm familiar with the fixing of the S-pen when placed backwards.  I'm more worried about it getting stuck the correct way.  Sigh. I'm leaning towards the 6p now since you can end back a bent phone per say. And I can also get Nexus protect on the device. That would give me peace of mind.  
wait my amazon rewards card is a visa so I cant use it. what is yours?
Did you use the default camera app?  What settings?
My problem is MortPlayer for Audiobooks seems to have issue with the Note  5 and about a third of the time requires a reset before it will actually play.  Otherwise it just sets there showing the pause button like it's playing but not advancing...   I had a similar problem with the Note 3 until I had the phone for about 3 months and got some update to the phone that actually fixed the problem.  So I have to reset quite frequently and it's a real pain in the ass...
I've had no issue with crashes at all, I did have a problem with opponents using the september cardback causing the game to glitch out badly (id have to restart if they used that cardback) but I havent noticed it since this weeks patch so I think its fixed.  This issue seemed to effect all the current gen samsung phones.Also, I use Samungs Game Tuner from the play store, its available for their current gen exynos phones and allows you to change the resolution and fps on each game and save the settings.  I put hearthstone at 480p res instead of 1080p to save battery life and the graphical difference is very minimal.  It's a great utility for note 5/s6 owners.  You can also use it to bump up the res from default 1080p to the notes full 2k (or whatever they call it) resolution.
Hm. Never got the update but found SP in the play Store over the weekend and it works. 
Would it work if I uninstalled Knox? 
One slightly long press on the home button will both wake the phone and read your fingerprint.  It's not as fast as the lightning quick iPhone 6s, but neither is the iPhone 6.  I usually don't need to open the phone that quickly, so I usually tap the home button to wake it, view the lock screen for notifications, and then lightly set my finger over the scanner to unlock.  Coming from having used the S5's fingerprint scanner, this is a godsend.
I don't know if there's a faster way to do this, but you can open an app in pop-up mode, and then hit the circle at the top and it'll open up four options, the second of which is the minimize button.This will work on most apps, just drag from the top corner, or press the button on the top right of any card that supports it in the multitasking tray, then hit the circle at the top middle of the window. 
Download any of the screen off and lock apps and set the double tap gesture in Nova to point to it. Then you can double tap the screen to turn it off...no need to hit the power/lock button anymore.

UPDATE: As of this morning, I can send pictures and receive MMS from non iPhone users, but cannot receive or send MMS to iPhones.
Please refer to this thread regarding the battery life. https://redd.it/3s1wkm
Unfortunately, there's no mention of battery optimizations, nor can I find any app optimization options in the battery settings like T-Mobile Notes got. It seems like ATT also kept Samsung's Smart Manager app out of the update.
I still have problems with this periodically. I use to have an iPhone and now I have a Galaxy S6. My regular texts work just fine but about once a month I stop getting group texts. I have to have everyone delete the thread and start it over. Very frustrating. All of my contacts except one are iPhone people. 
im unlocked and in settings-&gtlegal i have a few more submenus:- open source licenses- google legal- system webview licenses- wallpapers- samsung legal- safety informationsI checked them all and i cant seem to see any logo...
Certainly seems like a hardware bug.  Given what you have tried I would probably go the route of trying to get it replaced or serviced under the warranty.  Definitely sounds like a hardware malfunction.  Sorry bud.  
Will I lose root if I update through OTA?
Anyone know if it will be down to $1 somewhere else for Black Friday? 
Here's an album I put together with some of my better pictures. All are unedited, but a few, such as the the car pictures at night, were taken using pro mode, so I could adjust shutter speed to capture more light as the areas for those were quite dark!http://imgur.com/a/VaTpY
So download this app, quick shortcut maker, from the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sika524.android.quickshortcut). There is a search bar up top, search for vr. Your gona see a few apps and that means your set for vr . If you want to set up vr and download apps before your get your gear click on Gear VR SetupWizzard and go through the process. Enjoy :)
This has been happening to me as well. I thought it was just the click mechanism in the S Pen though, so I bought a spare one. Haven't had issues with the new one.
Previously on iPhone 5s. Love the size, functionality, camera, freedom to tweak, etc. My one and heavy complaint is messaging. Coming from iOS and having many group messages going, I have not received many messages. Also, sending pictures over message, which was so easy and great with imessage, is terrible. I have switched to Facebook messenger for sending photos but the ease of imessage was great
As far as syncing contacts I would recommend using the cable that they gave you and just sync it directly from your phone.You should also look up an app called isyncr since it would easily transfer your songs. I know they have a PC app, but unsure about apple version (I don't see why not). The only downside is the free version is extremely limited and you may need the paid one.http://www.jrtstudio.com/iSyncr-iTunes-for-Android
If you can't see and feel it pulsing, it's not ready. Also, make sure you are holding it directly over the center of the card slot. If you get a card read error or the transaction fails, call your bank first, then call and report it to Samsung Pay support. I'm still having some issues with my Navy Federal debit card not working at some places where my other credit/debit cards do work, so it could be a formatting issue on your particular card, but most likely you are not holding it in the right location. Also, be sure your bank fully activated your card on Samsung Pay.
The new feature is that when you open up recent tabs, your other tabs will be there.  I don't even know if they are going to make Samsung pay work with it. I'm just waiting for Android pay to be compatible with Chase.
That's not bad. I need at least 32GB for music and images, and seeing how over 10GB is already taken up in the 32GB model, I would need a 64GB model. This is why I'm asking but couldn't find any information on Google. Thanks for the input. 
I listen to hours of podcasts every day. Seems to be pretty battery intensive, much more so than it was on my iphones.
I'm assuming you've rebooted and confirmed the pen recognizes when you remove and replace the pen?  You may have to factory reset as well just to check there isn't a hardware issue.
Try deleting some fingerprints and re-adding them. You'll have to keep at least one. Then you should be able to continue. After you add new ones, delete the old one and replace it.
Yeah the cables are bloody useless these days. 
I have activated my Samsung pay account. Hope I get one as well. Regardless I've already bought a cheaper wireless charger on amazon that works like a charm. $25 and with fast charging. 
If software matters more to you, get the 6P. It will get faster updates, and you don't have to worry about managing the bloatware that comes on the note 5. On the flip side, bloatware IS manageable on the Note 5 and Touchwiz isn't that bad, honestly. If hardware matters more to you, get the Note 5. Its camera is king, screen and processor are better, power use is better optimised for the hardware, and it has extras like wireless charging, heart rate sensor, S Pen and magnetic strip emulator. On the flip side, the 6P hardware is strong too. TL:DR they're both awesome phones, I think you'll be happy either way. 
Samsung Pay.  It's great showing that feature off.  I do it to all the cashiers that say they don't take payments because their terminals are not NFC capable and only use mag stripe.  The look on their face after I successfully use it, as  MasterCard commercials use to say: Priceless.
I've had mine since launch day and I DO NOT use a case.I've dropped it twice, once from about two feet of the ground (slid out of my shirt pocket as I was bent over) and once it got knocked off the kitchen table. One landing was on cement (the first) and the other on a typical kitchen floor. Neither time caused any more damage than some scratches to the metal edges. The fall from my shirt landed flat on the screen, I'm not sure what the other landing looked like. I definitely don't think this is a phone you want to be dropping... as others have said, all glass isn't a good thing for durability... but, given my experience, I don't think it's quite as fragile as you might expect. 
No external storage, I've disabled bloatware. Just popped up one day and I uninstalled all the apps I've recently installed but it's still showing up
It's insane how much battery life varies from user to user. I thought I was doing well with 5/5.5 hours screen on time consistently, but looks like you're doing twice as much. 
Yeah, battery life was inconsistent for sure, 6P beats it there. 
I came from a Note4. Losing the SD card,  replaceable battery,  and IR blaster hasn't bothered me one bit. There really isn't any other phone on the market that can match the Note5's four gigs of LPDDR4 ram, the display, or processor speed. 
Are you guys able to group chat with iPhone users?
I LOVE this case, too - but it has no kickstand.I considered the Spigen Slim Armor - but the pictures made it look pretty clunky.  A friend has the purple one for her S6 and I think it is quite unattractive.  :(
Most demo units I see have several GBs of demo apps, videos, etc, so that sounds normal. My T-Mobile unit is using 7.24GB of system memory, but demo units I saw had like 12-13GB I think.
I don't have the fast version of the choetech but I do have the regular version of it and it runs circles around the Samsung branded one. Placement of the phone is a non issue with the choetech while the Samsung was very picky about how the phone lay on the charger. I'm looking at buying the choetech fast wireless charger but at this point, I only use the wireless one while sleeping so speed is a non issue for me during the night. 
thats from the setting that makes it when you turn the device it moves the bakground based on how you look at it. but it doesnt move the icons which is what burned
I have a gold note5. Had a clear case. Was quite annoying. Upgraded to this case. Hides a lot of the look of the phone but it's very comfortable and I feel safe with it

&gtyour USB cable is a crappy 3rd party charging cable. Fix: Get a better USB cable that's capable of data transfer.........wow I'm stupid, I was using my battery pack cable...Thanks for the help!
Suppose to have the same screen but only reviews will tell how it compares (calibration).  6P has a larger battery as well but the 81might eat that up. Really there's no saying which is better till reviews and even then you have to put your own weight on each thing.  
Yeah, I can wait though, wasn't able to do it before as I was waiting for Verizon to approve samsung pay 
I haven't received the update, but I was able to download and activate my card from this link
**Sixty to ninety minutes??** For what? I was thinking something like one minute. Plus, a photographer is a *skilled professional*. Scraping a sticker off a piece of glass doesn't require skill.
Using the charger that came with it. I have it plugged in now, but is says it's slow charging. I'll check it on my girlfriend's s6 when I can, I'm pretty sure it's something with the phone though. 
I'm reasonably certain you're trolling here but come on man.  For the record, I LOVE the black sapphire blue back.  to each their own.
The model number is on the film but the samsung logo is on the glass!
I thought Sprint and AT&ampT use different technologies, and so even if you could unlock it, I don't think it would work on their network. Correct me if I'm wrong
Really? I find Nova Launcher to work so efficiently with my Note 5. I like Google Now launcher as well, that's a cool one to use. I love the customization on the Nova Launcher though so I'm continuing to use that one.
No but this seems to be the only way so I will try it. Is it as simple as unrooting again to keep warranty? 
No I mean what's holding the glass down, I don't see the adhesive. Lol 
[Keymonk keyboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keymonk.latin&amphl=en) handles simultaneous typing of both thumbs. The only problem is that it hasn't been updated in years, has no emojis and whatever. But yeah, I wish more keyboards went after this rather than just swiping 1 line at a time. Especially with the larger display, this works
Well, then what are you talking about. There's no unhack option in the security settings. 
Gotcha. Not sure if it takes up storage, but if it did it would be a waste. No problem. Not sure on the specifics, but glad I could help.
Is that also where the MST is?
Removable battery has not been an issue at all for me. Battery life has been at least as good as my Note 4, which is good enough to get through a day of regular use. I top off with the fast charger if I need to extend my day. No SD card has been a non issue, and I have the 32 GB size. If you are the kind of person that has to have every song and movie they've ever owned on one device, this might be a problem eventually. I am keeping everything I do up in the cloud and storing nothing on the device. So far so good. You will definitely enjoy the 5 after owning the Note for so long. 
if you could give me like a few more words of assistance, that would be much appreciated. I suspect you are wrong that I can flash it myself.* Note5 for ATT is not unlockable, not rootable (AFAIK)* Odin appears to be for installing custom roms, which appears to require root, which I can't do (afaik)* please just spoon feed me a little bit more because I promise I have some vague idea of what I'm doing, I used to install custom roms on my Nexus devices all the time (used adb, used twrp, tried a dozen different custom roms, etc) ... but the ATT Note5 is, to the best of my knowledge, locked up pretty tightly.
Went caseless the other day right after my ringke slim broke due to the lag time of getting my Spigen from Amazon into Jamaica. It was a pretty interesting two weeks, I don't think I've ever been so careful with a phone my entire life, I must say I love the feel of the phone out of the case and its a beautiful phone, whenever I walk and text people always stop me and ask me what phone that is and admire it's beauty. I became use to having the case off but I had one single annoyance, and no it wasn't the fingerprints. It was the bezels or the lack there of to be honest ?????? Trying to use the phone with one hand is a nightmare, parts of my palm always touch the screen causes it's so close to the edge and it annoys me 
you have a note, and did a screen shot, and didn't even draw a circle around what you are referring to? i don't get it.
I just came from the note 4 to the note 5.. spend the extra money go with the note 5. Yes the expandable memory was nice but the speed difference and the smoothness of this phone is just way to good.. oh and also the camera shits on every camera out there even the iPhone 6s plus. 
They are currently in the process of getting a system dump from his update.He had no IEMI, so he flashed back to coi5. When he booted, he got a notice for an update, but instead of getting LP, it updated him to MM.[The XDA post](http://forum.xda-developers.com/tmobile-galaxy-note5/general/note-5-marshmallow-dump-t3249840)
Nice.  It's not just the note, most new phones support LTE-Advanced I think it is, and all 3 bands on sprint.  It's just nice having more than the phone be an upgrade, the network went from crap to really fast.  Having unlimited data might actually mean something now.
I had 2 workers at the verizon store advise me to not use the vzw messaging app when I got my note 5. They told me it's a huge pile of junk and they would advise using the standar android messages app.Edit: so many people suggested textra so I downloaded it and tried it. I now suggest using textra, it's amazing.
Watch some [reviews](https://youtu.be/RsW-DW064_Q)It comes down to features, SD card, removable battery.If you take a ton of pics and videos, have your music stores in your phones memory or sd card then it is a no brainer.
:( does AT&ampT sell unlocked variants, or...? Would you know how the process of replacing for an unlocked model would go?
The OTA applied WITH stuff disabled? I'm surprised to hear that if so... normally the system checksum will fail with even one thing disabled, but if that's not the case then that's good news. Maybe only certain things are a problem, maybe somewhere along the line that rule changed entirely, I'm not sure, but if I'm wrong then that's totally cool :) I don't think I'd be worried about it causing problems though... you'd almost certainly have seen them already if there was going to be any. 
I'm fairly certain hardware wise the screens are the same between both units as well as the camera. They improved the software.
I have a dbrand skin on the front and back, but no case or anything. Slight damage from a drop (I think) near the spen. 
Looks great!How did you get the clear glass back to stick, when you put it back on the phone. I assume some kind of adhesive, but what/where/how?
I am 100% confident I will be able to ditch my wallet completely using Samsung Pay. The two or three times I actually use my card in a week will be easily done. 
This is dope. Wonder if it's a battery drainer?
Once you root, knox is permanently tripped, so Samsung Pay is lost forever.  You can find the latest Odin version on the Note 5 XDA subsection, along with tutorials.  As far as bricking, Odin is used to recover from bricks, so you're relatively safe unless you REALLY fuck up bad, which is hard to do.
is there a task manager you can show me? like a screenshot of what using how much RAM
There's a teardown and repair video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQcbGNuI3JEI can't tell you whether your camera is actually damaged, but you can get a replacement glass cover here: http://www.repairsuniverse.com/samsung-galaxy-note-5-rear-camera-lens-cover-frame.htmlIt should come in 2 parts one piece is the actual glass itself, and a separate metal frame. If you can peel off the rest of the broken glass you might be able to just glue the new one onto the existing frame without having to disassemble anything.
Oh yeah I'm definitely taking it back. Just bought it today. It's really distracting when reading stuff on a white background since the color shift happens with the tiniest movement and is really prominent. But was wondering if a normal procedure with something like this would be repair or replacement. 
I believe it's the adapter/cable combo. Some people disagree with me, but I've tried various cables and only the quick charge or fast charge cables will initiate fast charging for my phone 
The time spent buying them, making them clear, listing them on eBay, buying packing materials and boxing then shipping them significantly cuts down the profit. EBay will take $5 for every one sold. PayPal takes $1.75. That $25 profit is now $18.25. He may of had to pay sales tax to buy them. That can be a few dollars. If he messes one up or it gets lost in transit that's a big hit to profit. That's not going to get him rich.
Could be the bubbles effect on your lock screen try disabling lock screen sounds.

Depending on your handwriting, I wouldn't count on it to convert handwriting to text on important stuff. I chicken scratch like crazy, and l have to frequently rewrite things the software can't read. Totally a me problem, but if you were to just write notes on the screen, it should work out just fine.Fun fact: l used my stylus to write this, and even being careful l have to edit on the fly, which to me is too inefficient for dictating and class notes.
You're essentially creating the note with the screen off function then attaching it to a note in keep correct? The out put isn't directly to keep is it
I purchased an N920I from eBay, will work with 4g on Three and EE (or t mobile/orange) but it won't work with Vodafone or O2. I didn't realise this, I was with Vodafone and had to wait for my contract to expire ad then went with EE. 4G now works perfectly.
[At the moment, is seems Samsung is not currently allowing any new users, as downloads have been frozen, at least on our end.](http://www.droid-life.com/2015/10/19/samsung-pay-now-available-on-google-play/) 
I keep it in basic power saving all the time. I find it doesn't noticeably slow anything down and I now hardly ever run out of battery before bedtime. Huge difference in hours of usage for me.
Would you say this is more accurate band list - http://pdadb.net/index.php?m=specs&ampid=8704&ampview=1&ampc=samsung_sm-n920w8_galaxy_note_5_lte-a_samsung_nobleI will find out tomorrow anyway but it would be good not to have to worry about sending it back before i even have it haha
I like the feeling of no case but at the same time...once the fingerprints start to accumulate it gets slippy etc.
At what brightness level?
Nothing seems different from those screenshots. If this were true, why wouldn't the guy be showing new things - like app backup settings? 
As someone who's used 3 (yes, 3!) of their black leather Note 5 skins, I can say that's definitely not normal. Their customer service is great, I'm sure they'll help you out.
I don't doubt that it's the best, but it doesn't mean the lack of Glove Mode won't bother me. It's been on the S4, Note 3, S5, Note 4. Why remove it? Samsung should hire more Canadian testers.As for voice commands, I'll use that tricks for the regular camera, but that won't really help me when I'm trying to do photospheres (Google Camera).
I have the [jetech tempered glass](http://www.amazon.com/Protector-JETech%C2%AE-Premium-Tempered-Samsung/dp/B0132XCT0U) one. It does have a slight halo effect, but I truly don't notice it unless the screens off and/or I'm really looking for it. It may bother you if your a stickler, but I agree with the thousands of reviewers who gave it a thumbs up. 
I can't honestly say which themes caused the problem, because it's been a while since I've used Themer. I stopped using it after I found serious battery loss on my s5. Removing  the app reduced excessive heating and battery drain...
I wish I had a cleaner idea but I access almost all of these at least twice a day.[Colors look a little washed on my monitor :(](http://i.imgur.com/ttMzWcQ.png)
It's made of glass, front and back. It has great build quality,  feels great in hand, and is very reliable. But, it is made of glass,  front and back. No amount of anecdotal evidence will change that fact. Unless it's in a case,  I wouldn't recommend dropping it. 
That would scratch horribly. Just pull off your cracked glass and replace it with a new one, then your phone is as good as new.
Honest question: won't the battery degrade faster with quick charge?  What then? 
I constantly bump the mute button with my cheek. Maybe that is the cause?
I got the Anker wireless charger on Amazon for $12 and couldn't be happier. It's slow charge, but I only use it on my nightstand, so speed isn't an issue. Never had any problems with it not being charged. Anker Wireless Charger PowerPort Qi Wireless Charging Pad  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Y839YMU/ref=cm_sw_r_other_awd_XSyiwbGAX6719
Just use it for a few days and see how you like it.  It is very lean, and very much in line with the rest of the material design formats, so you'll have no trouble getting the hang of the UI.
6-7 hrs.  Posted my album of PDP functions [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxynote5/comments/3nrmk3/with_package_disabler_pro_i_got_7_hours_of_screen/)
Never heard of slayer, gonna check them out. Any particular song I should listen to?Now for serious question: have you used samsung pay with it? How well does it work?
Telegram is a great replacement for iChat and is cross platform.
It's most likely your root. I do not have my Note 5 rooted, but speaking from experience, something went wrong or something is unstable. I've read that there is a kernal that is causing people problems like random reboots that you are getting. What kernal are you running?EDIT: found the info, noble kernel causes reboots apparently. People claim arter97 kernel works well. Try flashing that before you reset to stock.
I see there is already a thread for this. These people were lucky to not have the pen stuck inside the phone. https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxynote5/comments/3n6s3r/has_this_happened_to_anyone_else/ 
Same for me today as well Android system went nuts on my battery. I usually do pretty well. 
Agreed, it looks and feels an awful lot like plastic
The problem is google designs these firmwares for their phones such as nexus. Other companies not only have to modify the firmware to work with their buttons and hardware, they have to fully test many different apps to get it to work. If they push an update that breaks a lot of phones, the update actually does more wrong to them than it does good to us.
I'm looking at recommending the Note 5 (mainly for its size, stylus, and fucking awesome camera) to a friend.&gtI average about 5 hours SOT most days with a wide variety of usage... plenty of web surfing and eMail, Facebook and Twitter (Twitter via app, Facebook via web site), some casual gaming, plenty of music playing (almost all of it with the screen on), some nav and map stuff, all typical stuffThat sounds great! If you were to take Fb and Twitter and gaming out of there, do you think you could make 6 hours? She doesn't use any of those and primarily sticks to photos, emails, web browsing and music videos.
My note 5 runs cool as a cucumber, and the screen is just jaw droppingly beautiful.  The build quality is great and im getting fantastic battery life.  I just played hearthstone for nearly 2 hours straight and only lost 25% battery.  6+ hours OST gaming!I use the stylus several times a week in meetings, beats having to carry around pen and paper.The only thing the G4 has that I want is the knock on/off feature.
Disabled about all pink services in package disabler, disabled the Wi-Fi search and location stuff. Screen brightness only at about 5% of the brightness bar. Mostly use Reddit in dark mode, dark wallpaper, dark theme. Make sure you enable the OLED setting in the Reddit app.
I'm not really willing to test it, but isn't it waterproof by itself?Ref: https://youtu.be/1I1NSiSZiAA
I have a QC 2.charger in my car and it says Fast Charging  Now is it the same or a little slower than the Samsung charger im not sure, It charges fast. 
I set it to never optimize and it's still stopping the music, 4 times so far today. I pull up the app and hitting play it'll start at the beginning of the cut off song.
What is doze
&gtThe S6 Active is capable of Samsung Pay...  You might want to tell Samsung this, because they list it as not having the feature.  I can personally confirm it does not have the feature.  It *does* support Android Pay, but Android Pay != Samsung Pay.&gtNot sure what Verizon has to do with anything...  OP was talking about differences between Note5 and rumored Note5 Active.  I think limited availability is a factor, if not for OP, than others who read this sub.
Same here. Battery life doesn't even come close the Note 5. 
I think the camera is a big upgrade. The Note 4 does take excellent photos, but I often found them to be quite noisy, even in very good light. I suspect this is due to lots of processing. The Note 5 doesn't have this issue -- the photos are just excellent. It can even take images in relatively low light with hardly any noise at all.The S Pen isn't drastically different it looks nicer now, but it doesn't actually do a lot more than before.
They only come in 32 or 64gb variants, and I use the tech21 case paired with a tempered glass screen protector, and it's wonderfully protected. Also you can get two years 10gb (I think 100) storage on one drive also, for cloud needs 
Yeah it only slow charges unless I'm using the Samsung charger. BTW is your name a reference to the program on the old Tech TV  channel? 
When you pinch in and look at your home screen, scroll to the right and make a new page then drag your page that you want to be home to the right of that. After that just press the little home icon at the top to select your home page of choice.
Yeah that's what I ended up doing. No custom ROM yet. Just root and arter kernel.
I got the Note 5 32gb (International version unlocked) for $535 , cheaper than a Nexus 6p 32gb after taxes.
I don't know anything about your carrier, but CDMA doesn't allow simultaneous voice and data. That's just a limitation of the technology. 
Also keep in mind that you lose ability to replace battery and SD card memory upgrade since all newer phones don't have access to the back.  There are rumors that Samsung is considering bringing back access to either the battery or memory card in the next version of the galaxy s7 or note 6. S7 would probably drop in April 
You could possibly use Tasker and create an app using Tasker App Factory and add the app to the shortcut in the air command menu. 
I've taken pictures from that same spot. It turned out well!
Looks like pro mode,  dropped the shutter speed to get some artistic motion artifact 
I was sworn off Samsung after having the sgs 1 through to 3 due to tw,  I then went full nexus with the 4,7 and 5 then a lg g pro 2...lets just say i actually enjoy TW on the note 5, it's very minimal and adds so many features missing from stock. I did notice lag when I first got this thing but installing a new kernel seems to help a great deal and I highly recommend it. All you really need is to install xposed and wanam module as it adds quite a few tw tweaks (like enabling multi window on all apps). If you want multi user support you can install Ditto Rom and Samsung has a new app called Game Tuner that let's you play with on the fly resolutions and fps. This is the first android device that I actually love and I've had quite a few (around 15)The only niggles are no external SD which I fixed by buying a Seagate wireless plus 1tb drive...Samsung has a 1.5tb wireless drive that also let's you charge USB devices but I returned that as I could never get it working. I also have a external battery bank to charge the phone but I rarely use it as I could get a day out of it (8-10hr SoT), I heard the nexus 6p is nothing special when it comes to battery. 
The best depends on what you're looking for in terms of features. For me, the best is Dropbox.Dropbox and Google Drive are priced comparably for 1TB of storage ($9.99/month). Dropbox offers a discount if you pay by the year. Microsoft is catching a lot of flak for changes to their storage quotas recently, so I'd avoid OneDrive.Do you intend on using the cloud storage on your PC as well? You should. Only Dropbox allows bandwidth throttling (both ways, too), so that when it's syncing it won't kill all your bandwidth. This was the deciding factor for me. Both Dropbox and Google Drive integrate well into Android and iOS alike, as well as Windows. Dropbox is also available for Linux. There are unofficial Google Drive clients available for Linux.Dropbox, unknown to most users, also is able to be used as a CDN (content delivery network). If you have any large files to share, or want to offload some website content into the public folder of your dropbox, you're allowed to do that. Not only will the files be served faster, the bandwidth limits are much much higher than most hosts (250GB per day for a pro account).Both Google Drive and Dropbox allow full access to all your files from any device, with built in viewers. Drive may get the edge when it comes to editing documents and spreadsheets directly in the app. Third party apps easily solve this limitation.I hope this information helps. I personally recommend Dropbox. If you decide to try Dropbox (even a free account), you can use this link to get a bonus 500mb for free (disclaimer: this also gives me 1GB, since it's a referral link): https://db.tt/mCbGrX1
You're not alone. Great phone but this battery is awful, even after all the recommendations from this forum. 
Hmmmm. I posted this possible solution on another reddit thread and had someone confirm that force closing the Messenger app worked for them as well. Anyhow, it's just an idea. Hoping to get more people to test it out for me because I've only tried this solution once. I have a feeling it's some app that is causing this. Doesn't sound like a hardware issue based on mine and others' experiences. Just trying to narrow it down. Thanks!
I kept all of my data and apps.  Unfortunately it trips Knox which voids your warranty and makes it so Samsung pay won't work.
Thanks.  It just sucks because I would rather use that than the fingerprint reader which does not work very well for me.
I thought Samsung offered the full version for free through samsung apps, at least I got it for free on my Note 5.
Please give more info. From the photo it looks like you have gotten pretty good battery life. 
I used my buddy's Note 10.1 2014 s Pen on my Note 5 when I lost my S Pen.  Worked just fine.  In fact, I went on Amazon and picked up a cheap, previous gen S Pen to keep in my pen case for school, so that I can write down quick notes in class without pulling my S Pen out.  
The lip on the case is the best part. That's what will protect the screen.
I still have immaculate scratch free devices  that are ten years old but this thing has a death wish ! I picked it up but fumbled and dropped it a few cm back on to the desk with a case on. Pen popped out and was a little wonky from then. I ordered a new pen and then an Otterbox the same day. In all seriousness though - it was entirely my fault and I'm glad the phone itself is fine. 
I haven't used the fingerprint scanner yesterday because I realized how much easier it is for me to just unlock it with a swipe. I love fingerprint but it was giving me detection issues I think. 
How did you get the clear glass back to stick, when you put it back on the phone. I assume some kind of adhesive, but what/where/how?
I use the defender otterbox on my note 5. It makes it a big rubber brick, but for what I paid for the thing, i cant risk dropping it. I do love the feeling of no case though. 
An easy way to boost this is use dark screen apps if possible. I use sync for Reddit amoled mode and a third party twitter app for the same. Chrome seems to be your biggest app drain I'm not sure what the use case is but maybe an RSS reader with amoled mode could help? I'm getting 5.5-6 hours screen time by doing this with Bluetooth for a pebble watch on. 
Sounds a lot like my usage and I'm doing fine. I'm on tmobile and system memory uses up 7.24gb.  
Have fun waiting for your promotional item. Mine has been back ordered since I got the phone and did it (October 2nd). Update: Just got an email that mine just shipped... Did they see my reddit postUpdate 2: Got home and had two bubble envelopes sitting on my doorstep. Apparently instead of white or black they sent me white and black... yay two free chargers
Huh. Well I spoke too soon, Poweramp seems to be working fine. I was skeptical since both dDsub and Shuttle had the same glitch issue, but I guess Poweramp handles it differently from Samsung. Much thanks!
Yeah, I know. I meant more Nova vs GNL. I tried the TW launcher for a day or so, but the massive gap between the bottom row of apps and the dock just really didn't sit with me. So much wasted space!
I have that same issue but only when my bluetooth is connected to something. 
I've only had the phone a week so these are just the things I've showed off so far.Also if they're into gaming maybe show off how well PPSSPP runs on  with ROMs.Also minor feature but definitely better than iPhone: sorting the notification bar into your preferred order.
I'm not following this... If I already purchased can I still be eligible? My payments are higher than what is stated, but I was told by the rep that everyone was technically on JoD. I kept my plan, got a new Note 5, and was told that I could ditch it after 18 months
Is this more relatable for you?If the card slot flat and on the right (imagine a man laying in bed on his side, so his ass is pointing to the right, his butt crack is the card slot, and you'd have to swipe your card with the magnetic strip facing the bed and the Visa logo facing the ceiling) - in that situation you should hold the phone so that the power button is facing the floor with the back of the phone centered over the magnetic slot (so the phone would take a well centered picture of the superior half of the man's ass crack and the picture would include both left and right butt cheeks).
One day I'll know enough development to port over Carbon Rom and fix all of our issues. And even keep Knox running... One day...
Had a verizon note 5 and it had bluetooth issues. Would constantly drop the connection and need a repair. Ended up returning it
So as long as the phone is fully paid off or not in a contract, he can't blacklist/ report it missing right? Is there anything in particular I need to check? For example, with iphones, I'd always make sure that the apple id was completely deleted and the phone reset. As long as I reset the note 5, I should be good to go?And I guess going the samsung store would be a waste of time since I could just go to the carrier store and check everything there right?
Open your phone app. Go to MORE in upper right corner, then Settings. Should be in there, not the traditional Settings app. 
Try reading through this thread I posted a few weeks back.  I get 6-7 hours every day of SOT.  https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxynote5/comments/3nrmk3/with_package_disabler_pro_i_got_7_hours_of_screen/
Hi,  if you're still able to answer questions:1. Can you describe how fitness apps interface with the GN5? (accuracy of heart rate,  calories,  step count etc. With S health)  also,  does that t interface with Google health apps at all? 2. How well does S voice work?  Reviews I've read say hit or miss. 3. Do you still own it? 
Can't see it when I click the link. Do I need to uninstall the sideloaded framework to even be able to download it from Google play?
I believe you can still swipe on the screen, its just horizontal swipes instead of vertical swipes.
Thats the adhesive to hold on the back. The wireless chaging ribbon is the big black sticker looking thing on the back of the actual phone
Congratulations on your business. (Not sarcasm) Maybe a portable charger would help you get through the day... I'm not sure we have reached a point where any phone would accommodate the needs of every person. I do think that for most people, yes, this phone is a fucking toy for adults.
Power sharing is a Samsung technology that uses a double ended micro USB to charge other devices off your phone.  Your charging port could be damaged if you're randomly getting these messages. 
Which one did you buy? And can you take pictures of yours? 
YES! This issue is driving me crazy! I recently got a note 5 and sidesync was working fine until about 4 days ago. Now it keeps losing connection and I can't solve the problem! 
Good call for the people that didn't know. A little background. Button combos to reset became an android norm when Android Honeycomb hit, since honeycomb was meant solely for tablets they figured users would need a way to reset when the UI was locked when the device did not have a removable battery.  
Ah, thats not a widget. Its a floating app for network, cpu, and memory usage. Its pretty neat since I can see the stats overlayed over any app.[Resource Monitor Mini](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.kfsoft.android.MemoryIndicator&amphl=en) and [Network Monitor Mini](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.kfsoft.android.TrafficIndicator&amphl=en)
Another option is Airdroid. Has a web app and a native OSX app. Allows for SMS, notifications, file transfers, and more.
I mean if anyone is feeling very generous, this Milwaukee note owner wouldn't mind taking that extra charger off your hands 
If you have TWRP or CWM then you will not be able to install the update. It will download it, but once the system tries to install it will end up going to the recovery that you have installed on your phone. If you have stock recovery, but are rooted, you will definitely lose root.
My MMS within Google Messenger on Verizon is incredibly flaky as well. It's a bummer because I love the UI of Google Messenger, but I had to switch to Textra for now.
Indian version got this a couple weeks ago. Battery lasts a little longer, and there are better optimisation options. Didn't notice much else.
Smart Weather Wallpaper. Great app that changes the background based on the time of day AND the current weather in you area. Really nice and will work on its own or can tie into muzei if that's your thing. 
This is what I'm worried about. The pen itself breaking. I'm not stupid enough to put it in backwards, but if it randomly fails, or breaks apart. Oh well, guess I'll be buying a new one if it breaks. 
If you had it enabled (in terms of having that authentication enabled on your account), maybe its causing issues with syncing of your Google account. So disabling it might cause lots of issues when your phone tries to sync.
Agree, strange they would release it with that user experience.  Really a shame,  beautiful device otherwise.
Me too. I actually keep it in a leather pouch made for the Note 2. It protects the screen while in my pocket and since it is a tight fit it absorbs quite a bit of impact. I did the same with my Note 3 and it was still spotless after 2 years. So I get all the protection I need without losing the pleasure of handling the device. But damn, the back just loves dem fingerprints. Even compulsive hand washing doesn't keep it clean
Thanks for this! I'm hoping I don't have to open up the phone and it is just the lens.  I did order that and a camera incase the camera is damaged.
works perfect on my s4I thought I was finally set on choosing the note 5 for my upgrade in a month and then i came to this sub and it seems like all you guys have issues with so many things. yikes. guess ill keep looking for what to get.
The Choetech wireless charger is fast wireless and is $35 on Amazon
From a 6, I haven't noticed a significant speed boost in either gaming or multitasking. A 6s with more ram and a faster processor, I'm going to be looking very closely at the speed difference. 
Not sure if you can or cannot flash a custom recovery (I am assuming no) but if you cannot root, it essentially will put you into a bootloop IF you could flash the recovery. Not to mention there is currently no way to avoid tripping KNOXI wouldn't even try until a root method (if ever) is found and tested( that doesnt trip knox also)
* 1 - If you're using the phone on T-Mobile, you'll only get wifi calling and VoLTE on the T-Mobile version.  * 2 - If you're buying it outright, T-Mobile will unlock it for you after 4days* 3 - Ebay for the international version, but you'll have missing features and zero warranty.* 4 - Easy as pie for the T-Mobile version, only downside is losing Samsung Pay.  AT&ampT and Verizon's version of the note is unrootable and 100% locked down.  No getting around it (yet), and it doesn't look good.
We include a screen only, screen protector with every Slickwraps purchase. Give us a look next time. 
I've done that. Checking now it says i'm not registered with iMessage.I think the issue is that friends that had me as an imessage user have the same message threads and iOS is defaulting to imessage instead of SMS/MMS. I'm trying to get them to delete my contact and recreate it without any mention of iPhone and then deleting the messaging threads, creating a new one when all parties confirm deletion in groups.Should work, i'll follow up with results in case someone else runs into this.
Do you think Note 5 is still worth getting on AT&ampT? I'm thinking about switching from iPhone and I'm due an upgrade, but I've read so many horror stories about Samsung device performance deteriorating over time, or TW being laggy even with 4GB, etc. I'm wondering if you can still do enough without rooting to prevent the performance degradation. Any thoughts?
[At the moment, is seems Samsung is not currently allowing any new users, as downloads have been frozen, at least on our end.](http://www.droid-life.com/2015/10/19/samsung-pay-now-available-on-google-play/) 
Try that half a straw technique that was used to remove a backwards spen
You will have to take my word for it because I can't provide proof but I know Samsung is currently testing their Marshmallow build for the 2015 phones. I have no idea when its coming out though.
I also came from Nexus 4 and fought the phablet option as long as I could. I love the feel of the note 5 in hand.  Coming from nexus I thought Touchwiz would drive me nuts, but between launcher, theming and root I'm doing fine. If you 100% must have vanilla, go 6p. Otherwise I'd go with the note, especially at same price.
I use clock and weather widgets from Weatherzone (transparent and size customisable) and Upnext for calendar on Note5. Looks great
I personally have never used SD cards or swapped my battery on my Samsung phonesThat being said, I thoroughly am enjoying my note 5
Corners are generally what I want to protect. This case offers enough protection in that area for me. Two piece might be better if you are harder on phones.
I for real cannot find a way to change it.  This might be the one font you can't change on the phone. I'll keep looking though.
Same issue on note 5 (TMobile). It has been awful and really hope they do something. I also use Google voice and Hangouts is my default sms app. 
If you want a phone made by a decent manufacturer, go with the nexus. If you want a phone that will always get software updates as soon as possible get a nexus or HTC. If you're okay with getting a device that can be months behind on updates, even major ones, just to be able to use an s-pen then join the club and buy a note 5. Seriously, nobody should buy any samsung devices if they don't need a stylus. Unfortunately for me, I use the s-pen daily and no other phone has a Wacom digitizer. 
What exactly is Samsung Pay? How is it any different from Google Wallet?
How do you download new fonts? I honestly don't even know. 
You can get the firmwares at http://samfirmware.com and flash them with odin to upgrade your phone if you are not pleased with wait times.
No life at all. Cause nobody on the planet would buy a huge screened device with a stylus for something as silly as a job 
I use Relay Pro. As far as I've found, you can only post pictures with links, thats it.The screen might be a brightness issue? Has a lot to do with what your background is as well, static vs. dynamic, ect.
Before I installed Samsung Pay, I was getting much better Battery life than when I first got the phone, It took some dicking around but it was good.
Is that a serious answer? I haven't heard that in my life yet. Mandatory Suicide, South of Heaven and Raining Blood are fairly mainstream songs. Theyve done a ton of quality work.Samsung Pay support isn't out yet, confirmed for November though no exact date. Hopefully early. 
I have a similar length drive to school during which I listen to Spotify. It always uses about 4% battery. I know that doesn't really help you but just thought I'd share that because yours is discharging twice as fast it seems. I would check for apps that run in the background.
Although I'm getting my 32GB Note5 in a few days, I also came from the 32GB G2 and it only filled up once. I went on a trip and recorded a lot of 1080p 60fps videos and deleted them once they were on Google Photos. 
I kind of like it - it gives a 3D kind of feel to the screen.
A root method to change the font or a root method for the device?
Samsung Pay is worth keeping IMHO
Sorry for sounding technical but your phone will receive OTA updates like everyone else (and probably faster since it's not a carrier branded phone).Downloading and flashing firmware manually is more advanced and generally not required unless you need to restore your phone, which does not require root.
2 to 3 probably.  It'll degrade in performance over time and how fast that degradation is is up to your usage.
Search ET-PG920WCSAM1 instead on the Samsung website. They have a special version for the Samsung Pay offer. 
Evolutive labs is making a case for the note 5! You can pre order and it says it should be out any time now. Ordered a dark blue rhinoshield crashguard with screen protectors. A bit pricey at $45 but the case looks like it can take some serious damage. https://youtu.be/9DvhljsZY88
While not sticky per say, it is a bit more grippy than the stock glass back. 
Once reverted to the original firmware, it still works right?
The basic power saving or ultra?
Just the basic Power Saving Mode
Be sure to go to the Samsung app store, (linked in phone) and download Sketchbook Pro, Art Rage, and other free for Samsung user apps.  They are great drawing applications and help unleash the artist within you.
I'm on sprint and also haven't rooted yet because for now I'd like to preserve Samsung pay. Usually I've had the best luck finding toms for new devices by just going to xda and looking for the most popular thread with the most recently updated rom. In your case it would be this one here...http://forum.xda-developers.com/tmobile-galaxy-note5/development/boh6-tekxodus-n5-urv1-00-00-lollipop-5-t3201869
I guess I can make that work, but I feel like it's a cheap work-around. Might just end up sticking with the default keyboard. 
Can you store music on the s2? If so how much available memory do you have for transferring the music? 
Cost much?
Are your contacts backed up with your Google account? 
I'm on the Verizon model. And no tweaks at all! All I did was apply the Material dark theme. That day, I was on weak 3G or strong 4G for most of the day. Brightness is at 25%, I don't need it to be really high because I'm indoors almost all day. 
This is all what I personally use, as it works best for me. 2. Google Messenger is what I like. Good design, simple, and it works for me. 3. I use Nova Launcher Premium with an icon pack so I can make it look the way I want. Of course, you can always go with themes as well. 
Guessing this is KNOX coming I to play then?
See, I ordered my VR like 2 days ago and haven't gotten any email about it shipping. But I left town yesterday and my friend who is checking on my cats has told me I have a package from Samsung already at home. Super crazy. 
This sounds like fearmongering to me. The main difference with the newest Samsung chargers it that they support quick charging, which provides a higher current to charge compatible phones (like the Note 5).The stock charger is always the safest bet, however. Use your new stock Samsung charger or grab a reliable branded Quick Charge 2.charger (Anker, etc) if you want the fastest charging capabilities. Everything else will be slower, but should not damage your phone.More Quick Charge info can be found here:http://www.androidauthority.com/quick-charge-explained-563838/
Oh! Let me check the Samsung store then, thanksEdit: downloaded. Its nice for a simple program, but found a few deficiencies.Firstly there is no pen. The thing that looks like a pen still has pressure sensitive width. The brush settings aren't all that clear, I somehow ended up with a chisel brush pen and couldn't change it. Layer blending only has one global settings, blending needs to be adjusted per layer. Also there is no lock transparency or other advanced layer settings, or even transparency. The UI was alright, but no power user important features, like quick selectable dropper tool, quick brush size adjustment, or volume button undo. Also no canvas rotation.Edit2: found how to change the chisel setting by changing to presets. Also found a setting option to color sample with long press.Edit3: found there is per-layer blending and opacity! Very good, still no lock transparency though.
Sorry go to phone app then contacts then more at top right then settings, should be second option. 
You may have to do a full reset of the note (losing all of the data), unless you know someone with recovery tools.

That is so cool!! Seriously, I had been looking everywhere for something like this from the moment I got this phone. I'm curious though, what is a gloop pen -- I'm using it all the time and I love it but I can't figure out what it matches to in the real world. It makes me think of just letting watercolors bleed like crazy and it's fantastic :)Thank you for making such a great app!! :D
iPhone will probably last longer standby wise by a bit I would assume.  SOT will be similar but GN5 probably still loses due to 2k display vs 108and Android in general.  Some benchmarks say its a lot closer or equal battery life so I'd say mileage may vary depending on usage.
Smart Select through air command. 
Battery like crazy
My volume up and lock button do this. It's annoying but I use those buttons the nost. The only thing I've gotten to work is to wet my finger and slide it on the side of the phone quickly so it goes over the button. It fixed it for a while
I have the N920C on ATT(H2O) and I would say go for the ATT variant if you can. The 920C has no warranty in the US and the baseband is not the best match for US gsm networks. Also, I read somewhere(xda i think) that it is illegal to sell the N920C in the US market. 
My biggest gripe is the location of the CLOSE ALL button.  It's way too easy to accidentally tap the button.
Thing is, I can get the glass for like 2bucks. The glass *and* digitizer are like $200+. So, if I can easily separate the glass from the digitizer, I can buy a new golf club. I haven't bothered with insurance and exchanges since Balckberry days. 
I received mine from the promo that was active mid-Sept. Wireless charger works great, even through my case!
On mine it does it when I have a snapchat message or picture.

That's the glass back,  just with the film taken off 
Voice Service and Voice Wake Up
I had this issue too. I fixed it by setting WiFi off during sleep and disabling background data for Google Play Services only (not the entire phone). It hasn't been an issue since then and all my Google apps still sync just fine. Google Play Services won't wakelock the phone if it doesn't have network access.
Screen write after pulling the stylus out.
I'm on T-Mobile so the updates come in from Samsung, not the play store. I opened the app this morning and the update was available.
Just wanted to add that all contacts have their respective matching theme song for their stages. My wife doesn't have an icon yet :/ I can't seem to find a character that matches her yet
My new phone isn't offering that theme.  Is there a place to download it? 
Well my stance is accidents happen despite my best efforts.  It's almost like the logic of why wear a seat belt if I am a good driver. Not knocking people who go without cases but I would rather pay 16 bucks for peace of mind and resale value. 
Yeah it was 5.1.1 i figured it wasn't marshmallow but it would've been nice lol

Streaming from the internet or a device on the same wifi network? I can't believe the latter is going to cause issues.
Thank you, but that's not it either. The video highlights editor allows you to choose photos and videos in the device, organize them in the suggested highlights video, choose background music and other effects to apply over the video.This is something that I used once (before purchasing the phone) but I am unable to find it anymore. It theoretically comes with the default OS. I applied a few updates after getting the phone, not sure if that's the cause of the disappearance.
yup. works pretty well too.if you were wondering whether it was safe because it's not on the play store:https://blog.adguard.com/en/news/google-removes-adguard-android-app-google-play.html
Well, I have insurance on the phone, so I may opt for that
Rotox, it's like $1 in the Play store I think
I'm still waiting on an email. I've gotten nothing after my confirmation :(
I feel like you're one of those people who makes top-class art on Snapchat and such. This is awesome hahaha!
I see you've already used it, but some tips for the future, you might have to hold it up a little longer than you might need.  I've had a few where the terminal beeped so I thought it was good, then i pulled the phone away too soon. When using at an NFC terminal, it's no big deal, but when using at a non NFC terminal, everyone will think you're stupid for tying to use Apple Pay on their non NFC terminal. When it goes through, cashiers will be like WWWHHHHAAATTT!?!!?!?! There are still a few places you can't use it, gas stations and some POS devices built into computers. I know with gas stations they require a physical trigger, but I don't know about some POS devices. May have held it near the top when the reader was actually at the bottom... who knows. But it works on my vending machines at work so I like that. 
Oh okay. And hmmm that's weird. My Note 5 charger works great. But now that you mention thickness, I'm definitely gonna give my Note 4 charger a shot. Thanks!
I've signed up for all of them but haven't gotten anything yet other than my registration confirmations. I'm guessing you get some email notification when it gets approved? 
No they are photos I took with the camera they aren't sync to fb 
Dude... How? I just don't understand what else to do to the phone. There is absolutely no possible way I could get 6-7 hours. Yesterday was a long day for me on work emails away from the desk and I had 1.27 hours of screen on at the end of day with all other battery usage idling System Idle Cell Standby Android OS all at 1-3%. My Samsung email client was at 4%. I went 15 hours of basically standby with 1.27 hours of SOT and got home at 37%. 
Not much help here as I chose the 6p over the note 5.  But I was curious, how does themer affect things like S-Pen features? Are they native to touch wiz? 
Nope. N920C owner here and no lags. Even if there were lags, you could root it and fix it yourself as the international variants don't have warranty in the US anyways.
I didn't think I would ever use the spen in this thing but it's actually really good for browsing reddit. I don't think I can go back to regular Galaxy phones without a spen again. 
Nova launcher.  Do it now. 
On the Apps screen, tap S Note ??MORE ??More features??install extension pack.  It will enable convert handwriting to text function.
It doesn't have to be the Samsung charger. It can be any charger that supports quickcharge 2.0. My Anker charger makes fast charging kick in. 
This happened to my previous Note 2 as well. I haven't tried charging my phone while listening to music my Note 5 through the auxiliary as that's usually for long road trips. I'm no engineer, but I think the buzzing is just the nature of the beast while listening through the auxiliary jack and charging at the same time. 
Where did you get this update? Still on 2116 and play Store shows nothing. 
It's different, to say the least. Tough getting used to, because the interface doesn't respond to swipes and such like Wear does. This is all buttons based. Definitely seems a bit more responsive than the Wear interface. 
So would you be happy if he put up an ad that said: Clear Note 5 back. I scraped the film off it after carefully using heat and a suction cup to remove it. It took me about 30mins from start to finish and ill have to spend some time writing this ad and packaging it. $10(the back cost me $9.5and to make it worth it for me, I'm charging $90.5for my time, labour, packaging, internet use, computer depreciation, income tax, sales tax and cat food)??
Yep. Exactly. And you asked a yes/no question. Experience is irrelevant. Either there is an SD slot or there isn't. 
Don't have to pay out of pocket. Doing AT&ampT Next. I'm actually considering the Note 4 now due to the IR blaster (so handy), removable battery and SD slot.
Yep, but I believe you can add insurance for $8/mo with JOD too
Yeah. It's the only one I know of at the moment. It is recognized and says Fast Charging on the phone when in use though.
This may be a dumb question, but do the TouchWiz specific features like the S-Pen still work with this ROM? I'm currently on a Nexus 5 and I've been looking at the Note 5, but I can't stand the thought of going back to Stock TouchWiz after having a S3 back in the day. I like some of the features of TouchWiz, but the appearance and performance are terrible compared to Stock Android. If I could have a good custom ROM and keep those features though I'd be able to jump ship. 
Getting an item not found message from this link
I just jumped yesterday. I actually traded my G4 for this Note. So far, I love this thing. I notice the Ram issues when I have 5 or 6 apps open, but 99% of the time, I am on reddit or on Chrome so I never have issues.
I'm a big fan of being able to write quick notes on the screen without having to turn the screen on. 
I guess what I wrote was kind of confusing.  I meant to say that I wanted the icon gone but still keep NFC on.
Update on this - I just installed media Re.Scan. and so far it says updating 1/2598 and the progress bar is showing the ext SD card. When it finishes I'll let you know.Edit: IT WORKS media Re.Scan. worked flawlessly, all External SD files are now in my stock gallery!
My 32GB SD card was full. 
Does it have USB Type-C? I can't seem to find a confirmation or denial of it.
Thanks for the tip, I'll try and see if that will help me save any money from the carrier I select to go with (as opposed to going for contract).
Maybe, but i mean the product has only been out like a month so im sure more of these will show up if it is a issue with the screen its self across all devices.  But yeah ill go by there today and see about getting it replaced.  I still like the note5 so ide like to keep it.
Just updated as well. I thought samsung pay was to be in the update and not downloaded?
This. S notes can also be exported as pdf. 
Is it easy to change the back glass if it shatters?
No battery optimization it appears. Only Gear VR updates.http://www.att.com/esupport/article.jsp?sid=KB426900&ampcv=820
I did it a total of 3 separate times. One I got the wallet case, and the other two I did for the wireless chargers. So I got all 3.
Any one else receiving texts multiple times? I'm getting every text like 4 times a couple minutes apart from eachother. And it's happening to different contacts. Just updated. Did a soft reset. Don't want to reset the whole phone if I don't have to
Yea it made me finally start to use Swype. And it keeps smudges off the screen for the most part.
So do you have to use the pen to click anything?
Thanks for your post and answering.The close all box is actually quite large and extends to right above the side buttons.Anyway it's the kind of small annoying thing that only happens once in a while, but when it does boy is it annoying, would be such a simple fix too.Data toggle I only realized I was missing it when I traveled and needed to constantly toggle data on or off.Nothing else major I can think off, in fact I am so happy overall with the note5 I am dreading them fucking it up with mm, so it's good to read it doesn't seem to be the case -)
Themer is just a launcher that runs atop Samsung's vision of Android, which would be touchwiz.  Touchwiz is always there, watching you from the edges of your phone and waiting.
Yeah, I noticed the same battery thing but I also had lag so now I'm restoring after doing a full wipe.
As Shawn said, we have both Android and Samsung Pay. I would seriously recommend you use Samsung Pay. People think you're a wizard when you can use your phone with MST to pay on a non-NFC terminal. They also have awesome promos on samsung.com
Play store --&gt Settings --&gt Add Icon to Home Screen (untick it)
Only having enough space for one video file as I see it on my 32gb note 5 after OS will make cinema mode very tedious with needing to transfer all the time. I hope I am missing something. 
They send you a $10gift card or something for signing up now with samsung pay, instead of a $49 charger.
Yeah, this is one thing I always have issue with. I was getting pretty bad battery life out of my old phone and people kept telling me to turn off wifi, location, bluetooth, turn down the screen brightness to the lowest settings, set email to only sync when I open it, force close every app I ever open, etc. I'm just thinking, you know...I actually want to use my phone...
I typically go 15 hours from morning to evening charge, and in that time I would clock a 4.5 or 5 hour SOT before I hit 5%. I use Tasker to manage my radios. 
That's interesting. Maybe only some phones have the region locked. Not quite sure how this is all going to work out though. I checked online to see how much it would cost to purchase an unlock code and wasn't able to find anything for phones from Saudi Arabia. That was weird. I also sent a message to Samsung and they replied back with an email address. They said I should give them a few details about the phone and they will send me an unlock code. I just hope they are kind enough to actually send me an unlock code if I were to need one. Thanks for all the  info! 
Haven't tried anything else. I tried it with and without power saving mode.  Also tried with killing all the apps in background except Spotify, still unreliable 
The bloatware is fairly non-intrusive, so I just use a different launcher and there is hardly any TouchWiz stuff to worry about. The earphones are *okay*, I'm personally not a fan of the design they went with, as they keep falling out I just use a $12 Skullcandy pair instead. As for increasing performance speed, I don't think that will be something you'll ever have to worry about. Just restrict unnecessary apps from using data in the background.
Are you using a particular theme? Sorry, first time Samsung user noob here. My icons don't look like that (non-rooted, default theme).
Are you getting good battery life and performance? Any random reboots while on a call? 
On mine there is an option to disable the camera shutter sound within the camera settings 
I just flashed Dr. Ketan's ROM which comes with a toggle to switch between regular cable charging and fast charging. 
AFAIK, not on the default camera app, but you might be able to try out an app on the Play Store that allows for manual camera controls. I've heard many people use this: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.vipek.camera2 It's a paid app though, so I don't know if you want to try it out, but you could always refund within 15min if it doesn't suit you.The real question is whether or not the limit for 1second exposure is limited by the camera app, or by the camera hardware.
Eh losing samsung pay isn't that bad for me.  
Package Disabled Pro. You can use it to disable any app on a Samsung phone, even if it came preloaded.
Good question. I'd like to know this myself. I do, however, have somewhat of a solution. Use [Pocket](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ideashower.readitlater.pro) to store and read your articles at a later time (or right away if you wish). The benefit is that you avoid all annoying ads and formatting inconsistencies. Pocket also can read an article to you. I don't understand why people put up with the multitude of annoyances involved with trying to read an article on a mobile device using the mobile browser. 
Do not root it, unless you absolutely have to. It's not like Jailbreak, where you can just wipe iPhone and jailbreak is gone. Note 5 has an e-fuse which will be blown. You will lose KNOX and Samsung Pay functionality, plus potentially void your warranty. Plus, if you are not rooted, you are safer.  Do not download anything from outside of Google Play. Do not enable Apps from Unknown Sources at all. Even if installer tells you to. Only exception that I can think of is Adguard app, which is excellent at blocking ads. Disable Apps from Unknown Sources right away after installation.  Follow these steps, and you won't need antivirus.   Check out /r/android, /r/androidapps, /r/androidgaming. Tons of awesome things there.
They still haven't fulfilled the $5promotion they were doing, which I signed up for. However, I got a wireless charger from that promotion two weeks ago. I'm wondering if I'll even get both. Now they have a $10promotion I'm signing up for that too.More details: Our $10Gift to You??When you activate Samsung Pay and register a compatible card.Offer expires 11/30/2015.**Get $10off any Samsung.com purchase** when you activate Samsung Pay, register a compatible card &amp submit a valid online claim.$10coupon code redeemable only from 12/15/15 ??12/31/15*Exclusions Apply.*Check here for Samsung Pay compatibility information.
check for update, that's what i had to do to get it.
I'd wait for it to show up on eBay. Personally I'm not buying one until I see a review or preferably a video review for the battery case as I'm curious about the slot on the side. Is it for the battery? Can you charge the extra battery without going through the phone like so many other crappy battery cases?
Battery optimization works surprisingly well. How it works? I don't know ???. Update seems to fix the android system battery drain issue. Well, for me atleast. *edit*They seemed to have fixed the audio skipping and scratching on playback with certain formats
same problem. was working fine on sammy charger and a chotech.  with the otterbox defender.  then i dropped my phone.  no damage, but will not charge on the chotech unless i remove the outer skin of my defender case.  won't charge at all on the sammy charger unless it's nekked.  wonder if the charging receiver inside the phone are not secured good...
Don't think so, I have one app that has a setting if you're listening to music you can set it to vibrate only. It's sms app Yaata. I know it's irritating as hell especially when you get multiple notifications one after another. 
I've since deleted cache and data for stock camera app, restarted, and it hasn't done it since. It appeared it was only Samsungs camera app affected, I hope it doesn't return, I like the app.[That said it's a pretty interesting bug.](http://imgur.com/fUSSMOe)
1. Sadly I cannot help with this one I do not have a bank that works with it. 2. As for this one hold the back button that will pull up the menu in most apps.3. For this go to settings security fingerprint you can have up to 5 finger prints.4. Sadly for this one I cannot help you either because I have an AT&ampT variant. Hopefully I can at least help with two of your questions have a good one
2nd place after the 6p..thats still amazing considering he loves stock android.
Weird, can't pull up the menu on there Verizon variant?
Since you're eligible for USAA, switch over to Navy Federal. Their banking products are far superior as a credit union, and they'll test you very well. They're also on board with Samsung Pay.
It baffles me that someone decided this needed to exist. People who buy Notes don't think hmm now that I bought this 5.7 screen, I should cover up half of it. 
even if i fucked up on the fingerprint scanner it shouldnt matter. i should be able to long in with my samsung password or my google account but i am unable to do so. This Sounds like a softwear issue.
Thanks! This will be my 1st smart watch. I love how moto 36looks but the 2nd gen still has flat tire..
Also make sure your data is set to LTE/CDMA and not global. Also enable advanced calling. 
When you install an app, sometimes it says something like:(app name) will have access to the following content: contacts, camera, photos, locationI'm not currently an android user (although I plan on buying a note 5 tonight) but from what i gather, you will be able to restrict apps from gaining access to certain things on your phone
I know you said you don't care about system apps, but I really think package disabler pro is worthy of a mention. It does not require root, but you can disable a bunch of junk that Samsung and the carriers throw in. The app makes recommendations as to which apps are safe to disable, and if something breaks, just re-enable the app. By disabling these junk apps, your phone runs smoother, coolers and have longer battery life. 
I used handcent for a long time and loved the customization it allows, but stock messaging is the only way I've been able to have reliable group messaging that works properly, so I'm going to stick with the stock messaging app for a while.If handcent + att could figure out how to get group messages to work, I'd switch back in a heartbeat.
what's interesting is that the new S-pen is backwards compatible with older devices. But the old S-pen is not forward compatible with the Note 5.  So they must be doing *something* different.My reference point is the Galaxy note 10.1 (2014 edition).EDIT: Silly mistake here... of course it works fine. i had to pull the Note 5 SPen out first in order to be able to use the old Galaxy Note 10.1 S-Pen.
No, it doesn't align perfectly. But you can expect the following range of comments here if more than a few people respond:* Yes, it aligns perfectly!* It's pretty good, I'd never have noticed if you didn't say anything! Now it's probably going to bother me, damn you!* It's horrible and unacceptable on an $80phone! I actually returned my first Note 5 and exchanged it for a new one, but they both had this misaligned S-Pen problem. I guess that's just how they designed it. Careless!It's less than 1mm difference at it's worst and it's about 0.01mm at it's best (base of s-pen is roughly flat, but inserts to a curved portion of the phone body, so there are variable amounts of deviation)
I agree about the looks, but I have had a few glass screen protectors save me from drops before.
Thanks a lot! I'm going to purchase one of these since I could use a second one for at work.Unfortunately, after a bit more testing my device does not seem to want to charge wirelessly even with daydream turned on or when the device is powered off. I've arranged to have the device replaced by Geek Squad and if the replacement is no good then Best Buy stated they'll replace the device in store since i'm within 3days. Not bad service but I'm a bit peeved that there have been so many issues with this phone.
Razorblade wont scratch glassEDIT: for the dumb bitches that don't believe me. here's some science. I've been using razor blades to clean glass for years.http://imgur.com/SHhh88W
I have verizon but would gladly switch to ATT.  I have been searching for this all month (sept).  The main thing is I want an IR blaster, one of the rumors said it might come with one, as the regular note 5 does not.  If not I will probably just get the note 4.  But hold out its only a month away.
There isn't one. Vanilla Android (AOSP) and Exynos don't play well together. 
I had a card read error once, and that's because I was doing it wrong. If you put the back of the phone over the opening of the slot I've never had an issue with it. I was trying to put it on the outside of the plastic side of the slot, which I think was just too far away for it to get a good reading on it. But the only card samsung pay would work with was my credit card, and I don't really want to use it a ton so I haven't tested extensively. But of the probably 8 times I used it I had the one failure the very first time I tried it using a different method. 
My wife has the S6, and I have the note 5. Her phone does nothing more than the Note.  I have noticed that my battery is a bit better,  though that may be because I've done more tweaking to maximize it. The S Pen is pretty much the only difference,  besides screen size.  Both are phenomenal phones. 
on this new phone i mainly just check messages, emails, etc.  thats about it.  i havent had it nearly long enough to get into too much with it yet.  I just turn it on like every 10-3mins or so to check mail.  I had the screen set to i think 2 min on time, and i disabled the stay on when you are looking at it function.  I just cant imagine how 3 weeks of owning it under any conditions could burn the screen.  If just 3 weeks of screen use causes burn ins, then people would have to use thier phone a few seconds a day to get thier 18 months use time out of it without burning it. =|  It just doesnt make logical sense.  That said, i dont understand what is diffrent about the screen tech it uses, so i have no idea what its durability is like.
So far I'm loving it. The sides are rubbery but the back is a harder clear plastic. The fit is solid and it works with my screen protector. It also reduces a lot of the slipperiness of the phone, however there are more grippy cases than this one. 
It's not cheap and its not great on protection.  I've dropped my note 5 a few times without incurring even a scratch on the device itself but that's luck.  First time it slips out of your  hand and hits a hard surface you'll be praying the flap stays closed otherwise the screen is likely to get cracked. It's awesome in all other areas.
That kinda pisses me off because verizon made us wait for samsung pay, and now the promotion is over. Screw verizon
I know the feeling. I work in good ol rural America and have absolutely no signal when I'm working out of some offices I visit. But, they all have solid wifi so I can send texts and make calls with my GV number no problem. 
Probably the DiagMon app sending burst feedback to the server. Happens a lot. I think you can mute notifications sounds for that app in the App settings.
It doesn't help that Samsung is charging the banks for the honor of accepting Samsung Pay.
Wait the BEST battery life you have gotten so far is around 8 hours?  That is trash.
Honestly, it's very no-frills. It's coolest feature, to me, is the popup notifications that you can reply to instantly within the popup without switching apps.
Looks like you have Package Disabler installed. Go in and uncheck Smart Manager. 
To power saving mode? Ehhh. Depends. There's a school of thought that it causes more problems because if you run something at full speed and it takes 5 seconds, you expend less power than running at, say 60% for 8 seconds.Personally I only turn it on when my phone will be idling for long periods of time, like at work, mostly because I like having the buttons light up and haptic feedback.
Oh man.. I had the HTC thunderbolt on Verizon day one of its release... I'll never forget that monstrosity... It would get 4 hours battery standby... Lol
Are you on power saving mode? I know that prevents them from lighting up.
Maybe not the tablet s pen but the pen from a note 4 works on the note 5.
Totally agree. In the end,the lockscreen is probably my least favorite thing about TW. People think it isn't a big deal but it's the one screen you use every single time you pick up your device. It should be easy to use and allow you to streamline checking and dismissing notifications.  
I'm having the same issue... Non root+ fully updated.I also had this issue with my s6
You can master reset your Sync. I recently did on my 2015 Escape with MyFord Touch because the music was skipping. Fixed it right up. 
Dang, I'd much rather have those instead of a wireless charger that I got! Nice haul
Ooh, those Caseology Envoy Series cases look pretty snazzy. Do they add a lot of size to the device? It says form-fitting, slim and lightweight but that could be anything compared to an Otter Box. I'm currently on a Note 2, waiting for my Titanium Silver Note 5 to arrive some time this week. I want to have a good idea of a case or skin to go with once it arrives. 
Chrome, because bookmarks and stuff.
I have one on mine as well. Great case. Adds very little bulk to the phone, and best of all it doesn't cover up the beautiful design of the phone.Also it adds some much needed grip to a somewhat slippery phone.
I uploaded a screenshot for my SOT earlier today , I don't know if I can paste it here in a comment , however scroll down a bit till u find a post with the title incase you were wondering about the SOT on the note5 follow the steps i mentioned in the comments section. If that didn't work I think u need to get ur phone checked.
Look into gesture controls with the pen. I believe it has to be rooted though
Very useful app, even bought the PRO for the turnoff/turn on screen like LG's Knock-On/Off did have to switch to pattern. The turn on is a little finicky but I've gotten use to it making it quite functional. Will be monitoring the battery life as I could see a problem but for now its fine. Glad I found this app since I really hate the home button rofl. 
I'm using AT&ampT. I'll be honest, I've never had issues with any other device including Samsung ones on AT&ampT. Note 3 was flawless,  the 5 is perfect aesthetically, just battery is hit or miss (xda and Android central have threads on the matter).Android system has been an issue for some people such as myself, others have no issues. If your in market I'd probably give the nexus line or moto series a look, I was leaning heavy towards it and wish I waited (no bloat). Battery may be hit or miss but my experience with moto devices were overwhelmingly positive 
And I don't have damage protection either! I never dropped my G2 and hopefully I don't drop my note, at least for a year or 2
Good for you. Are you using Sketchbook Express? I draw daily with it as well. 
To be fair, Samsung has also been doing power buttons as long as anyone, and my power button is getting really soft after only 3 weeks. It gets better if I blow on it but gets soft again after a few clicks. After searching around, turns out quite a few people have the same issue 
I??m using Next Launcher 3d, Galaxy live wallpaper, and side controls without any lag. 
I like it. I typically just deal with the stock launcher and shit on my phones. Was bored yesterday and decided to mess with Nova launcher and custom Icons. Starting to like customizing my phone again. Do you have your Notification bar hidden? 
I'm on Sprint and getting similar results as of ~3 weeks ago. PDP, location off, all the stuff suggested in just about every thread. My phone makes it to the end of the day but SOT is nowhere near what it used to be, the battery drain is pretty bad, and Sys Idle/Cell Standby/OS are the top three items on battery usage but all under 5%
C'mon, that's a 1second Google search. 
Every phone exchange sucks these days. Normal procedure is usually remove the back remove everything else replace the screen
Which one did you buy, and do you have pictures of yours? 
Rooting will almost certainly disable Samsung Pay as well,so consider that before you do it. 
Yes it does! We have Android pay and Samsung pay. Unfortunately non of my credit cards or my credit union are supported by either service :(  
Because the note 4 has been out longer so they had more time to prep the upgrade or something.
Nah. My bank doesn't support Pay and I tried that Marshmallow leak which tripped KNOX, so I'm up shit's creek as far as that goes.
Hi Folks,I just upgraded to Note 5 on Verizon this weekend, and am seeing an issue.Whenever I get any email (to an account synced to the email app), I do have a notification listed on the top notification bar. However when I drag down the notification far, it doesnt show the contents of the email. Just the title, and then it says Content Hidden.I dont see this problem for other apps - Messages, whatsapp, etc show up all fine.I didnt have such an issue in Note 3. When the notification now pops up on my Moto 36watch, there as well it says Content Hidden.Appreciate help here.
damn it.. I was just about to complain why mine is has bad battery life compared to my previous phone (LG G2). Thanks for the info :) I hope samsung will release an update soon. Anyone has reported this to samsung?
They wear easily, and they are basically just big phone bubbles with no drop resistance 
Damn I don't think i qualify I have no amex, BoA, or citi cards. I did sign up for the beta though
Last time one of my phones dropped was 5 years ago and my friend dropped it.Also I have no insurance on it.
thanks again!when I'm finally masturbating to VR porn, my first VR orgasm will be for you. I'll pm you some pictures of the occasion.obviously kidding about the gross stuff, not kidding about being grateful.
I just went through the exact experience you had. I absolutely love every single thing about my note 5(T-Mobile) besides the battery life. It's just not possible to get a full day out of it with moderate use. I mean it's not like in streaming movies all day and have the screen on constantly. The phone just drains like a machine. I've had the nexus 6p and the battery life is AMAZING. I just miss my note because imo its the perfect phone excluding battery life. And if I can't use the damn thing because its dying and have to worry about carrying around a charger then what's the point. 
about 9 months ago I stopped using a protector on my s4 as it was just so annoying to get iut right month after month and dealong with bubbles. I am a hard user and work in a restaurant. My screen 9 months later still looks new on an s4. I'm pretty sure im just going to go with the flow on this one. The difference with protector on and off is pretty big with phones to me. 
I've owned all Notes from 2-5 and this is by far the best phone ever!  Period!  The Note 3 was awesome in it's time and the Note 4 was a little better...but this thing just take the whole mobile experience to another level!  I use Nova Prime but otherwise I'm stock unrooted on T_mobile GN5.  Great connectivity, awesome feel/build quality, best camera ever, good sound.  If you want to get picky I guess the memory management could be better, but it's not like it's slow when it has to reload an app.  I rarely game so it's almost a non issue for me.  Battery life is amazing after latest update a few weeks back that added doze feature.  I love my phone!!
The LG G watch.  I've only had this one, so I can't compare it to the others.  But, as a way to keep my phone unlocked (tethered to my watch), it is great.  I also use my watch to change or rate the music that's playing on Pandora or Spotify.  The battery is good on this watch.  I never have to worry about charging it before the day is up.
I bought one for both my wife and I and they both do the same thing.. Very frustrating.  I ended up just sticking with the original rectangle one and it works perfect every time, minus the quick charging.
Dunno if its related but since getting the update on Friday, my standby battery is much better.  I went from 2-2.7% per hour drain to 0.7-1%.
I have this same issue on the Verizon note 5. The only thing that resolved the connection issues during sleep for me was turning wireless completely off but that's not really a great option. I really hope this issue is addressed in marshmallow.
Aww I uninstalled galaxy app, what's the pack name so I can check play? Thanks
Does it work with wireless charger?
Depends on what you think you'll need your phone for. If you want the experience and polish of stock android, then go for the nexus. If you like the stylus of the note combined with the various features it gives (scroll capture is a personal favorite), then go for the note. 
Yep I definitely noticed it. Standby is much better. I'm sure it's related to the battery optimization settings that they added. It's sort of like an automatic Greenify for any app you haven't used in 3 days (unless you specifically add it to the exception list). This results in unused apps not running which improves battery and I assume frees up ram too. Definitely liking the update! 
Call Samsung, vsounds like hardware defect with USB port
Click on Screen and it'll tell you how much time the screen was on, aka Screen On Time (SOT)
I've used Bodyguardz tempered glass since August.  No halo.  In fact they had it and put it on in the store.  I am really happy with the white one.  Fingerprints don't show up as much if that's a thing for you.  I've been using a Versus case with a clear rubber back so it doesn't hide the phone at all.  
&gt Pixel FilterSince AMOLED screens consume power for lit pixels (vs LCD screens which consume power for back-lights no matter what the pixel state is) this may have some impact.Edit: Don't think you can run this while in Ultra Power Save mode though since it only runs a fixed set of apps.
Which network?
If you want to make like a private photo album you can create a txt file named .nomedia in a folder and gallery won't show any images in that folder.
Thanks for the help. When I made this it took me 2minutes to just edited because I was inebriated. This is what the app put out to begin with.

im using the Gear S2. Even though its not Android Wear, it does pretty much the same stuff for the most part. (I use to own a 1rst gen moto 360)The thing im waiting for, and reason i bought the Gear S2, is Samsung pay being activated on the watch.
If I tried this with my previous phones, it would have just been blackness.  This camera really is quite impressive.
The SM-N920I is the best but it has no CDMA radio. The unlocked SM-N920W8 might have a CDMA radio and has almost the same LTE bands.
Interesting. I've had it for less than a week now and well, my battery life is improving every day. Yesterday I used it heavily from 6AM to midnight, with 3.5h SOT and had 15% remaining. Will avoid recharging in the middle of the day and see what happens.
It appears the adhesive or whatever Samsung used to keep the dark grey part of the Spen attached to the lighter grey part isn't that great I've had the phone less than a month and now this happened. Doesn't seem like to hard of a fix just some really good glue re attach the pieces, the two pieces only separate when a click is applied 
In like a week. Video or Test? 
Is there any difference between this and going into the settings and force stopping and disabling the applications?
The reason Google Earth is sluggish is that it is pulling data about the 3d buildings from remote servers. You have to download all the models and textures on the fly. It's always going to be painfully slow.
There's an easy way to get it out if you accidentally put it in backwards using a plastic straw.It's also hard to put it in backwards, because the end is blocky. I'd equate putting the S-pen in backwards to somebody who pulls away from a gas station with the hose still in their car.That aside, I use mine extensively for drawing and taking notes, and working on low-res art for video games. Plus the split screen is great for multitasking.
I remember when the iphone 4 came out, it was easy to remove the back glass cover and buy replacements online with cool designs, some transparent too
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait...1) Pretty cool - thanks for sharing.2) So what sensor is enabled to do this and does this drain extra battery? Why isn't it absolutely killing my battery? If DT2W drains a lot (typically) why doesn't this seem to?
I have excellent battery life and I'm on Verizon. Even with the cell standby taking up a lot. 
MST (Magnetic Secure Transmission) is one of the two ways Samsung Pay can transmit a secure tokenized transaction. The other way being NFC. MST sends encrypted magnetic pulses and allows Samsung Pay to work securely at any payment terminal that has a card reader (which is everywhere in the U.S.), this is why Samsung Pay is the most accepted mobile payment here in the U.S. You can literally use Samsung Pay anywhere you can swipe a card. Today they just added the ability to use supported Gift Cards in the same way, by using Samsung Pay MST at any terminal that you can swipe a card.  
http://imgur.com/e1LhWrxNova Launcher with Retrorika icon pack and Zooper Widget.P.S. Does anyone know how to have a 7 day forecast in Zooper? I just get the cloud with he downward arrow thingy 
If it's not hiding on a home screen (it was for me) go to your widgets and find Galaxy Apps. It has gifts and essentials, which all have some really cool offerings. There's a Kindle one that gives you a free book every month. But yeah, it's there and free and awesome :-)
It's really worth it. It gave me an extra hour of screen on time after getting rid of everything but the s pen stuff and getting rid of everything Samsung software I could without breaking stuff like the guild pocket for recent items and the wallpaper chooser.
I've been using Lightning launcher for quite some time now. I'm not site the customization can be beat, but I'll give it a shot
Do you have the swipe down for notifications shade gesture on in Nova ? That accessibility permission seems to mess with the phone. Don't know why. 
Are you satisfied with the speaker on the note 5? No matter how I hold my phone either my pinky or index finger covers it, muffling the sound 
Yes, but the other two phones I had weren't able to achieve this speed. 
More or less yes, end result is that no app will drain more power than it actually needs, by limiting power usuage or cpu time of background processes.
Have you checked out the Nexus 5X?  With the new doze mode, battery life is pretty good on it.  It also isn't plagued by the poor memory management of the latest iteration of Touchwiz.
Yeah in the end I just decided to root my device last night. Battery has been superb!! Not too bothered about Samsung pay not working because its not even available in the UK yet. 
Asks for a pin or fingerprint first. I did that and it said it was ready but nothing happened when I put it over the reader. I'm thinking my unit might be defective.
I just moved from the s6 Edge to the Note 5 and I'm not looking back. The s6 is a nice phone, but the screen is a novelty that just doesn't seem to have a good use for it. I never used any of the intended screen features and I always had trouble texting. I love the big screen on the Note 5. My near sight is getting worse and the screen really helps me compensate for diminishing vision. I'm starting to think the s-pen is going to be like the s6e curved screen, but it 's nice to have and I stand a greater chance of finding more uses for it.BTW, the pen finder is really cool. The pen came out and I didn't know about it. I was on the other side of the apt and the phone started beeping at me. I'm glad it happened at home where it was easier to find...
The Rage on Fade street. It's full of old consoles and games, although they can be a bit pricey.
Anker PowerCore + 10050mAh. Great charger and fairly small in size considering it's mAh capacity.
Just got mine in the mail the other day. Works fantastic. Recognizes as wireless fast charger 
Alright sold!I use nova launcher, and use icon packs to keep things organized and clean. I am used to using Nexus devices so having any sort of bloatware is just really annoying to me!
Swipe down from the top to see if you get any notifications when you hear the sound again.
Battery cases have always been too expensive for the power they actually provide. You're not paying for a battery, you're paying for a battery shaped to fit around your phone. 
I have just read that on the eBay listing however I have just searched the model number of the note 5 and found this - http://pdadb.net/index.php?m=specs&ampid=8704&ampc=samsung_sm-n920w8_galaxy_note_5_lte-a_samsung_nobleIt has LTE band 2which means I will get 4G on my network o2 UKIf in turn i do not get 4G then I will be returning it. However i'm pretty confident that it will work. That website you provided said it will and my own research has shown it has the correct bands. 
None for my primary bank and it put some kind of untraceable security lockout on my credit card that neither Samsung nor BoA can figure out. My card just throws a contact issuer  error every time I try to use it
I want to know to. My phone has started to act very slow in texting as well as opening the camera.  I actually tried to take it back I have been getting so frustrated, but of course they couldn't find anything wrong.
I bought like 6 cases and none come close to the spigen slim armor.  Rugged and low profile, looks good, feels good and the grip is amazing... also works with wireless charging.  By far the best of the bunch.
Thanks for the advice - I don't have Samsung Pay installed on my phone at all by the looks of things.  I'm trying to play around with different sorts of things to see if it helps in some way.  I'm trying to avoid having to take it in to get fixed if possible!
[Mine](http://imgur.com/gOIt32o)  KLWP for the clock  Icons are from Flight lite
It's a cool idea, but it's just too unreliable and lagged to actually be cool.I disabled all of the always-listening options for Pay and just added a shortcut to my homescreen.
&gt  pickable apps will appear on a sidebar to tThat's the thing I don't get.  When I press and hold the back button, it acts like a menu button, or goes to my home screen editor (Wallpapers, Widgets Themes, Screen grid).  The diagonal also doesn't work for me.  I'm in my messaging app (The one pictured), and top left to bottom right/top right bottom left, fast, slow, finger, thumb, palm...none work.
If there's a snapchat subreddit, you should ask them. The front camera is a very high quality sensor. 
My best was 4.5 hours SOT. I seem to average around 3.5, but that is usually because I can't get more free time to stare at my phone. I have done literally zero battery optimizations of any kind. Also I am on tmobile
Google's keyboard also has this functionality
I got the update about an hour ago but still cant find the samsung pay app, checked play and samsung store, no luck even on the computer i cant find it... any help?
Do let me know. I got a great deal on this phone but nevertheless you shouldn't have to experience these problems on high end devices. 
Coming from a Note 3, I absolutely love it. I'd tinkered with the idea of going back to iOS (I'd had every iPhone from the original to the 4S), but then the Note 5 came out... I rarely use(d) SD cards and had never swapped batteries, so neither of those missing bugged me. Battery life for me has been stellar, no memory management issues for me. I'd been toying with going back to iOS for a more consistent UI, but the combination of TouchWiz's Lollipop and a good theme (Material, at the moment) has made me glad I decided not to switch back.
Hmmmm and this saves enough battery to not have that function on?
I doubt it. Wireless charging is usually done via two coils.

Dang.  I tried looking at their black Friday ad but it says that phone deals will be released on Thanksgiving day.     If they don't do it again for Black Friday I might as well do the $5upgrade from best buy right now 
That was it. S cloud backup. Thank you. 
Well yeah. I don't understand the people who say just turn off the wifi. I just paid 600+ for this thing and I am not going to turn of its native functions just to have decent battery life. The bug is still there and yes it is related to the wifi and router setting somehow although, I haven't found which settings affect it. Still waiting for the update. Also, if you can, go to samsung's support website and on the top right corner click on feedback and send them a note regarding the issue. No other way to fix this. 
I'm pretty sure screen off detection can't be setup without root/ROM.Trusted Voice only works when the screen is on but device is still locked (on the lockscreen).Any screen detection works on any screen when the device is unlocked.
I think that you can have an s-note widget and just connect that to the action memos section, but I think almost any interaction with the home screen requires an app.
What's more annoying is that they won't even let you use a 4 digit pin, it has to be alphanumeric.
thanks for answering. Too bad, I don't want to use an extra adapter, and I don't know if I can get a Note 5 charger here. I'll look up some Anker equivalents.
I had the Note 2 for almost two years before switching to the Moto X (2014). It was a decent phone but I ended up hating Motorola by the end of it all. The Note 5 is the best smartphone I've ever had.
What I don't see is the difference between Samsung Pay and Android Pay, except that Android Pay allows you to use any card from any bank. 
The fastest I've gotten on my Google fiber was ~25Mbps up and down. However, I was using an AC120router. I think if you used a better router (an AC190one like Google onhub) then you could reach full speed.
When I come home from work I usually have 30-60% left depending on how productive I was that day.When I get home I throw it on the turbo charger, eat dinner and then take it off the charger with 100%.
How do you view long screenshots?
I like being able to get into my phone without my fingerprint when I'm home or in the car, but each to their own.
I can't speak from experience but things that annoy you about the note will be the same for the s6 (like the spotify thing). Both phones are touch wiz/android . Have you checked your settings for Spotify?&gtdoesn't fit in my pockets well (I'm a 5'7 male).  You're not wearing skinny jeans by chance are you?  )
Nope. As fas as I know the international Note 5s don't come region locked. I have mine from UAE in the US and no region lock. 
Does anyone know which charger is includes in the level on bundle? 
I got 2+ days with 2.5+hrs screen time without going under 30% battery.
I don't love flashing and all. I can flash 1 time on something good, but prefer not to. I just need good hardware with good software. Note 5 totally have better hardware, but I am really afraid of Touchwiz and lags and freezes I read about S6 reviews after two month.I really know everything about this two phones. But opinions on Touchwiz performance are totally opposite from man to man. 
Note 5 with a top tier case, since I'm fairly clumsy and outdoors a lot. Think I'm going to hold out till black Friday before I give up on the active though.
Can I ask how much battery time you're getting when around 98 percent because mine says 9 hours and idk if it's a defect since my friends note says 13 hours 
I just purchased a Note 5 for Verizon last night at Best Buy. The receipts I received while doing it were just for the verizon plan and I didn't have anything specific to the phone itself to sign/date and screenshot to submit for the promo. Would using that receipt work? Or is there something else I should be using instead? I just want to make sure that the promo request works. Thanks!
Just get the Tmobile variant if you can, N920T. You may have to pay to get it sim unlocked if you don't want to root. Tmo will require the phone to be registered on the network at least once (prepay?) usually before sending an unlock code.There is a free method if you choose to root. But you will lose Samsung pay if that interests you.
This happens in every app, including the home screen. In addition, the bug occurs with the capacative buttons in any app.
HD Glass
I downloaded the app and set the subreddits I wanted it to pull from with a 6minute refresh. There wasn't too big of a battery impact since I have it set to only sync when on Wi-Fi. 
Google's Messenger app is my favorite so far
You can't do it for wifi. 
Awesome! Thanks for helping me get more informed. If I may trouble you a little farther would you be kind enough to offer a comparison between the differences and potential difficulties of rooting vs jailbreaking? I'm not asking for detailed instructions or anything I'm just curious if rooting is as simple as downloading a program, hooking into a pc, and clicking a few buttons or should I be prepared to get a little more in depth? My tech skills are laughable at best to anyone who actually possesses any and I don't want to get in over my head because of lack of preparation. 
Cell Standby is my biggest drain, but I don't have the option to turn off Voice over LTE on my device. I'm using Verizon and the guide is on TMobile. Does anyone know how to accomplish this with a Verizon Note 5?
Would you mind posting a pic of the damage? How tall was the drop?
Yes,very easy to export which apps you have disabled and than import the settings back in. Do you have any type of metal in your case? Like for a Magnet car mount or something like that?
Is it better to have animations off or .5?
Have you ever had any kind of resolution to this? I notice the exact same issue, I wasn't able to pin it down on VBR mp3 files though. I noticed it's only with files I download off my Subsonic server with dSub... Which all happen to be Vmp3s. It never happens on Spotify or Pocketcasts though.Same exact issue though with the 'glitching' never taking place at the same spot, sometimes left channel, sometimes right. It's absolutely infuriating considering 75% of what I listen to are live concerts downloaded off of my Subsonic.  I haven't tried using Poweramp to listen, but the issue persists in both dSub and Shuttle. Not sure how a different player would handle it better.
Nice album. Where these taken in raw mode and touched or straight up to jpeg?Edit: Why are some of the geotags pointing to Malaysia/Singapore. Is the geotagging incorrect ?
Well that's disappointing. I wanted to keep stock touchwiz
If you purchased it,  not on the Next Plan you should put it up on Swappa. Then get. Your money from PayPal,  make the purchase on ebay(been some good deals lately. 
Knox did not trip when I flashed stock firmware through odin, sadly my wifi speed did not change.. oh well
No one could hear me on my new Note 5 either.   I had to send it to Samsung under warranty. They replaced the mic.  Hopefully I get it back in the next few days. 
This screenshot was taken using DiskUsage. And I'm using ES File Explorer right now. 
Still waiting on my email. I only submitted like two weeks ago.
Can't be rooted or can't be rooted without tripping knox? Because I doubt it can't be rooted at all. 
Icon and wallpaper link? Love this. 
Me too. I believe it's the headphones. Wireless charger and the battery pack
They're both great phones, and you're not really going to go wrong with either. I went with the Note 5.The 6P has stock Android and is a bit cheaper, the Note 5 has TouchWiz, a stylus, and apparently a better camera. 6P comes with up to 128gb of memory, so if you don't have a laptop or tablet, it might be better more storing lots of movies.Most of the differences come down to taste: 6P has USB-C so it'll be compatible with future devices, Note 5 has USB-B so it works with all your existing cables. 6P puts the fingerprint scanner on the rear, which is more convenient when holding it, Note 5 puts on it on the front which is more convenient for checking notifications when it's on a table.Wireless charging is a pretty huge win for the Note 5 in my books though - that swayed my decision more than anything else. It's just so convenient.
Do you need to add a card to get the charger or just activate the app?
Exynos processor.. Samsung doesn't share any of its sources about it. So making AOSP for note 5 is like travelling without a map. It will require huge effort and dedication by developers.Unlike qualcomm which its sources available to people, which makes it 100x easier to make AOSP ROM for.
I just realized the correct translation would be Regulatory Is there an option for that in the About phone?
This update is N920TUVU2COJ5/N920TTMB2COJ5/N920TUVU2COJ5. The T after the N92symbolizes the carrier. In this case, the update is specifically for T-Mobile.
This is a common problem, change the USB cable. 
I  can't seem to find this at all I am not finding the optimizing option anywhere under battery under any app
To be fair an iPhone 6 is a 4.7 inch 720p phone vs this 5.5 2k phone.  Have you disabled anything / are you running on power saving?
Samsung pay works perfectly fine. I do not have a wireless charger yet. Waiting for it to arrive from the promo so I can't comment on that.
I've had the Nexus 6, Galaxy S5, iPhone 6 Plus, LG G4, and the Galaxy S6 Edge. My Note 5 is the best device I've ever owned...by a very long shot. I go through phones like crazy, but I can see myself with this one until the Note 6 comes out.

5 hours including games.  Pretty heavy user.  Very happy with the battery
Apex. It's pretty much the same as Nova except for in Apex I can make my dock icons a lot smaller than I can in Nova. I like to keep my desktop clear of all icons except for a widget. With a really small scaled down dock with 6 icons on it and the dock itself scrolls right and left. If you scroll to the right the dock has all my folders in it. 
Yeah, I'd ask your carrier for a replacement due to a defective screen.  That shouldn't be happening.
So the wallet case will fit 2 cards?
I try software update every few days. I live for disappointment.
Silly question but are you able to install themes from the Samsung theme store with Nova Launcher? I don't hate TouchWiz but there are a few things I'd like tweek by installing Nova Launcher.
The battery life on the Note 5 is much better than the S6. If you are really worried about the S Pen damaging the phone then you can get the Note 4 however it won't have the same look and feel as the S6 and the Note 5.
The point is you are making a lot of assumptions like this consumes folks lives to sit around and push SoT to the limits. Something as simple as netflix or local video on loop makes this easy. You'll also note I stated my use case means I am not one of these lifeless ones but what is your gauge for your assumption? You're in a Note 5 sub, for a phone that is popular for some very specific things, to include battery life.  So it's not surprising that tons of posts are about spens and battery life.  
Ask yourself how often you're going to use the S pen, with the note 3 and 4 I didn't use it that much maybe twice a month, but still it was nice to have it there when I needed it. With the note 5 I use it  a bit more. The phone for me does not lag, if you are worried about the battery get yourself an external battery or get chargers for work, your car and anywhere else you stay so you don't have to worry about it. 
drop it to the ground and tell it is shatter proof!
yes and no, most glass has a layer of something else on it that will scratch. but if its just plain glass, then no... metal wont scratch it
So far it has worked 100% for me:Taco Bell - swipe reader on the cashier register's screenMcDonald's - I did it on the swipe reader and not on the NFC portion to test the MSTSafeway - Swipe reader (same reader where you slide your Safeway loyalty card as well)Philz Coffee - Square terminal, the type where it is an all-in-one with a screen that flips around facing you and a swipe reader that you slide from left to right (like this one https://squareup.com/POS )Little Caesar's Pizza - Verifone swiper that also prints out credit card receipts.Worked 100% of the time for me, and getting those amazed looks from all the cashiers.  Even had one cashier (from Little Caesar's) asked if she could also do that on her iPhone and I chuckled while I stated that only Samsung phones can do it.
Maybe a wallet case inside a pelican box? 
A very small border around the protector that decided not to adhere right. It almost looks like a bubble would, just all around the edge
I've got all the tools needed, just wasn't sure if I should order some double sided tape before hand in case the glass doesn't have enough left over adhesive to stick back down. 
How the fuck do you get that kind of speed on the network? I'm on AT&ampT and I only get like 20.
Came from a Note 4, it was a very noticeable upgrade even though it's only one up in the series. The speed is the biggest factor, everything about the device is faster. Double pressing the home button to launch the camera the bee's knees and the photo quality is excellent. I don't often say this because I am usually very critical of android but I love this device.  
Ever find a fix? I am getting the same message 
The amount of settings you can actually mess with is extremely disappointing though. Under display settings there's about two thirds of a page of options. On my old S4 there was more about 2 pages and secondary options underneath a long press for most the options. Settings are definitely dumbed down from previous Galaxy phones.One example is the touch buttons on either side of the home button. On my S4 there was a setting to disable the backlight for those buttons, on my Note 5 that setting is missing and I had to download a third party app called [Galaxy Button Lights](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.notquiteinsane.galaxybuttonlights&amphl=en) to do it.A recent update to the Samsung Smart Manager is also annoying as all hell. They added app optimization for saving battery life. You can set it to always optimize apps or optimize after a set number of days (3, 5, or 7 days) of inactivity. It warns that optimization can block notifications in some apps, seeing as some apps I might not use within a week but want notifications for I set those to not optimize. But now I get a notification from Smart Manager every other day telling me that not all my apps are optimized, which I already know and I can't block the notification. If I turn optimization off entirely I still get the notification every other day. The only way to get the notification to stop is to optimize *all* my apps, even though it gives me the option to pick and choose which apps to optimize.Really, the only good thing about this phone is the big screen. I'm not subbed here to praise this phone at all, I'm just stuck with it and I might as well browse here for tips to try to make it less retarded.I should have waited for the Nexus 6p.
AMOLED only saves battery on true black not dark colors (though it can help slightly I'd imagine).  As for night drain, its sync that takes up battery - Marshmallow will help this a ton but for now, 1% a hour isn't bad and there are a few sync shut off you can do (tasker can help).How much did you disable?  Did you reboot into bootloader and clear cache after disables?  Do you have any apps in your battery menu that are high on the list in the morning?  
I opted for a cheap $1spigen case and it has actually saved my phone on 3 occasions now. If you like a skinny case I'd go for that, if not just get a bulky case like an otterbox. I would also highly suggest a screen protector. I have a tempered pane protector,  cost about $1on amazon. Already chipped the edge dropping my phone on gravel, but it probably saved the actual screen from cracking. If you want wireless charging definitely pick one up, the standard quick charger that comes with it works pretty damn good though.
Still not available for international users (SM-N920C and other variants)
Only email I've gotten is telling me my imei number is invalid.  I filled out the appeal form, got confirmation they received the appeal, then nothing.
I'm glad that I'm not the only one... This annoys me beyond belief. Every other day at a random time it'll kick out a notification about this nonsense. Enabling, disabling, and even messing with the settings of the optimization app don't do anything to stop it. You also can't block notifications for that particular app. Who at Samsung thought this was a good idea? It has to be a bug. I'm trying to hold off on rooting this phone. 
Can't make it with the stock file manager. I'd suggest ES file explorer.
Haha. Eat with my left and use stylus with my right while phone is on table. I try. 
Bodyguardz hands down. It's tempered glass so it's designed to withstand the impact, plus lifetime replacements for just cost of shipping. I don't even notice it's on 99% of the time. Make sure to get the Bodyguardz pure. The UltraTough clear is a plastic film. The pure is the tempered glass.I literally had a SCREWDRIVER taken to my Bodyguardz before. Screen protector was shattered. Manager told me my phone was done for. I peeled the screen protector off... there wasn't even a scratch on my actual phone screen. If you buy it online, I would strongly encourage you to let someone at your local cell phone store install it for you. If not done right, you'll get a lot of bubbles and dust underneath the screen and it'll make your Note 5 look trashy. 
You don't. I have all sounds and vibrations off, actually. I have a Pebble for important notifications and I generally know when I've pressed a button on my phone :) 
If I just sit on my phone for a whole day I can get over 5 hours SOT, but it seems to be the screen off stuff that hurts me.
Mine is literally 3 days old and my spen smells funny too
This is actually a very good idea. I should make some type of live wallpaper that displays real time Gas price on a gas station!
Not sure. I can't try since Samsung Pay isn't available in Canada.
I would play it safe and use a screen protector just in case. 
Try turning off power saving and plugging directly into the wall. Worked for me. 
The only things the S6 Active doesn't have is the attractive glass/metal design, the fingerprint reader, and additional storage options.The S6 Active added an Activity button, water resistance, and a much larger battery. Otherwise the screen, resolution, CPU, RAM, and everything else is exactly the same as the original S6.
What font pack was that in?
I've got both. I find battery to be better on my 6P.
What widgets, specifically? 
Yes, I knew Swappa would cost the same. Seems like there's benefits to unlocked/international variants. Plus then my AT&ampT contract won't renew. 
Had this problem with an unlocked note 4 from att. Had to borrow my buddies att Sim that was activated in order to get the update. It's just another way the carriers make it a pain to leave. 
But I don't want to see that screen at all, I just want to see my normal homescreen.I'm used to pressing that hardware button to wake everything up. It's frustrating.
That first drop on concrete will change your mind. I was careless for about a month. The phone feels amazing. I just can't do no case. Not worth rebuying the phone if it breaks. I use to have the defender otterbox, didn't like the big rubber brick, i instead got a rhinoshield number case. Still feels amazing whole offering otterbox protection. 
It really has all the features you want. That's what you're really paying for. You don't compromise on anything besides TouchWiz. That's it... It even has fast WIRELESS charging for Pete's sake.
I'm pretty sure you have that backwards. The question is Turn off pen detection?On = Yes, Off = NoOn saves battery by turning off SPen detection when the pen is attached. Off keeps SPen detection on all the time (wastes battery).
I got an update as well, it's 140.52mb though. Not Marshmallow, sadly :(EDIT: For TMo, it's an update that adds Android @ Work and a few other fixes...

I'd also recommend the Crash Guard bumper as a good relatively low-profile case for drop protection. Just keep in mind that the Note's contours are so comfortable and slimming in hand that even a bumper will feel excessively bulky.
Android doesn't have that ability anymore. You can use Android File Transfer via usb, but you won't see your phone as a volume. 
Clear data on those apps and/or use Package Disabler Pro - won't cure but it'll help.
its the samsung charger I guarantee it
The Choetech fast wireless chargers dim the light in a dark room. Got mine for $24 or so on Amazon. It's not free, but its way cheaper than the actual retail price of the Samsung one.
My buddy got his charger the other day with no shipping information.. It just arrived. Then that night he got a tracking number for a later date. Guessing he'll get two, maybe three. 
The new firmware update allows you to change this on an app by app basis via the battery section in the settings I belive. It's only been pushed out to tmobile and Sprint so far. I'll try and see if I can find the original post explaining how to do this. It was about spotify closing out. 
Are you talking about the $10for the Samsung store for signing up for Samsung pay? If so, even once we get the codes, we're gonna have to wait. The terms say $10coupon code redeemable only from 12/15/15 - 12/31/15.
Can you post a picture of the back of the phone with this case on?
Dude I was pissed when that update came around. There was global outrage. Powertoggles helped but was no where near as fast as the original ones. Fucking atandt probably did it to make people use more data accidentally. Greedy fucks. Atleast they aren't CDMA and require their brand of phone to work. Root is life.
I just got a sample in from Choetech, so I put up a review for everyone.  This is one hell of a charger, I just wish I had more time to review it.
Yeah it sucks, luckily for me it's on roku so I can stream on my tv, still sucks for mobile
No, but you won't be able to use Android Pay or Samsung Pay. 
I got the magma red one. Looks amazing on the sapphire black.
The additional 100$ is defo worth the extra 32 GB. Get the 64 GB version because then you can actually enjoy the phone by watching shows and movies and such on the go : )
I much prefer Google play music over spotify. The 50k songs you can upload of your own music for free is amazing. And you can get all access for the same amount as Spotify? I'm a customer for life. 
So I bought the Verus High Shield Pro for my mom's Edge Plus, and the case feels sooooo much better than the Spigen Neo Hybrid, and I prefer the brushed metal look and feel over the carbon fiber, but that's just my opinion. Also the Verus case doesn't add as much bulk to it, but that's a good and a bad thing.
Did you use some kind of spray to clean the screen ever? 
Was your wifi on phone around half of it what supposed to be or it was just randomly disconnecting?
[Here is Mine, its pretty standard](http://i.imgur.com/KrGq1KM.jpg)  Note though, this setup i have caused screen burn after 2 weeks, going to replace phone today.I see you guys mention this Nova Launcher, what does it do diffrently or better?  I had GO Launcher on my old android for like 3 years, but is this Nova Launcher something better or new or what?  I guess what are the main pros and cons of using it?
Yeah so far it's mostly camera and 4K demos haha. Thanks for the suggestions! 
I used google photos on my iPhone too before I went to android. Made it nice to still have access to the last few years of photos I've taken. 
I used it for the first time yesterday. It was NFC and worked instantly. Def love that shocked response from the cashier. Here's a look at [the tech behind Samsung Pay](http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/09/samsung-pay-launches-in-the-us-today-can-it-challenge-apple-and-android/). The NFC looks to work with newer readers, but there's other tech at work for old magnetic readers that I'd never heard about before. Called Magnetic Secure Transmission, MST lets you use the service on all old card readers by sending out a magnetic signal. Sounds clever but the timing couldn't be worse with the forced shift to chip&ampsign or chip&amppin, depending on where you live.
A little boring but I use Evernote for walk of this.  S note syncs to it.
The S-Pen definitely has a hold on me moreso than Samsung Pay. Samsung Pay is great, but I still like to have a backup CC in case there are issues paying. I couldnt' get it to work at a convenience store the other day and had to run out to the car. I use the S-Pen a ton, for notes, marking up editing screen captures and just scrolling through Twitter.A friend dropped the phone, and it has a crack on the bottom over the 'back' button and partially on the screen. Tried out an iPhone 6 to see if I'd want to just switch since i've had the idea in the back of my head, and couldn't do it. I like the Note far too much. I'll deal with the crack. Samsung wants $237 to repair it, a bit steep when it's barely on the screen...
They're the standard chargers. It seems Samsung isn't ready to give out the fast chargers for free just yet.
&gt Not sure if it takes up storage, but if it did it would be a waste.Do you mean the debloater tool? It's actually a computer program you run, not an app that takes up storage :)
Not sure if it's imgur or that I'm not on the note 5, but these pictures look far from impressive. I'm guessing it's the former.
Ok firstly I want you to forget the specs and think about this.Do I want a curved screen or just a regular display?After you've made the choice consider this:The S6 edge plus is basically a better version of the regular edge with a bigger battery and 1 more GB of RAM. The edge plus as you know has a much bigger display so consider that. The specs of both aren't that different so I wouldn't be to worried about performance. So do you want a bigger battery and more ram and a bigger display or is that something you don't care about or rather have a smaller screen? Keep in mind that both devices feature quick charge so that may help you make your choice on if you really need a bigger battery? You may want to go with the regular s6 and charge it more frequently or if you hate bad battery life you may want to stick with the edge plus.Now with the note 5 or S6 I slowly recommend the note 5 it beats the S6 battery (though consider quick charge) had a bigger display if that something you like and has an S pen if you like that ad well. The note 5 also has more ram and a bigger battery but it's up to you if that matters.Yes you will get a manufacturing warranty and maybe your carrier will give you something to ask them. Keep in mind that your manufacturer warranty may have limitations about what they will cover for you. About your phone getting stolen I don't believe your warranty can help you with that but I might be wrong double check.Before you buy these phones consider if you want a edge screen and if you want bigger batteries and more ram. Keep in mind that the note 5 and edge plus are very similar devices except for the fact that the note 5 has a S pen and the edge plus had a curved screen. Same thing will the regular s6 and S6 edge.I hope this helps you make a choice. But sure to respond eventually what phone you decided to pick up and good luck with your choice!
I had location issues like this with my S4, but not my Note5. 
Google Music is the dopeness.
If you have any auto backups, Such as Google Photos or Dropbox, check those and make sure they aren't doing something wonky. Looks like your media server is causing a bunch of drain.
dunk in a bucket of water for an hour, drop it to the floor from standing height and take it completely apart for no good reason.  At least that's what I've seen yahoos on the internet do with theirs.  me, I just took mine out of its box and used it - and was careful with it.  I got a case and screen protector too - I like this phone and I want to keep it for a while.
This is going to be heaps of work but roms like Ditto and Dr Ketans Rom has call recording features.. I'd use that to call up voice mail and just listen to them all.. DoneThese roms might not work for your device.. Depends on which model you have 
I use Auto Wallpaper (for reddit). It pulls the top pictures from whichever sub you choose and sets it add your background. It will even refresh every hour or so. I love looking at my phone now just to see what it pulls up. I think I just did r/earthporn and r/spaceporn and I've seen some beautiful images.
My wallpaper isn't black,  I just use muzei so it changes every hour.  The Samsung theme I'm using however uses a lot of black and gray. 
I own a Nexus 4 and it has some chunks missing in the metal casing and a cracked glass back from a recent drop.My new Note is staying securely in it's chunky Otterbox case for now.... :)
I also disabled Facebook, messenger, Instagram and most of the other pre installed apps on the first day I bought it
Don't you only sync when you turn on the screen and connected to wifi? If I only use data and no wifi, will google ever sync this way?
I would make sure you have the right bands available for where you live. There are many note 5 variants.
Tried that. It pulsates, shows the screen that instructs you to pass it over the reader but it does not do anything. Tried it again today at a grocery store and got another dumb look by the cashier lol. 
Also came from an S5 Active... iPhone 5 before that.  While I was happy with the Active, this is the best phone I've ever seen.  I get 5-6 hrs SOT without package disabler.  I just disable the bloat in application manager.
It would be a logistical nightmare, ONE company claims to have a curved glass protector from what I've seen, which is www.iloome.com and they'e completely sold out of every model for every phone.  Sounds like they went bust or their product line failed to live up to expectations.Also, keep in mind a curved protector will make putting a case on this phone a fucking nightmare as well.
Check out the Spigen Hybrid case. Bumper with a clear back. I've been using them on a ton of phone lately.
It's so upsetting that my bank doesn't support Samsung Pay so I missed out on this promo. 
The kickstand is flimsy and doesn't help with holding. Aside from that, it's a great case! 
Definitely a design flaw! Googling the issue brings up some dust issues and some solutions involving tapping the button with slightly water wet sponge among others. Have you tried any of those things? 
I got the update on Monday but yes this is the new App Optimization feature.
I didn't think the Note 5 will use quick charge from 3rd party chargers? I've got 2 QC chargers, but they don't charge my 5 nearly as quickly as they did my note 3.
Also to let you know any Wacom stylus will work with the note 5. I have a Wacom stylus from 2001 Compaq tc110and it works alright.  
Just get a good quick charge 2.battery. I have the Aukey 10400mAh battery and it seems to charge if as fast as the adaptive fast charger that came with the phone.
Personally i use nova free, payed has much more to give, also i heard many great things about lightning launcher.
Well, to be fair, it's a curved piece of glass on the Note.  Covering anything curved with a flat piece of glass is going to be an issue.  
I'm using the international model. Other than some Samsung apps that isn't any good and doesn't do anything, the phone is alright. This is by far the only version of TouchWiz without as much hate as the previous versions. Keep the bloat down Samsung! 
I agree with none. All the phones I owned and none had screen protectors on them. All this gorilla glass advertising with new phones is one reason why I don't use them. A simple switching of keys to my left pocket with my wallet removed that equation.
I have the Rhinoshield bumper by Evolutive labs that was on Kickstarter a while back. Since it only covers the edges of the phone, I put a tempered glass screen protector on as well.
I never had much of an issue w/ my Note 4, but lately it's starting to get on my nerves, plus seeing more Note 5s in action and their smoothness...Is it as night-and-day as some of these speed tests demonstrate?
This is going to be unpopular in this sub but I'd get the Note 4 if I were in the market. Replaceable battery, microsd, and IR blaster are all things I extensively use and make this a more future proof phone vs the Note 5. It must be cheaper too.
It's a way to increase the sensitivity of the display so it recognizes touch even from thick gloves. It's especially useful in the winter in northern countries. The mode was present of the Galaxy S4, Note 3, S5 and Note 4, but apparently Samsung removed it from the S6 and Note 5 for... reasons.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swLpNH9F9CE
Are you asking about the System Memory Entry? Because that's the OS. Not going anywhere. 
Haha, no I'm not nearly fit or hip enough. When I say it doesn't fit, I mean like it sticks out of pockets, i.e. my back jeans pockets and my scrub pockets. The only thing I see in spotify settings that looks like a possibility is something about allowing other apps to see what you're playing, which I have turned on and I'll see if that fixes it.
That XML list actually turns off a whole bunch of useful items:- The Email client on the phone- Android Webview, the tool that allows your phone to show sites in-app.- Functionality for ANT+ connection, designed for sensors in lots of different accessories.- The pull-down assistant menu for options.That's just a few from a quick look at the XML list.  It'd be nice if someone could compile a list of what all the supposed bloat does.  Many of these things don't even turn on except under very specific circumstances!
Yes I do understand that. I'm not looking for a way to take notes in general, I am familiar with that process :)  I'm specifically looking to pin a note to the home screen and be able to write on that, and see what's written on it, without going in and out of an app. 
You've a virus or your phone? ) just reset man 
I figured it out,  I had to go into data usage&gtgmail&gtapp settings&gtclick on email address and then check the box that says sync Gmail.   This enabled syncing for all Google Apps.   Now I could go back to accounts and the sync toggles appeared.
But the phone still comes with the SIM tray, most likely. Look at the top left. That's where the key fits.
Google Hangouts. I got my note 5 in Malaysia and I was surprised that it was mostly bloat free. And there were a couple of Google Apps and some Samsung apps, galaxy life etc. The total amount of apps were about two app drawers. I didn't disable anything else. 
Google voice could do that I think.  Its a bitch with VZW though.
Create a Google account to link the phone with in case it is lost. There is a device manager that can help you retrieve the phone. Just don't forget the email like my roommate did. 
Even at that point the RAM takes up so little battery life I would think 17 mins would be on the high side of drainage.
So jealous of the silver ~I just ordered skins to hide my shame
I have their insurance, but its manufacturers warranty that I got mine replaced under, and also where that phone number directs too. Alsoo I get a brand new device rather than a refurbished one which is nice.
Not sure in USA but it's cheaper in Uk to buy phone outright then get a decent sim contract .I bought note5 for ??44then have unlimited data for ??17 a month compared to ??39 a month for 24 months with typical 4gb limit. 
You have to use a different launcher, like Nova and assign the home key to that new camera app.
Nice! What widget is that?
Actions memos can't be pin onto homepage, Samsung clock with weather widget and the wallpaper motion. That's the only ones I've noticed.
I forgot about the Gear VR! If I ever get my 10dollar credit I may get that. The Gear S2 is meh to me. I'm more than  happy with my Pebble Time.
I have never had trouble using MST at a EMV terminal. In some cases where the NFC reader is very close to the card reader (on a tiny terminal) it can be hard to choose which you are using because the sensitivity of the readers vary on different terminals, so the MST swipe may be sent before you are close enough to use NFC or vice versa. The only real issue I've run into on occasion is using the drive-through terminals at Wendy's since they have NFC disabled, but if you hold your phone too close to the NFC reader it still tries to use NFC and the transaction won't go through. The trick is to only hold the phone on the side where the card reader is and the MST transaction will go through just fine.
Went from Note 4 to Note 5 and the 5 crushes the 4. Smaller size, slightly better screen and camera, much better UI, so much smoother it's ridiculous.I hated the 4 once I used the 5.
I've had trouble with sending pictures sometimes too over sms, so I have to change the megapixels down
I haven't messed with the system enough honestly. I just found out you can reply text messages with the system too. It was paired with my iPhone 6 plus before and I don't remember being able to doing that. And having ability to reply on my Pebble is awesome as well.
Yes it did but I still want to know what's going on with gallery because I have a lot of burst photos and gallery will let me delete them all at once 
For great protection, I'd go with the case I use: UAG Ash.  It's very protective so it's thicker (still very easy to hold IMO) but it has a clear hexagon styled back.  I have a white phone so I really like the way it looks.
The Cables shipping with the unit are faulty. Im using a 7 year old cable from HTC and it works flawlessly. Just grab yourself a 28 AWG USB charging cable off ebay or amazon if that floats your boat!
Great. We sound like the same kind  of user. The writing on screen when off is a game changer for me. But, can I save it to keep? If not that's a bummer I'll just have to get used to a different note app.
You can use tasker to set what long pressing home button does. Mine opens voice search. I don't know about changing the the double click camera one though. 
Only thing you will be missing for now is Samsung Pay as only US carrier branded models (except for Verizon as of now) are currently supported.  
&gtWhat was the point of this shitpost anyway?while you make a valid argument, a lot of people complaining about battery life are complaining because they cant dick around on their phone for 8 hours a day. Less your 3 hours spent using it for things that haven't interfered with any social situations or productivity whatsoever are you going to use it for 5 hours when you get home? And if you do, are you really going to complain about it when you have a charger in your home?The point is that not having 8 hours screen on time shouldn't be as big of a deal as most people make it. 
Just got Note5 2 weeks ago. I did not return it in 14 day time.. so its not bad. But this is the first time since 2001 when getting a new phone it didnt blow me away. I had to buy the amazon battery case. Cheap and pretty good (does block stylus) but easy off and on. Its mehh but I kept it, so dont think its a lemon or horrific. 
I wish that was the case for me but sadly is not.  I'm going to reflash my rom in hopes that fixes it. well see.
I used the remote all the time! At first, not so much, but when you get used to it, it's so handy. I have one TV that's missing a remote... no problem! I always have my phone on me. After a while I wouldn't even look for the remote I did have, because I always had my phone on/near me.The loss of the IR blaster was the biggest thing for me when stepping up to the Note 5. I can use an OTG cable for removable storage... no biggie... The battery.. I never swapped it out. If that's a big deal to you get a portable battery/charger.The speed of the Note 5 has made the upgrade a no brainer for me. I was actually happier with the performance of the Note 3 more so than the Note 4.
I need the stylus and stylus apps for studying. 
Could be, I just kept turning it on and off for whatever video it was, I'll give it a try with a vertical video and rotation locked and see what happens. Edit: yep it appears to be working correctly for me too now, strange. 
By the way, if using ES file Explorer, go into settings then display to enable hidden files
Does the Ringke Fusion case work with a wireless charger?
Yes once I swapped out the cables it said Fast Charging on the first plugin. 
I'm sure that is due to the way the digitizer is configured for the Spen. It's got the proximity deal for that, and I can't imagine it uses the exact same digitizer Tech as other phones. It's way precise. It sounds like a trade off for me, but I had the musical homescreem problem a lot more with my m8
I have both of these cases. The Spigen case is just a basic TPU Case with no hard areas.  For protection, the UAG is way more protective and the main case that I use. I only use the Spigen around the house. The UAG is slightly thicker, but way more durable. The Spigen has a matte like texture so at times it is hard to grip. Overall, the UAG has the best combination of thinness and protection. 
Would I be able to buy one from somewhere on the internet??
I have the speck candyshell case and I love it. It matches my phone color and protects it well while keeping it slim.
Playing music causes my phone to not vibrate or has weaken vibration. My work around was to stop the music and lock the phone for about 5 seconds and vibration is back.Edit: by stop I meant close the app.
I just checked and I'm getting 80/8Mbps on wifi...Try resetting factory defaults on the router and setting it up again. If not, it's probably cheaper to try a new router than to buy a new phone...
I have the white. Fingerprints on the screen show up big time. I have a clear case and the fingerprints aren't as bad on the back.To me, the black looks too blue in certain light. 
My three: Fleksy, which has the record for fastest keyboard and has some cool backgrounds. Clarity, which is Swiftkey's super simple version of a keyboard, and Minuum, which minimizes the keybaord to barely take up any of the screen, yet still maintains typability, and if you really need to, you can drag it up to get a full size keyboard.
So, ah, do you think you could put in a flexible PV panel back there and somehow connect it to your battery???
Yep, a cracked back is probably the EASIEST thing to repair.  If you don't own a heat gun, just get it replaced for $100ish locally.  Or as a shop how much for the repair if you bring your own part (purchased online).
You can go to gallery, select your desired picture, click more, and set it as a wallpaper 
Not willing to sacrifice S Pen functionality. I'll wait for the wireless charging case 
Should be 1440x256(portrait).  2560x144(landscape) is a common desktop resolution and from experience there are a ton of wallpapers that size (my PC monitor is 1440p) but frustratingly some awesome ones are only 1080p.
See the screen shot, hope that helps. (http://imgur.com/NTp52Oj.jpg)
The cable doesn't matter, meaning as long as you have the Fast Adapter that came with your phone, the phone will fast charge. You may buy any USB cable to do this. Theory tested myself earlier today: used a different cable with Fast Adapter and Fast Charge initiated. 
You can also raise your hand while in selfie mode and it will start a 3 second timer. You might have to enable it in the camera settings though. 
Have you updated Google Play Services and rebooted?
Exactly. I don't get how people can like their iPhones, especially for the price they pay them. My sister paid more for her iPhone 6S than I did for my Note 5 + Quick Wireless Charger + Gear VR
Do you know if this update fixes the cell standby bug?
There is a free gift from the galaxy store that does that. I personally haven't used it I use https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nll.screenrecorder. it really surprised me how well it recordes. I was able to record at 1080p 6fps with no stutters while emulating WipEout Pure for PSP. It takes a little while to get used to how you have to use it. I have a few videos of me using it on an lg g4 on my YouTube channel www.youtube.com/user/krypticnexus   the Android goat simulator video I use that software. Hope this helps.Here is a video using that nll software. https://youtu.be/9t_PHG9kHdE
Thank you for disagreeing in such a civil manner. It's a refreshing change from what I usually receive. What's your method for applying a screen protector properly? I've used a flat edged, non-sharp surface and used that to slide along the protectors surface as I slowly roll it onto the screen and I still get bubbles. 
I have the unlocked version without carrier and I was wondering about this too
Thanks for complimenting may layout! I'm not really sure what unlocked means. I have mine with T-Mobile and love it. Also I never jail broke an iPhone, so I can't compare jail breaking to rooting. But when you root a phone, you're replacing the stock kernel with an outside one. Think of the kernel as the phone's core: what makes it tick. You do this by flashing, or installing. All you have to do is download a prgram called Odin, then the kernel you want to use. Connect your phone to a PC, and with the click of a button, you flash the kernel you want to use. And voila, your phone is rooted. The next step is to flash a custom recovery -that's the program you use to put your phone into recovery mode- because you can't flash ROMS using stock recovery. That's as easy as downloading the custom recovery you want, connecting your phone to a PC, and using Odin just as you did to flash the kernel. Lastly, download the zip file of the ROM you want onto your phone. Then start your phone in recovery mode, and from there you flash the ROM. It's that easy. The best advice I can give you is to not be scared and have plenty of time to do this in case you make a mistake you have to fix. I was really freaked out when I first did it. But there's nothing to be afraid of. I even bricked my phone. That I know of, however, there's little that you do that can't be undone. I've also simplified the process a bit, but if you'd like, I can send you links to the articles I used as a guide. Also, I'm a noob. So if a more experienced user would like to correct anything I've said, please do so.
What model is it? I use an sm-n920c. It came with a European adapter but it works just fine on ATT. You need to look at what bands your particular model supports. I believe most international note 5 will work on any GSM carriers like ATT or T-mobile
That is an issue with your phone. I take mine off the charger at 5:40AM, get five hours SoT over the day, including an hour and a half with GPS on and active, and still have ~10% left over when I get home at 7PM.
It was about 3-4 months ago, has there been an update since then?
Yup.  Most phones these days have a fused digitizer to make the phone thinner.  Trying to replace just the LCD outside of a cleanroom (an actual cleanroom) and without experience will result in dust and air bubbles under the glass.
i see, so its more of a detection thing?, like the phone recognizes that there is enough power coming in to 'fast charge' so it does? not a big deal but iv wondered how it works    
Me too, Note 8 running 5.1.1 - I thought maybe it was because I've flashed PAC Rom but it seems S Pen related from the reports I've found :(
Are you kidding? I get over six hours screen on time and so have many others that have posted screen shots....
I had their extended battery on the S5, that material was different.  Perhaps the square shape of the case helped with the grip, but it was definitely not as slippery as this one.  I think perhaps even a strip of soft rubber on the edges will  be helpful.  
BlekYou literally have to draw in it. You draw a line and it repeats itself, the objective is to hit all the dots and avoid obstacles. It's minimalistic in design and relaxing. I learned that my ability to draw straight lines is extremely lacking...
Font is called comfie
WOW. l literally just got the email saying I was approved and got the code for my $100. it Will be valid  from Dec 15 to 31
I was an avid user of lux but for some reason it causes issues for me and secondary windows. When installing an application that's not from the play store like amazon app store. For whatever reason with lux installed I couldn't press the install button. As soon as I out turn lux off it would work fine. Just an fyi
Keep wifi on during sleep is set on always
So I did this the first day, and I'm currently still on my first full charge. I stream spotify a lot in my commute, so I'm not getting crazy screen time, but I'm using a lot of battery with the screen off.
Just thought I'd throw this out there, but if you take the plunge and pay ~$10/month for a Google Play Music subscription, you get tons of songs to stream, commercial free youtube music videos, the ability to download YouTube videos to listen or watch offline, etc etc.You can also add your music files (I would recommend via a desktop, it's wicked easy) and listen to them anywhere (phone, browser, desktop) with or without the above subscription. 
Sent mine in last week because the battery got worse and worse. But I get it back tomorrow. Not too bad, considering the thanksgiving holidays that came up in the middle 
I haven't found a fix. I sent an error report to FB but I doubt they'll even see it. Is there anything we can do? I've been using FB Messenger as my main messaging app recently and I'd hate to have to switch away from it.
Download SD Maid from Play Store. Open SD Maid and select Biggest in the left side menu. It will show the apps that are the largest. 
I really only use it to add features to Snapchat, that's the main reason but whenever I get bored, I go surfing for new modules to try. I recently discovered a module for galaxy devices called Wanam xposed and it sorta adds back some necessary missing features and enhances without the trouble of flashing a custom rom 
The cable doesn't matter. It is the Note5 charger that enables the fast charging
I use Lightning Launcher and love it. [Here's my home screen](http://i.imgur.com/aKh2J4p.png) and [my app drawer](http://i.imgur.com/OB72Qsl.png)
Why did you block out so much of your about screen. In the future at least leave the build and baseband visible. You could easily get an update that doesn't change the version of Android.  Also the device shipped with 5.1.1
Nope, definitely can't find that menu on mine, maybe it's specific to nexus devices, or those made for the Japanese market. 
Didn't realize until I read this and I have never smelled animal feces other than my dog's. The pen's tip smells like plastic and my dog's poop is much more pungent than that. 
I have the GS6. The size is about perfect for me. I'm 5'2. When I first got my GS6 the battery life was crap. I restored the phone to factory and started from scratch and that made a remarkable difference for the better. Then 5.1.1 came out and it went back to crap. I am getting a Note 5 this week (love me some S-pen!?????) so I'm haven't bothered to restore it again. Maybe once I'm all set up on the N5. 
anyone gotten any scratches on the screen thus far?
Yeah, I completely recommend google play music. I even made the switch back when I was on an iPhone a year and a half ago, its a much better service. Plus you can set it to auto upload all music on your computer.
all software issues can be fixed, there is no permanent phone bricking.1. get TWRP recovery2. download a ROM and arter97 kernal3. download xposed (if you want ofc)4. get into TWRP and factory reset in wipe4. flash rom, kernal and xposed in TWRP5. reboot and enjoy.if you ever went through any bootloop which very rarely would happen, or any extreme cases, its simply entering download mode and plug to pc, open odin and flash a stock firmware. so yes you're pretty much always safe if you have enough knowledge about these stuff.
I'll probably give 'material dark' a shot. I always set my home screen wallpaper to plain black. I figure it will be nice to have a dark ui also, with the super amoled screen and all.
Just reading over the notes quick it looks like it still requires an unlocked bootloader, no?
Just make sure you buy one with a warranty. They easily chip and the one I have ships out a new one whenever I ask for one. The first one I had didn't have a halo but my second one did. I'm on my third replacement now and it doesn't have one. It's really a hit or miss.
So I couldn't find a fast charger at a store so I bought one off amazon. I'm glad to say it was the shitty charger that ships with the phone. I just plugged it in and it's fast charging again ???

Yep. Are just running stock? I go to PVZ in the play store and the download button isn't there and it says it's not compatible 
That's it? I get about 10hr SoT,  but standby isn't very good.  Pic is on 10hr battery. Usually lose 9% per hour of screen time, and 1-3% per hr standby. http://imgur.com/M4viMA9
For contacts, go to icloud.com and login to get apple axcount, click contacts, select all of them, bottom left there is a menu with an option to export (does not work in chrome), note where the file get saved, go to her new Google account on the same computer Google.com/contacts I think, on this page you can import that .vcf file or whatever it is.As for photos and notes I do not know. You could always just save the photos to your computer from the same icloud.com where you got contacts.
Use smart switch app
Awesome. This perspective definitely makes sense, plus to think of it they too know very well that everybody is gonna be using the home button a lot more than power button (especially after introduction of a fingerprint sensor). Thank you! 
That's the reason why I have gone with wireless charging.  Stick your cable into the wireless charging once and that's it. No continual plugging/unplugging of the charge cable.  No ruining your charger ports or cables over time.  In the past year or so I have switched to wireless charging, I have yet to ruin a cable.  I only use wired charging in the car for quick top offs (if I ever need them) which is rare since my Note 5 goes all day and charges on the wireless pad at night before I go to bed.  If you ever need a good charging pad, check out the Choetec Fast Wireless charging pad on Amazon.  Almost as fast as using the wired quick chargers.
I like the look of the wallpaper changing for the app-bar
I've been having the same issue. At one point the phone took 4 hours to fast charge . Coming from an iPhone, I'm highly disappointed. 
No. It came with a regular micro USB cable and the pad. And they recommend me to use it with my original fast charger. Works like a charm. 
Change your USB cable it's bad just like everyone else who had the same issue. Including myself. 
i came from a 16gb iphone6+ to the 64gb note5  - im only using 24gb at the moment - are you using the google drive or the onedrive free storage?
Lol nope. Any photo I take is flipped, including screenshots.
I'm pretty sure you can disable finger input with a gesture. Draw an 8 on the screen that is shipped like a square (4 corners with X in the middle)
Got it over the s6 edge + just for the off screen memo..... Jot down a whole heap a notes and idea and girl phone numbers too ?????? 
It also offer drop protection somewhat.   I have seen many dropped phone where the glass protector cracked but the screen glass was safe.  Scratch can also come from sand/ dirt/ debris in your pocket.   And ladies are notorious for tossing the phone into a purse  loaded with keys and other hazardous objects
Yeah I know how that works, but as I mentioned I'm looking for a sticky note that I can pin to the home screen and write on there. A) because sometimes I already have the pen out and want to jot something down quick without going into menus/apps, and b) because I'd like that info to be readable without opening any app, like an actual sticky note. Thanks though
Sadly. I would gladly pay double the price for double the storage, no 64 gb for $2 lol.
Does it actually charge slower when it says cable charging? Just curious. I haven't had or heard of this issue. 
That??s the thing, the usb settings don??t even come up in the notifications, it just says cable charging.
You don't have to pick at the edges.... 
Do you have accidental warranty on your phone? Because you're going to need it. 
I think it's kinda funny that their website doesn't mention anything about it being out of stock or backordered. The page for the charger just says ships in 1-3 business days. Meanwhile I can walk into best buy and buy one if I wanted. Makes me wonder if it actually is backordered or if they just want to try and make people give up on waiting and buy it anyway. 
You should qualify, but with little over a week left to get it done. It's through the Samsung Pay app on your new phone. If you get signed up on the app and add a credit card to it, then an announcement within the app gives you the link to get your wireless charger. You've got until Nov 8 to get the app activated with a card and until Nov 15 to submit an offer claim. Here's the other [requirements](http://imgur.com/6iujuZS.jpg). If you're looking for more info, all the [details are found here:](http://www.samsung.com/us/samsung-pay/?cid=ppc-) with the redemption option near the bottom.
Same here, it's nowhere to be found under NFC payment only Android pay. When I installed Samsung Pay it never asked me if I wanted to set as default. I did same as you with the side load etc. Have not done a reset because I don't wanna ???
I like Samsung Pay, but I'm getting a little annoyed at these limitations.In the announcement they said it would support gift cards and membership cards too. They aren't even supporting all credit cards and debit cards yet. I've become very pessimistic that I'll EVER be able to load in a gift card or a store membership card.
Probably depends how you use it. While screen on, shouldn't be a big one. But if you use the tap to wake it may be.
The Pure is great. Doesn't have the AMOLED screen, but battery still great. 
5 Days, I'm not holding my breath on that one.  Talked to a CSR who said she didn't know, but heard a rumor it would come with Marshmallow... which is expected in December.  Hope she's wrong.
I have uninstalled and reinstalled a couple of times, it didn't help. Do you open the app every time you take the phone off charge or is there some permission I need to enable or something? I loved gsam on my nexus 5, but it's useless on my note. 
No just install and add a card to samsung pay by october 10th it's the last day so hurry!
Have the same one in a different color. Absolutely love it. The buttons are really responsive, and the S-Pen is easy to get to. 
Finicky to even start a charge. If you do get it exactly right on the pad and it starts to charge, it will only charge for ~5min before it disconnects. It won't start to charge again until you pick it up and put it back perfectly. Then there was supposidly some fix where you have to turn on day dreaming. That didn't work for me either. And God forbid you have a case on your phone then all bets are off. If it did some how magically charge to 100% it would auto disconnect and never reconnect if the battery goes to 99%. I was waking up to 82% battery because it would go to 100% then drop off till I woke up. There are tons of info on these things being garbage.I returned it and bought this: https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B015351VC2/ref=pd_aw_ys_2335752011_b2_3?pi=SS115Holy fuck what a difference. Phone case on and ZERO problems. Works flawlessly. 5/5
What country are you in, and does it have Samsung pay? I'm looking to get one for Canada, anyone know if Fido or Bell will work well on it? Also, how is your signal strength?

http://imgur.com/79CUKyY.jpgSeems to just be missing that. I was just curious about the setting I don't actually have any issues with my spenEdit: actually I just realised that setting IS there. It is just named differently :|
I'm rooted, with plenty of xposed modules running.  S-Pen works as well as it did day one. 
Someone else posted a solution to this issue here and it worked brilliantly for me - just douse a Q-tip in rubbing alcohol and rub the buttons with it. It'll be back to normal in no time, no need to hand your phone in for repairs or anything.
This. in fact, is alarming. Does it only lose that click / stiffness, or stops registering the press at all? I might be able to live with a soft button (well no, not actually) but if it stops registering the button press then I might just trade it for 6P or something. 
Well for me personally note 5 was the only choice cuz I wanted a stylus,  and I love the thing.  If not for that I prolly would have gotten a nexus 6p or something,  but idk if it has wireless fast charge.  I literally can not live without wireless fast charge now that I've experienced it. 
Well, FedEx left my chargers on my next door neighbor's doorstep for no apparent reason. I called and filed a complaint about it. They said they would call me back today but never did... doesn't even surprise me.
I use the theme *Darkness* along with *Nova Launcher Prime* and either the *Flight* or *Min* icon packs
Well I'll be damned -- this is the answer. Works perfectly. Thank you!  I'm gonna miss my Google Now launcher, though :( 
I had both personaly that's not a bad deal. Out of the 2 I would go note 5. Imho Samsung took less time to fix some of the issues with the phone than lg did with the g4 and Samsung Pay is pretty awesome aswell. And the battery life is leaps and bounds better although I may have had a bad unit who knows. 
I'm on three and have the N920C. Connected to 4G right now 
SideSync is amazing and Samsung has a native application for Mac. It handles everything including file transfers. 
I agree that it's slippery. All of my accidents with it have been because it slipped right out of my hand after holding it with normal pressure. Interestingly enough, most of the time I have to readjust the phone and drop it is because my pinky naturally covers the speaker on the bottom and I like to listen to music while I browse/pr0n/play games. 
I use SD maid to clean all that for me, especially when I go through and purge apps. Can't remember if its free or not
Also sync for reddit.... for sure my favorite
Not sure if I'd trust third party chargers just yet but maybe I'm paranoid
Yes. I can tell you a lot about this. How much battery life I get depends largely on where I'm at and the cell reception I get there. With the modifications I've made, I usually get anywhere between 5.5 and 7.5+ hours of Screen on Time. Here's what I did.1) Open the Phone app, then select more, then settings. Disable VoLTE and WiFi calling.2) Go into your WiFi settings, press more, then advanced. Make sure that always allow scanning is turned off.3) Go to your account settings and make sure auto sync is turned off.4) Go into your display settings and make sure your Screen more is basic.5) As a personal preference, I also turned off all vibrations for all alerts. I don't need them.6) Download Package Disabler Pro. It will allow you to choose which apps to disable. Now here is where it gets tricky. Disabling certain apps will affect your ability to enjoy the phone as it was designed. I personally don't care about that, and would rather have longer battery life, and use only the apps that I need. The only app I constantly turn on and off is the Google app. When I'm in the car, for instance, I'll need the ability to dictate to my phone. So the app is always on. When I'm at my desk, I barely use my phone, so it's off to conserve battery life. I have nearly 20apps disabled and have noticed little to no lag in performance.7)Download Greenify in order to keep apps that are enabled but that you're not using disabled.8) Enjoy your phone!
I believe it's called 'Touchwiz home', but I'm not 100%. 
I love this app and used it on all of my note devices. So awesome. But I actually use the swipe up to go back to the home screen. 
I'll give you both of mine if you get me a fast wireless charger in exchange lmao
yeah they are legit, they are brittle and the edges will get chipped first so make sure you get one that''s 0.2mm (not 0.3mm) and one with curved edges. the thinner protector just has a better feel you'll hardly notice it, and curved edges means they are much less prone to chipping 
I wanna say theres a page on Samsung promos that you can check the status of your gift by entering your email. Mine continues to say pending and I signed up two weeks ago. And nothing for BB and samsung credits. 
I've tried connecting my phone to Windows 1laptop but it won't show up. Even after installing the drivers from the Samsung website. Any help? 
It's not covered under Samsung warranty.  They consider the S-Pen an accessory and refused to replace mine when this same thing happened.  I took it to both the Sprint store and contacted Samsung directly.
I'm not going to pretend to know exactly what the answer is. I'm not that tech savvy. But the same thing happened to me after rooting the phone, and in my case, it was related to the Samsung VR Gear framework. I freaked out at first and thought my charging port had broken. But I deleted Samsung Gear from my phone and the problem went away.
I heavily use mine as a hotspot when I'm out of town, and while it gets pretty warm and drains the battery fast (of course), I don't see or encounter any problems so far. 
$10for 60% more battery life with a grain of salt
Open Galaxy Apps and look along the top of the homepage for the 'For Galaxy' tab. Galaxy Gifts will be listed on that page, then you just browse until you find ArtRage.
Thanks a lot for your help and insight. Thought I am using package disabler pro but all my packages have been disabled for a long time and I started getting this problem just recently so I don't think this should be a problem! 
Just got them this Monday, the 7th. Got both the Swarovski holiday bundle and a $5check from Samsung. I had just gotten an email on Dec 3 saying my submissions had been approved. I did Jump with tmobile to the Note 5 and submitted the requests on Nov 7
I was able to make my Moto G totally transparent!  Went through a whole pack of razors scraping the color off.  Also, it's hard to find when I forget where I put it.  http://imgur.com/YKUIl5W
You know, thinking back, I never had to swap out my Note4 battery, and with Power Save on this one, I only run out if I phone binge for 5+ hours, so not as bad as I'd initially worried. Stupid that they actually removed features since the iPhones aren't offering the features, but with this extended battery life, don't think it's so bad after all.
Brightness is at 50%, didn't think that would make it that bad 
Huh....I figured out the problem. Apparently the galaxy s6 edge plus isn't supported for wifi. It can connect to tablets and other phones, but for Internet on the computer, it has to be connected via USB port. Interesting. I wonder if they'll fix that soon
I believe you can buy a new spen on amazon... not 100% sure though
Biggest issue is that click and holding the home button takes me to Google Now, but releasing the button takes me straight back to the home screen. My work-around was to launch the Google app with a swipe-up gesture in Nova Launcher instead, which is not too far off from my previous couple of phones with no physical home button.
I use Titanium to disable but I followed the same exact thing I did in every previous ROM. I only added Android Wear here. 
Yup I got the Ringke case and love it 
You might have put too much pressure on device when bending over or sitting down if it's in your back pocket and much worst if wearing them hipster tight pants. If at front pocket you might have hit a table or some other edge.
I have yet to use Ultra Power Saving. When do you use yours?
Agreed. But its nice to know of a method of retreving the S-pen without breaking or dismantling the phone.
Fast charge is so fast that I usually don't even bother plugging in at night.   I get up in the morning, plug it in, and by the time I'm finished with shower, coffee,  and getting dressed, it's fully charged. 
I wonder why they did the update, it doesn't seem logical to play music while on a phone call
Note 5.Wireless chargingSamsung Pay
I have also been looking for something like this.  I just got my Note 5 yesterday and would love to get a wireless charger.  I would also like to know if these are any good.  At such a low price, might as well pick up a few!
Yes!!! It is also WAY better than the new Surface pro pen, which is both heavy and inaccurate. I love the S Pen and just purchased a Note Pro because of it! Amazing to hand write notes - the light, easy pen is definitely the way to go. 
Same here. I'm deciding between the Edge+ and Note 5. I think I'll be going with the Note simply because of more feature-packed software as well as the stylus (i.e. more fun on Snapchat :P)
Try redoing your fingerprints again
I havent had any connection issues. As matter of fact the mintute i turn off bluetooth the s2 connects via wifi so quick i dont even notice not being connected. Every aspect of this watch is just perfect. Just waiting for tizen to be more popular. I always had problems with moto 36when i turn on bluetooth on the note 5. But with the s2 its connects without any issue. All i do is turn on bluetooth and i am done. 
I have a sprint phone as well. I use no lock screen.  I'm pretty sure I am fully updated, and u can't use Samsung pay cuz my bank isn't supported. 
I recently upgraded from an S3 to the Note 5 (8 days ago actually), and the home button on my S3 still works just as well as it did when I first got it, 3.5 years ago. Assuming the build quality on these phones hasn't gone down (definitely not true), the home button should last you easily the lifetime of the device.
Don't  worry you'll  get an email from samsung and look at the 10certificate  use by date, mine came on the 10th and they made me used it starting at the 15th for some reason.
I dont know about the Note 4 but the Note 5 is ridiculously warped at the top and bottom of the screen (front facing). Look like im a damn alien. Bet you samsung does nothing about this defect.
I'm waiting for my approval. I want that Gear VR. What are you planning on spending your rebate on?
8 months? Phone hasn't been out that long. Anyways have you tried using a file Explorer and going to your photos folder and deleting them that way. 
Kipp from FullContact here - Thanks for the mention, /u/FrostedBits!To /u/PrezzNotSure, while I don't own a Galaxy Note 5, I do have quite a bit of experience with duplicates in the world of cloud contacts. &gt I'm wondering if it has something to do with Verizon, Google, lookout, and waze all backing up contacts, one of those sees missing contacts after merge and restores them allThis does seem like a likely scenario. Another potential wrinkle would be if you have multiple cloud sources syncing with each other - for instance, if you sync Facebook contacts into your device contacts, but also have your Facebook friends tied to Waze, and Waze is also synced to your device contacts, this can sometimes create a nasty redirect loop.My recommendation when people are seeing duplicates is always to simplify. Choose your one primary cloud contacts solution, disconnect everything else, then start adding the others back one by one until you see it start to happen again. (Naturally, I'm a little biased as to the solution I recommend for this sort of thing - but if you don't need all the power features of our apps, Google Contacts can do just as well as a simple hub.)Good luck!
Thanks! I actually disabled location reporting last night. We'll see what happens with battery life! I don't really use Google Now that much anyways so I'll see if I notice a difference in usability. I guess the beauty of Android is that if I want to, I can always just switch it back on! 
Notification LED!    You will come to love that little light and miss it if you ever switch back.        I do miss getting a quick glance on who messaged me though.  
That looks about right.  You can debloat with package Disabler pro and save a little extra but I wouldn't really worry about ram usage unless you're actually running out.
I experience lag with the keyboard especially when I open Google search.  Also I experience lag with relay pro animations and just in general.  I have a good amount of bloat disabled too.  I'm really disappointed with this phone's performance especially with the random battery drain from android os or system.
I got this charger when I got my note and I'm very pleased with it. It's set up on my entertainment center for quick power ups when I need them. Awesome charger. 
Samsung Pay can toggle NFC on and off when you use it, even if you have NFC off.
Hmmm. Guess we will just cross our fingers that Samsung fixes this soon then. 
Thanks. I've done all that with the keyboard a few times. I've wiped hte phones cache plenty as well. I don't ever use battery saver mode. 
I seriously hope Samsung fixes this in marshmallow but my hopes are pretty low considering they said they weren't even aware of the over aggressive ram management.  I think I'm starting to feel buyers remorse.Edit:  Contacted Samsung and they're not even aware of this issue.  It's a 2015 flag ship, why is this still a problem?
This lets you disable anything just like root, without root access.  A PC is required with some basic knowledge about Developer Options, Debug mode, having the right Samsung/ADB drivers.But it really works.  My carrier forced their cloud storage app that is set to be always running in the background.  I didn't mind it for a year because it stayed relatively dormant on the Note 4, but then with an update, they forced wakelock enabled popup notifications, which would just keep the screen on if I had my S view cover closed.  That was the last straw.  I had no other reason to root, except this, but luckily, I found this utility.  They put the same thing on my Note 5, and guess what one of the first thing I did was when I got this phone.  :)http://forum.xda-developers.com/android/software/debloater-remove-carrier-bloat-t2998294
Not seeing that on my menu. I have the Sprint version. And I've been using the stock charger. I had issues with my phone and it died so I got it replaced so I was using the old one and now I'm using the new one
This happens to me as well. I hope it's a bug that's fixed in the Marshmallow update because it can get pretty annoying. 
I meant full GPS, not full WiFi 
Check out the spigen slim armor
Cool. Just rooted my note 5 and now Samsung Pay keeps coming up I think I'm going to disable it entirely since none of my cards work for it anyway.
Nevermind, got email today and also backordered. 
I should mention the display improvements are mostly in efficiency and max brightness. Makes it so much easier to see in direct sunlight.
I'm sure I'll have the Note 6 in my hands before Marshmallow hits the Note 5.
You read need and equated it as a primal need. Obviously, humanity has existed for millions of years without them so we can't be discussing basic necessities in the primal sense. Having an SPen, depending on what you do for a living can really increase productivity. I was able to sign my mortgage refinance documents within 1minutes of receiving them and sent them right back.OP was griping about the design choices of Samsung. How do you expect a company to change their approach if you do not provide feedback? While this isn't an official Samsung site where they gauge feedback, I'd say it would be pretty ignorant to think they don't pay attention to the forums. &gtDidn't think my opinion would make people angry, it is an opinion after all. Sorry if I offended...Nothing in your OC was an opinion. They were facts all addressed at the most literally sense of OPs comments and ignored any and all reasonable inference. That's why I was annoyed. Can't really speak for others though.
You could always get white and turn it pure black with leather texture from slickwraps or dbrands. Thats what i would do if i wasnt sure about the color or wanted best of both world. 
Yeah I saw that and that t-mobile is/was coming out with a similar feature. Too bad I have neither of those! I guess it's not too bad, it's just that this phone is SO MUCH louder than my last phone and I am in the process of moving. Empty house plus loud phone is not as much fun when it's phone calls and not music. 
that v1screen and speaker though...
you're not gonna get much at all out of a charger the size of lipstick, and it's not gonna be enough to charge your phone. 
My case allows the buttons to be exposed. I have not had any trouble with sticky buttons.  I've only had my Note 5 for about 4 weeks, tho. 
Something new Android users may overlook is the ability to change launchers. It's not a change to the TouchWiz software, but it is a new graphical interface. I like Aviate. It's by Yahoo, but don't let that deter you. It's actually pretty solid if you're an organizational freak. 
I have Sprint and there is a setting or two within the mms settings menu that I mess with.  But I think it's different for AT&ampT
I've had mine for a week, so I'm still conditioning a new battery. My last charge cycle was 6.5 hours of SoT. Only have a few things disabled, and I never turn things off like Bluetooth or location services.Not aware of a root method that preserves Knox fuse.
US?carriers should be unlocking them for you if you meet the eligibility requirements as it's part of federal law now.  For example, you can just submit it online at ATT now.ATT: https://www.att.com/deviceunlockTmobile: https://support.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-1588Sprint: https://www.sprint.com/legal/unlocking_policy.htmlVerizon: Verizon's LTE phones have never been sim locked.
Do you keep your screen brightness on auto? I feel like when I first got my phone and had the screen on full brightness all the time, my battery was pretty bad as well but now as I always keep the screen on auto, the battery lasts me a day easy. 
I've bought so many keyboards over the years. . . but I've settled on MessageEase. What is it abouh Swiftkey that everyone loves?
Don't get a screen protector they look shit on this phone. It's so hard to scratch these phones these days. Never scratched my iPhone 5 in 3 years and it has a lower quality glass
If you want a quick charger, grab this:Anker PowerPort+ 1 (Quick Charge 2.and PowerIQ Technology 2-in-1 18W USB Wall Charger) [amazon.com]Apply Code: 7KPXZH3Y at checkout. ($9.0Savings)Price (after coupon): $6.99http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014F3D8FQI got it for travel/work due to the foldable plugs. Good price since they're clearing it out for QC 3.stuff.
Install a new lockscreen, there some really nice ones are on the store that have that function to swipe to open a notification 
sometime a phone in high/fast drain situation can shutdown earlier than expected.don't go too cheap on the cable... ideally look for one that spec out 20awg and those should support fast charge for sure.  generic super cheap micro USB cable may not fast charge sometime.  I have a short 6 inch cable that came with a external battery pack that won't charge in fast charge mode. but charge fine at normal speed
For location settings make it so you're only using wifi and cellular networks.....I've noticed a big difference....especially on days when I'm not on my phone a lot
Thanks I bought the 6s plus. The note 5 feels better in my hand and I love relay reddit app,  but the battery life and stuff seems much better in 6s.
I have.  Samsung Galaxy Note 5 developed Bluetooth range and reliability problems coincident after use of Yootech wireless (inductive) charger plate (model: AM1020, 5V-1A).  Unfortunately, it did not occur at first charge, so I unable to conclude that the charger broke the Bluetooth system.
I have a Verizon Note 5.Have no issues with multitasking, but I normally don't go insane (~6 is most open + tabs).Battery Life: IMO very good, but I'm also used to some pretty poor battery phones.  Get through a day without ever worrying about it getting through a day.  Could get through two days if I really wanted to.  Typically charge at night around 40% after the phone has been off charger ~23 hours with ~3 hours SOT, sometimes higher.Verizon: Like the coverage for the most part (for some reason, my specific chair in the office is a great area of just on the edge of 4G and bounces into 3G.  But don't like the fact that you pay full price for a phone and get bloat preinstalled with like 2Verizon apps and they removed Smart Manager and they haven't approved Samsung Pay.
Getting 7hrs SoT isn't fake. I've gotten that much many times.  Anyone can kill a battery fast by nonstop using it. Maybe you have apps or something eating your battery life. Location services etc.. Anyway everyone uses their phone differently and will always have various results. 
I'd expect a VERY long time. Probably some time in mid 2016 if we're lucky. There are so many new requirements for 6.(google cracking down on third party BS) that Samsung is likely to have a rough time getting the updates out. 
So why don't you just do it? Why don't you become the savior all Note 5 users deserve and buy a bunch, alter them, and sell them at cost? I personally wouldn't buy it for $10but if a ton of other people will why can't he sell it for that? I'm sure eventually others will make them and the price will go down but that's what the price is right now. You either take it, wait for it to get cheaper, or you don't buy it at all. 
There are a lot of things with the Note 5 that are exceptionally inconvenient. Luckily they are software based, The main problem I'm finding with the battery drain issues is that this subreddit (being the easiest to navigate with good response times,) *insists* that, at once, the battery problems aren't that bad. And when you point out that they are, like this post, you get, duh location is on, lol, turn literally everything off when you're not using it.I've seen people who act like running PDP, and tasker, to automate switching everything off in certain conditions, is par for the course, when I've got an HTC M8 that literally lasted 3 full days as an alarm clock with WiFi on the whole time (not even in Extreme Power Saving Mode)It's not like the phone is useless, but the amount of Pfftt whatever man you get when you say, I don't like the idea that I have to basically tune up my phone and reconfigure a bunch of shit to get it to work.That said, I've noticed a significant increase in my battery life after a few days of jerking around with it. I'm not sure what I did exactly, so that kind of sucks. 
Right now there's not a ton of quality / useful stuff. Mainly bought it for Samsung pay and an alternative to my g watch r. It does have flappy bird though, Hooray for that. 
My note 5 says Plants vs Zombies 1 isn't compatiable with my phone in the play store. I can't even download it :( What's the fucking point of a phone if I can't play PvZ1. Fuck 2
Would not recommend Samsung gear s.  I picked it up for free from att and will be returning it. Doesn't work with textra and apps seem outdated. I would also like to see what watches are most favorable. 
What kind of theme are you using?
I indeed got the update today. I'm with Telus. Did all the Canadian carriers pushed the update today? (From the way your title is written).
Kind of a dumb question, but can you check to see how many SMS/MMS you have on the phone? With the way Android handles them, too many can even bring a phone this powerful to its knees.
About the same time frame for me. I went for the headphones though. Maybe I'll see it come in soon.
Should of been 128 gig from the start with every color available for all carriers. 
It's not that I need to, but on my m8, for instance, I had a tasker and pushbullet setup where when I unlocked my pc, all notifications went there, and locked my phone, and then when I got up and unlocked my phone, my pc would lock. And then I had a shortcut where I double pressed the power button and held it the second time, and it toggled the flashlight. I also used it for pentesting my home and work networks, and had things like dual Instagram sign ins, battery saving options, and I could change ROMs if I found something useful. I use *the shit* out of my cellphone, so I'm not saying it doesn't make sense that it's knoxed like it is, I just need a little extra functionality. It's a powerhouse, I'd love to see what I could do on this thing that I couldn't on my m8.
It has permission control, a feature i've been waiting for

I like this a lot. What icons are you using? 
I'm having a problem with registering where I get to the screen in the picture, and when I press start, the screen will give me a loading icon for a second and then nothing happens. 
Hence the value of having a swappable battery.  Bring on the downvotes, but it has to be said: non-removable battery is a giant step back for the note lineup.  As consumers,  we need to demand better products and not rationalize when companies try to justify changes like these
Lol thanks.  I've seen that.  You're technically correct so...  In really have only used the stylus a couple of times so this might be a legit option for me when I replace it this time.
I had rooted a long time ago on LG G2X, not sure if you guys remember that phone. Well, apparently there was a lawsuit on that phone and I got $5for that phone. But anyway, I'm digressing. Point is, I used to root and install new roms. One time I bricked my g2x but someone from XDA helped me out. Anyway, not sure if I'll ever do it again unless it's really, really easy lol
Did you download the package disabler and follow some of the battery saving tips on here? I was getting right around 3:2of SOT. I followed some of the steps and I am currently sitting at 4:17 with 34% battery left. Averaging over an hour and forty minutes more screen on time than before.It seemed to really help a lot. It is nice to use my phone from the time I get up, throughout my 12 hour shift, and some afterwards before plugging it in when I go to bed. It was not the greatest battery before. Now I get better battery life than I did with my Note 4, my iPhone 6/6S Plus, and double what I got with my S6.
Nope, not at all.  Microfiber or shirt.
Try another dialer like Contacts CallApp, see if that works 
Maybe I can help. I switched from the LG G3 to the Note 5 and wrestled with the same thing you are now. I know that's not the same as G4--but they're essentially the same phone. First off, if my hands were any smaller I would have a very hard time using the Note 5 one handed. I'm a lefty so the rear buttons, customizable placement of nav controls on screen, and knock wake/sleep were very big positives on the G3/4. You may wonder why I went with the Note5--one reason was raw power. The Note 5 chip is simply much faster than what they put in the  G4. I couldn't imagine upgrading to a phone that was basically the same as last year's model. They also increased the size of the G4 from the G3....gone are the near imperceptible bezels which made the phone wider for no apparent reason. There is almost no bezel at all on the Note 5. I love S Amoled. The LG screen just has a dark grey at best (this may be improved on the G4, but it's still the same tech). Blacks are BLACK on the Note 5. S-Pen, I love using it, it becomes really handy on some websites. Also, I can use it to scroll and tap as a two handed method of using the phone rather than getting my thumb in the fixed bent position for the constant scrolling--it's actually a more relaxing way to use the device. The phone feels more premium with glass and metal over the plastic G3/4. Simple. Get a case on either one though, a dropped phone is a cracked phone for both models.  I use a simple spigen brand case---I dropped my phone out of my lap from my car onto the cement and it survived without a scratch. Today i double flipped the phone, landed on a wood chair arm, and landed another 3 feed to the ground....survived no problem. Luck? Maybe.TouchWiz is hardly even a problem any more than anything aside from vanilla experience. There is a lot of customizability, and with as much ram as this thing has, I actually use Nova Launcher. I almost didn't use a launcher because I didn't hate TouchWiz this time....but I didn't want to set up the phone twice so I just set it up with Nova the first day. I have full use of all the Samsung specific features (S-pen, screen writing, S-Health, fingerprint scanner etc.)I never took out the battery on the LG except to force reset it when it was acting funky (and would get REALLLLLLY HOT). The samsung does not get nearly as warm even under heavy use. Damn I forgot until just now how HOT the LG would get. And depending on how much you keep stored on your phone, you may want to opt for the 64gb version of the Note 5, that's what I did. So far I haven't filled it up much--but I didn't even want it to be an issue so I paid the bit extra for the storage. If you have any more questions I'll do my best to answer them. I've had HTC One M9, LG G3, Galaxy S3/4, Fascinate (back when), Incredible 2, Thunderbolt etc, etc, etc. So I've experienced the different iterations of TouchWiz, LG Software, and HTC. 
Lockscreen has a slight overlay that is always there, just easier to see on darker wall papers.. There is no native way to remove it though.
I've been liking the Samsung browser. Anyone have any idea how to go back in Google chrome? I can't seem to find that 
Yeah, I uninstalled, restarted and reinstalled this morning. Fingers crossed.EDIT: That didn't fix the issue for me. Spotify died after about 1minutes of inactivity. 
Verizon phones are already SIM unlocked.  You will get LTE on band 2 and 4 on MetroPCS, but not band 12 since the Verizon model doesn't have band 12.  Also if you are not in a refarmed 1900Mhz area (not many of those areas left but there are a few left), you will only get EDGE since the Verizon version does not support 1700Mhz.  But most areas have been refarmed to 1900Mhz (PCS) so you should at least get 3G/HSPA+ speeds if no LTE.
Samsung's been doing the physical homebutton for as long as anyone.  They know what they're doing.  I've had the S4, S5, Note 10.1 Tablet and Note 5 while my wife's had the S4, and now S6, and never have either of us had an issue with the homebutton wearing out.  I think you'll be fine, so long as you're not pressing it abnormally hard.
I've looked, but I can't even see where this would be, inside that menu there's 6 more options, and I can't find a screen like the image 
Ah I do indeed, I was trying to figure out if I disabled anything relating to battery but couldn't. Thanks! Appreciate it~
I get the feeling this will have to do with a different app, indirectly. This will be a dns daemon, and may by trying to resolve a dns name constantly at the request of another app. Try reverting recent app installs till it goes away to find the culprit.DNS names are names like google.com or facebook.com, for your device to talk to them these names need to be resolved to IP addresses.The only other problem I could think of is your net providers DNS server is down, but then the internet wouldn't work at all on your phone if you tried going to sites you haven't been to before (assuming older DNS entries are cached).
I just bought one off eBay last week when mine snapped in half (the metallic part at the top snapped off from the plastic part). Got it on Thursday, works just like the old one, came with a new set of tips as well. Was like $20
Apparently, the camera is very similar on the Note 5 and 4, but the camera software on the 5 makes it better. The stylus' look has changed, but the features remained the same. Oh, and it's still plastic. But now it clicks like a pen!As for updates, the Note 4 probably won't be getting Android N, and you know for sure the Note 5 will be updated for a year more than the Note 4.
Clean Master. Not sure how useful it is but I use it
Some apps will do that as a way to make sure they aren't cleared from memory. You might be able to go into the app's settings and turn off the persistent notification. If it doesn't have the option you can go into the application manager, find the app, and uncheck 'show notifications.'
You don't have to actually pay the money. I activated the sim over the phone and never funded it and got the update.
Just completed my update. Less than 200MB.
I'm using the sPen now on themer and it works fine. I didn't use it before installing themer so I wouldn't Know if I lost any features with themer.
You can turn that off. Go to Settings&gtSpen
Actually the bezel will take the impact unless it falls **perfectly** flat. A glass screen protector raises it enough that impact to the front is a bit easier.
I've been unsuccessful with all of them cause my bank doesn't work with Samsung pay. Worth a shot though!!
Phone brand new? When you take the pen out with screen on, does the air command menu come on?
Tried this and it just said i had to wait several hours to try and update again. Changed my time forward and the update failed again.
Thank you for that. I started changing my voice commands a bit and now they're showing up in calendar. Makes a lot of sense in retrospect. 
Correct, Samsung Pay.
Install gsam and see what's eating your battery
The uag case looks pretty cool. Do you know if it would work with a wireless charger?
Thanks for the tip, i'm just wondering is there anyway to use emojis when I have the default keyboard set to swype? I looked in the settings since I didn't like the standard Samsung keyboard and switch it over. However I don't see an emoji option with it on the twitter app. Is there any way to use emojis with this keyboard on twitter?
Things like that are what annoy me most about Android. I have to disable key features to get good battery life. I'll give it a try though )
I use mine as a hotpot constantly on tmobile. The device definitely gets warm and the battery impact is fairly substantial. However I haven't really experienced anything that would make me stop using it as a hotspot 
You need to download the extra camera effects from the Samsung store
Curious. Why don't you want to use any Google services or the play store? 
I have both the Note 5, and 6Plus. 6Plus jailbroken running many tweaks still out preforms my note 5 when it comes to battery. I can go forever on my iPhone it seems. My note on the other hand, I expected more. I've disabled things I don't need, and disabled sync all together. I'm just not getting what I thought an $80phone would give me.
Same problem. T Mobile refused to help. I was writing with the S Pen and the top literally shot off. Found the spring, put it back together, shot off again. Can't find the spring. Totally effed. Not happy with T Mobile or Samsung. 
Thank you so much, I thought smartmanajer was just the widget
I have no clue what could cause this, but maybe wifi calling us enabled and its constantly looking for calls? I can't use wifi calling so this is just a guess.
For what bundle?  I read the link I shared and it referenced trading in iPhone trade in.    I guess I missed something. Please elaborate and thank you for your input !!!I purchased a Verizon Samsung Galaxy Note 5 two or three weeks ago which was an upgrade from a Verizon Samsung Galaxy S5... I can't find where I'm eligible for this offer please enlighten me thank you!
Android Pay won't work if your phone is rooted. Apparently there's an Xposed mod that allows you to get around it, but all in all if you're looking to use wireless payments the best bet is to avoid root. 
Upvoting for humor, and the practice of security through antiquity. I laughed, and that's a reason to upvote.
The USB cable here is at fault. It doesn't support that big of a current to fast charge. If you want fast charging, you'd have to get a power cable extension and then plus in an official Qualcomm 2.quick charger or a Samsung Adaptative Fast Charger with their included cable. The included cable will make it work for sure. It might work with other cables, but it's trial and error.
Just keep in mind that if you root, you can NEVER go back to using Samsung Pay. People have claimed that Android Pay can work with Xposed, but I always see people having issues.
im in the exact same boat as you right now. s4 going to either the s6 or note 5. im just super pissed they got rid of the battery and sd card.
Otterbox Defender series has a built in plastic little screen protector, although you're much better off throwing tempered glass over the screen. I got the Defender with a tempered glass and I popped out the plastic screen protector on the case since the tempered glass is protective enough. 
You don't... I've been on the same boat until my S3 died for good then I really needed something. If it makes you feel better, Bell now has Titanium Silver.
I would do this just so I could make the phone black. I hate this blue black shit. Its ugly as fuck and white phones are for women.Edit: 12 downvotes, I suppose that means there are now 12 men who read this and purchased the white version and are questioning their sexuality. 
Looks like I got about the same on 3d mark. Who knows, but I haven't had any issues with any actual 3d games.  
That's a shame. Do you know anyone with a Samsung fast charger to check the adapter? 
That's good to know. I know most iPhones would be toast with a normal drop on a tile or concrete floor. I've replaced many, many iPhone screens from that same scenario. 
It was a promotion they ran for signing up for Samsung pay and registering a card. Me and the wife got 3 out of it... kind of sad, she got 2, I only got one...
The grip is good.  I have no plans to switch to another case.  It really is slim so the already large phone isn't that much larger.  Has a nice lip around the edges to protect the screen when placed face down.  No issues with wireless charging, nfc, or Samsung pay.  I use the kickstand quite a bit too, just not for holding the phone.
How to: Setting -&gt About -&gt LegalTarget: Preferably, the unlocked version of Note 5Reason: I'm loooking to get a note 5 imported and to be used in japan but it is illegal to use phone without that mark. So  I was wondering which model has it. Also, there is no Note 5 available here so that is why I asked.Edit: Sorry i used Iphone as an example. It seems easier to understand!
Not an issue for me. Maybe we have different hand sizes?
I bet the charger was unplugged and he wanted to upsell you a case.
There are 2 lighting Launchers on Amazon. One is free and one is $1.79. Which is the one you've got?
huh - never seen this before. Not sure what the issue is. Are you seeing this way in the gallery app? Or only when you download, send to imgur? 
No warranty? Hmm I  guess you give that up for quick updates. 
Honestly, I don't know. I personally have the note 5 (obviously by my flair) so I never really looked into the nexus 6P in depth. I think the base differences boil down to user preference (google vs samsung/android vs touchwiz etc.)
how about the Note 4 charger? any idea?
Jokes on you.. I have unlimited data on Verizon :) 
Not Marshmallow. 
You mean you only have your screen on around 2.5 hours in 48 hours time? 
Same. People getting two and sometimes three free chargers, and my bank won't even let me get one. 
It's my first Note but I've owned several of the S line. I think like others said,  coming from a previous Note you should feel at home. Removable battery isn't an issue for me either because the fast charging helps a lot and it's got decent batter life anyway. I got the 64gb model and it's enough space for me.I previously used to root my phones but haven't felt the need to with this phone yet. That might have to do with the fact there's only TouchWiz based roms right now though.
Stealth Icon Pack, free in Play Store. 
That sucks because sometimes my phone thinks the S-pen is detaching causing it to vibrate and dims the screen for a split second. 
Same here. I didn't mistreat it. I may have done one or two 'clicky clicky' here and there while holding the stylus. But how can you not? If that's enough to make the stylus wear out in just a few months (I got mine at launch) making it get jammed in the phone. Or if the pen jams in the same fashion while not in the hole, replacing it isn't cheap. On top of the whole sticking it in backwards risking someone without the knowledge yanking it out and ruining the sensor. I think they may have really boned up the spen design this year.

Note 4, haven't run my Note 5 through the paces enough to say for certain yet, but this much I know so far: I'm not at all unhappy with the transition.  Battery life so far is at least even with my 4, and that's with the usual early days indexing, compiling, installing, updating still going on right now.  I have a feeling this will settle down soon enough.Smoothness and speed, definitely a noticeable difference between the 4 and 5.  Much smoother, much faster.Not missing the external SD card yet.  Not regretting my decision to continue pushing as much stuff as I can to the cloud.  This time around, especially, it made a huge difference because once I put my google accounts on, everything was back on my phone, not just my contacts and email.
Check out my thread on using PDP.  I routinely get between 6 and 7 hours screen on time.  https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxynote5/comments/3nrmk3/with_package_disabler_pro_i_got_7_hours_of_screen/http://imgur.com/a/SnIoL
Never had the spen just go out on its own, it fits in snugly for me.
I didn't get any updates, what can I do to push it to my phone? I have the developer mode on (to adjust animations) will that affect it? 
Weird they were very polite about taking an insane amount of money from me. I bounced the corner of my phone and had my s-pen pop out. After that it didn't quite work right so I ordered a new one and one for my Note 12015 while I was at it. Just In Case. 
I'm very much not the kind of person to change it up often and have used Nova for years. AL3 is pretty awesome I have to say and only because it's got the swipe action for widgets feature. Other than that I don't really care for it. I miss the folders and tabs in the drawer that Nova features. Performance wise they're the exact same. The only this AL3 has over Nova is the widgets thing. Other than that Nova is far better. 
I just had the exact same problem and fixed it. For some reason, DHCP renew constantly wakes up the device. Set it to a static IP and the alarms stop entirely. Yesterday, 76of my ~80alarms/wakelocks were because of that, and today I'm on track to get 7-8 of SoT. Edit- I couldn't find any decent way to reign in the wakelock without switching to a static IP. 
Because it's not really something that can be captured in a video like he is trying. [Open this picture ](https://sultanabdulhaseeb.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/black-grey-stripes-design-3.jpg?w=872&amph=576&ampcrop=1) and zoom in so the stripes take up your whole screen. Then scroll side to side. There will be a shadow that follows the black stripes (kinda blueish). That being said, it is a known issue with amoled screens. If I remember right it is because to get a better black the screen will turn off pixels rather than trying to replicate a black color. It give a better black, and saves energy, but it can create this ghosting effect under these conditions. 
I realize this is a bit dated, but I'm having a similar problem recently. Maps occasionally refuses to get a GPS lock, instead showing me approximate location which is useless for navigation. What's weird is that it was always really good when I first started using it. The problem only started happening for me about a month ago. And even then, it's not bad all the time. I haven't been able to figure anything out... I may give Waze a try just to see if the problem is GPS or if it's Maps... 
Normal.  Black means the screen turns that area off and the ghost will appear since the new bright area flashed on essentially. 
As far as I know the Verizon variant is not rootable.
Yeah it was 5.1.1 i figured it wasn't marshmallow but it would've been nice lol
Non-root solution to automatically dismiss the popup warning: https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxynote5/comments/3jhdll/touchwiz_tooltip_help/cuq1t5x
It's the POS USB cable that came with phone!!! It's happened to sooooo many of us already. Has been posted in this sub numerous times. Get a new USB cable. 
I want to know what's a good cable and what makes a good cable because I switched mine and it worked for about a week but now it's saying over 5 hours to charge from 20%.
My old phone was 16GB with a 32GB SD card and my Note 5 is 32GB with no expandable storage space . 
could you elaborate, I'm also on cricket ... but how would I get an att sim without getting an att plan or do you just pop one in (which I don't have one) and update over wifi?? I mean, none of this makes any sense to me, other att updates have pushed over cricket in the past. 
I saw a youtube video showing the Note 5 with 38% battery left and 8h55min left under Ultra Power Savings mode. That was really shocking. Does that mean a fully charged phone can only last 24h in Ultra Power Savings mode??? That is a massive fail...That may single handedly make me want to get the Note 4 :(
I was going to say, I've been using an AUKEY branded Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.charger and fast charge works all the time. 
&gt Also if they're into gaming maybe show off how well PPSSPP runs on with ROMs.Wait what? 
So I had to go to an AT&ampT store and one of the reps used a sim card from their display phones. As soon as he popped it in the update happened. I tried for days using my Cricket sim and it did not work. You need to have an active AT&ampT sim card in the phone to update. You can't use the one that came in the box. Or you could borrow one from a friend on AT&ampT. Another solution might be to go to a Best Buy with a Samsung Experience center inside. They should be able to update you. I went there first and they did an update but my Samsung Pay still wasn't working. Thinking back on it, I think that's because there had been multiple updates since the phone came out. So by the time I went to the AT&ampT store we did one more update and it worked.
I have my chase card tied to Android Pay right now. Samsung pay is better though in that I can use it at credit card readers that dont support NFC.
Best Buy is giving $10gift card this week (starting today) and they will apply it to the order making it $149.99 under contract. Sign me up!
I refer using the wireless fast charger. I've completely destroyed my S6 microUSB cable from using it while in bed. The fast charger is a charm though. Positioning correctly is a headache at first but when you get the hang of it it's easy. I got the charger with the phone so I don't know about unofficial chargers performances.
The Renaissance was the last time you could know everything, now we stand on others' shoulders. It's not disturbing that someone's educational needs exclude installing the OS.
That's not what [Samsung](http://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/wearables/gear-vr/) says:&gt* Compatible with??Galaxy Note5,??S6 edge+,??S6, and??S6 edge.
Do you have a link to it on amazon? The only crystal spigen I know is [this one](http://www.amazon.com/Protector-Spigen%C2%AE-Crystal-JAPANESE-Definition/dp/B010MWD59I) I ordered a few days ago, and it's a 3 pack of plastic protectors. It works fine for what it is, but I plan to switch out for a glass one later if anyone comes up with a better solution for the curved screen.
Man that's a major bummer. I hope att allows this to be included in the firmware update I'm really looking forward to it. 
I always told myself I'd never succumb to non-removable battery and no SD card. But here I am, in love and actually not bothered too much by either. 
I bought again from EBay and got the SM-N92W8. This is the Canadian version and it works great in the UK full 4G coverage for o2 UK. I bought it from save-max
Have you received it yet? Was a toss up between this and the Nexus 6P but I really wanted the stylus and the video recording for the 6P worries me - so anything sub ??50is ideal for me as the 6P is around that price.
Yeah, the one I want is much more accurate with S-pen writing
Thanks..and what's the widget that's the thin line with stats?
I'll record what I'm talking about. 
Check out the smart lock under Secure Lock Settings. Mine reverts to the swipe unlock when I'm in a trusted place (home) or when I'm wearing a trusted device (smart watch). 
The reason for the bump is to protect the camera. It should be fine as is.
You can get a 3rd party fast wireless charger for $35 off Amazon, by Choetech.  From what I hear, they're a pretty reliable brand, and I'm planning to pick one up myself.  I've been using the old Nokia wireless chargers (I have 8 of them), but they only charge at a fraction of what the newer chargers do, so it's reallllllllllly slow.That being said, I just got my Note sunday, threw Darthstalker's rom on it and Nova, and it's working great.  I was honestly expecting to like it a lot less than I do, just because of my experiences with Samsung, Touchwiz and the S6.
I wouldn't have known it at the time, but now I recognize the tones that play on the pad when he's pressing it are the notes from that infamous [Close Encounters scene.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4PYI6TzqYk) 
Seriously what's up with the Sprint hate?  Not everyone has bad service with Sprint.  Where I live, I get BETTER speeds and service with Sprint (I have both T-Mo and Sprint).  In fact, I get better coverage on average with Sprint than with T-Mo, and I live in an urban area (SF Bay Area).  Ever try driving down I-5 between SF and LA?  T-Mo = Zero coverage Sprint = at least I can make a phone call and text.  Wish you don't have a car break down and need to make a phone call on I-5 if you have T-Mo.
There is samsung customer care around, but again, I have went to their service before, never got phone back before 4 weeks... and you know, staying 4 weeks without phone is pretty hard.. I could live with half wifi speed, its just I don't know if it would get worse later. Thanks for suggestions, at least someone noticed my problem .Oh and btw, does flashing stock firmware through odin trip knox warranty? 
It's the regular wireless charger, not fast charger. Though, I knew that going into it. 
Any of the UAG cases, love the protection without being bulky and the looks are a plus.
Might as well stock up now, so that way you are never without an spen.
Carriers get to decide what features are on the phones because they are paying for them. The carriers buy millions of phones from the manufacturers in bulk and resell them to you. Since they are the original buyer, they get to customize the phones to their liking. Look at it like this...if you were to buy one of the new nexus phones straight from Google, you get to pick certain options like color and storage space.  Now say you didn't use the phone and instead you turned around and resold it new in the box to someone else. If that person buys the phone from you, they are also buying into whatever options you chose whenever you originally purchased the phone. Because the carriers are buying  so many phones and because the carriers can chose what phones  can and can't be activated ln their networks, they are in a position of power and can customize many aspects of the phone that an ordinary user cannot.Apple gets away with less meddling because it is easier for them to sell directly to consumers than it is for android manufacturers - so carriers lose leverage there. Plus there are several Android manufacturers who must compete with each other for carrier sales so they wind up making more concessions to get to the carriers lineups. There is only one Apple that is hugely popular with consumers so Apple has more negotiating power to get what they want.
My friend did. Costly mistake. You know what's the shitty thing? The glass on the front was an easy fix before. All you needed was a screwdriver and a blowdryer and you could replace the glass on any Galaxy in less than 1minutes. Now, the glass and LCD are fused together so that you are forced to drop $20on a display assembly. It cost less for him to ship it to Samsung and have them do it over buying the part and doing it himself. It really sucks. 
I love this phone. I'm coming from a Note 4 and the speed and quality of this phone blow the Note 4 away.  This is the first phone I've ever been fully satisfied with. The Note 4 was perfect, minus the lag, but no more!  Also, I'm not one of those no removable battery, no microSD slot, no sale  weirdos.
I edited my comment. NO Samsung Pay on unlocked or international variants. 
Hmmm, tried that, I'm still getting Can't open the microphone errors pretty often when I try to activate the command prompt from the off screen. Do you use this app with the Note 5 currently? And it works?
They will but they will require you send back your whole charger and they send you a new one. Which sucks because then you're out a charger for how ever long they take. 
I just got mine 2 days ago. First Android phone. Using reddit is fun and can't for the life of me figure out how to submit a post through the app. Anyway, I used the .xml file from the xda forum that pops up here a lot. Took 1 minute, and then I scrolled through and turned off AT&ampT apps, cause original guy was on t-mobile.  Nothing seems to be impaired. Pretty happy with battery life. SoT has been reasonable, but I stream a lot of spotify.
Is there any way to force my phone to find the update? Using the N920C model unlocked. Checking for software update with no luck
I got a black wall charger and USB cable in the box.
It's under applications in applications manager , it will never be in app drawer it's not an app  it's a service 
Hey. I disabled FB and messenger. Cleared data and cache as well. Then I went to the play store and enabled it from there. It seems to work. Now my FB actually notifies me of updates. 
Nope. I get error messages so I am sure. Everything worked this morning and then at about 9:3it didn't. The only video I've seen since is from Popcorn Time.
I like material dark but I actually try quite a few. I'm using Deep Blue now and like it quite a bit. 
I just got my note 5 a few days ago and WOW I'm so pleasantly surprised at the battery life. I came from the s6 which sucked. I saw some comments online saying that note 5 battery life sucked but idk what they're talking about. So this battery optimization thing was just released? I noticed it in the battery settings but I thought it was an early android 6.feature
if they were smart, they'd quickly develop a simple tool to get the pen out and sell it for $1on their store.
Glass. 
Does this have any effect on your WiFi connection? 
Thanks so much cause I'm not a huge fan of the plain glass
You'd want to buy a Tmobile model and ask them to sim unlock it. 
Edit: I agree with TheCodifier. Keeping it to ON must save more battery, since then the digitizer isn't constantly active, but only when it detects the pen has been detached.
that's clear, I am not an idiot, lol.the Note 3 cable uses a special/wide USB 3 connector pictured [here](http://i-cdn.phonearena.com/images/articles/99114-image/The-new-Micro-USB-3.0-connector.jpg)that's why I mentioned having to use the Note 5 cable.The charger itself is also rated 2A and offers a quick charge feature.I am just wondering if it's the same as for the Note 5, and hoping to find someone that upgraded and tried it.
I tried NOVA 3 because it was listed as a top game for the moga controllers. The controller pairs fine, and I can navigate the home screen with it. Maybe it is must that specific game. I am trying to download dead trigger 2 right now. Gonna give that a shot =)
here is my impressions for out of the box phone:1. Amazing to hold and feel2. Amazing speed with no lag3. good battery life (around 4 screen on time, but gets through full day)4. charge speed is soooo quick.5. Touchwiz is great now.6. awesome camera---after rooting and getting a good ROM and kernal:  1. faster with much less bloatware  2. battery can go to 6-7 screen on time.  3. RAM management fix easily (not like i noticed it before)  4. xposed framework.  much more things.  if you are looking into CM/AOSP ROMs, dont expect much development into having a stable version or even a beta one (yet at least) so keep in mind you may be stuck with touchwiz, which will get marshmallow in December. 
Software, stereo speakers, no branding on front, amoled, aluminium build, 810.It's mainly the software part
Speaking on behalf of somebody who has had both devices, the Note 5 trumps the performance and battery life of the S6.  Considering they're based on the same Exynos SoC, I didn't believe it until I got to play with the S6 after buying my Note 5.  I guess that extra 1GB of RAM really does matter when TouchWiz is part of the equation.
Hey, can you post your wallpaper? I like it a lot. Thanks!
There's a trick people use with a straw cut in half long ways. I'm sure you can find a video of it on YouTube
This is on WiFi. Based solely on the type of WiFi standard the phone supports. Quite a few phones can achieve WiFi speeds like this... 
Coming from a nexus 6 on marshmallow, I definitely notice stuttering.  Google keyboard swiping isn't as smooth, there's some jank on the home screen using nova...  But overall, I haven't had very many speed complaints with mine.  It just kinda feels like a bull in a china closet, all power but no delicacy.  Still love it though.
How to I do that through smart switch?? I just downloaded it and don't know how to update there.
The bonuses are deeper blacks than pretty much any screen, better battery life, and more precise color (read the Note 5 screen reviews).  Most people want AMOLED - ie see excitement from the Nexus 6p people when they found out it was Samsung panel.
Thanks! It actually turned out that I had to first turn on NFC, switch to the Samsung Pay app from Android Pay, which then allowed me to access the menu for Samsung Pay, to then go to the settings and turn off Simple Pay.Otherwise known as a bug.
I normally pay used prices a couple of months after a phone has been out but I lucked into mine for $200. I worked at a cell phone store that let us buy returned phones for the price the customer paid since that's all they had invested in it.The truth is that I'd still pay close to full retail if I had to. Anything $72or less saves me money vs subsidy/installments during the life cycle of my device (two years). 
Beats our beaches. Although I still love our coastline on the sound. 
I own both the Note 4 and Note 5.  Performance wise, you won't notice any difference day to day.  Just slightly higher framerates on 3D games and app switching and startup is a hair faster.  That's about it.  However, the Note 5's camera is simply stunning...if you know photography.  The RAW, manual controls, adjustable color profiles, free Lightroom for DNG files, it makes UP for all of it's shortcomings if you really have the knowledge to get so much more out of manual camera and RAW files.Other Note 5 things I like:Fast Wireless Charging actually works really well with a Fast Wireless Charger.Gear VR is cheaper and better for the Note 5.  Probably performs about the same with the same amount of pixelation.Note 4 advantages:MHL/Smart Dock works with Note 4, not Note 5Spare batteries in your pocket charging on a external charger is better than any fast charging/wireless charging solution.SD card...it's just nice to have it always there so you never have to worry about recording too much 4K video, or having a lot of movies/tv shows on the go for a trip.  64GB device with no SD card is already proving to be a tight fit on the Note 5 due to all the Gear VR apps and 360/3D media I'm trying.  I wish I had a micro SD card slot.
As someone who's a massive OneNote geek (using it on my surface pro 3, note 5 and moto360), this is fucking epic. Microsoft have a bit of work to  do to catch up. I'd always thought s-note was a bodgy app until now.
While I am sure you would have taken steps to make things better, have you tried turning Wifi's Always on Scanning setting and GPS, off? 
Once Knox is tripped, you do not have Samsung pay.Edit becsusd i cant read. It you use system less root, it should work. 
Depends on your brightness and what is actually on the screen
Sadly, possibly. This is the most detailed thread about it I could find, but there are other threads on AC, XDA, Reddit... http://forums.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-note-5/570201-note-5-bluetooth-issue.htmlFor the longest time I assumed it was an issue either with my speaker or a combination of the phone and the speaker since the speaker worked fine with my Moto X. Then I got a Fitbit and it would not connect for the life of it unless I put the phone on top of the damn thing. Then I started to do more research. Previously, I didn't think it was a bluetooth issue since my car bluetooth was always fine. But wifi is never connected in the car. I turned off wifi, connected to my bluetooth speaker and got about 1ft of range. Not great, but workable at least. Try to turn off WiFi and see if the connection gets any better. Seems like most people need to return the phone for any success. No software fixes work for most people, including a factory reset, all of which I've tried.
That's crazy man I never get that good of battery life I use both of those apps as well.

When my old M7 started doing this, the battery inflated and lifted the screen. Be very careful.
None of my apps use up much of the battery, i usually use them so little that they don't even appear on my usage.
You mean SAMSUNG PAY right? Not the android pay? Or am I missing something here?
Yup, I had it on my Australian Note 4 (N910G), but it's not on my Australian Note 5 (N920I). 
I would bet my last dollar that IF there is a protector it will be like the one that was over my flash, it will have a small grab feel ans be soft enough to feel tacy if you press it with a finger nail. 
I had one on my Note 5 for about 15 minutes. HORRIBLE. I couldn't depress buttons and my S-Pen was blocked. I returned it.
I had exactly the same issue with an S6 edge recently. Was fine for a few weeks then started restarting itself randomly several times a day. Spoke to Samsung support here in the UK and they advised it was likely a faulty logic board that would need to be repaired.Unfortunately it turns out the handset I bought on Amazon was somehow a non-EU device that isn't covered under warranty here, so Samsung UK wouldn't touch it. I had to get a refund from Amazon instead. 
I have rooted every smart phone I have ever had... until this one. Samsung pay is too awesome.  The only thing I miss is adaway. 
My Samsung pay one was accepted  today but the galaxy gifts one is still pending 
Does easyhome drain the battery more than the usual button press? 
The supplied charger that came with my phone doesn't always fast charge my phone. Often I have to unplug it then plug it back in the phone for it to fast charge.
Nice..... I've never actually tried flat style bars, any bugs on TouchWiz? 
&gtI had one on my Note 5 for about 15 minutes. HORRIBLE. I couldn't depress buttons and my S-Pen was blocked. I returned it.My only guess is you found one for the wrong phone? Tech 21 tactical.
I really can't say.  99% of the time my phone has been great.  However the other night I randomly got severe battery drain from android system which took out about 25% of battery in 2 hours while idling.
I'm curious if flashing the stock ROM would give Android Pay the ability to add cards again.I'm getting my Discover card soon, so I'll test when I get that (currently have no cards that'll work with Android Pay).
Not sure if it's a feature or a bug, but notification sounds will play through the speaker, even with headphones plugged in 
Post your battery statistics from GSAM or another battery monitoring app and let everyone take a look at it.Who is your carrier?  Are you doing all of the stuff you describe via a weak connection, or 4G?  Have you disabled bloatware?   Honestly I had over 6 hours screen on time before doing anything to the phone but these are things I know have caused others problems from reading similar threads.
There are a couple of things you can do and most probably you'll notice the difference right away. 1. Turn Wifi Scanning to off, that way it won't be searching for Wifi when the Wifi is in fact off. (Settings &gt Wifi &gt Press the overflow button for options)- Won't hamper any of the functionality you expect from a TouchWiz device. 2. Turn off the GPS + Disable and Delete the Location History (from Google Settings &gt Location). Having a darker theme definitely helps but that might not be as noticeable. Another thing you can do, and I believe should try is getting Package Disabler Pro and only disable the apps that you don't use. I for example don't use Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Papergarden, Knox so I selectively disabled some of that stuff - it definitely helps. Power charging your phone, that is draining it till the phone shuts down and then charging it up to 10while turned off also helps, in fact this is what I do when I get a new phone. Some days I use my phone pretty extensively, some days I use it to read, be on reddit and for playing games and stuff. My SoT varies from 5 hours (45% battery left) to 6 hours (30% battery left). This is aside from 1 to 2 hour long calls that I do almost daily. 
Edit: I'd like to clarify that I've been Binge Watching on Netflix for about 6 hours
Do you have any pics of the bumper with your dBrand skin? I'm curious to see how it looks!
Thanks for the help. Unfortunately I tried this as well and it hasn't fixed the issue. After doing some research it is related to Samsung VR installing itself on my phone. Seems like alot of other Samsung phones are experiencing the same issue and many people had to get a refurb phone from Samsung. I sent my phone to Samsung last week and they informed me that one of the liquid damage indicators had changed colors so they will not look into the issue. Even though I know this was not causing the issue they are firm about rendering the phone beyond repair.As of now it seems like a few people suggested installing 5.0.1 or using Package Disabler Pro to get rid of Samsung VR apps.For anyone having similar problems here are links to other people experiencing the same issue:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtdahXCetu4http://forums.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-note-4/543502-gear-vr-setup-process-starts-itself.html
Does this happen with finger touch, stylus or both? This will tell you if it's a stylus or screen problem. If you turn off your screen and then remove the stylus and draw in that area, do you still have the problem? How much of the screen is affected by the problem? This will give you an idea of how much of the screen is affected and if the problem is app specific.Trying these tests will help tech support get closer to a solution. My guess is that there is a new or refurbished phone in your future...
I definitely agree!  Coming from an iPhone 6s Plus and the one thing that frustrates me with this phone, is the battery.
When I swapped from AT&ampT in 2012 they told me I wouldn't get LTE speeds if I used my AT&ampT phone. Not sure if that has changed. For me though, I was still on a regular Galaxy S so I decided to upgrade anyway. 
I've received absolutely nothing. I don't think I can do gifts of the season cause I think that's only if you buy your phone outright. But I signed up for $10samsung.com gift card and $5best buy card for using samsung pay. I signed up two weeks ago and absolutely nothing. Just a conformation number.
Actually I don't have a note, I went with the 6p since I had to pay out of pocket, but I believe the note should be getting marshmallow pretty soon! And the 6.01 update comes with the updated emojis! Including the middle finger!
Could try downloading another camera app.  I did a quick search on the store and found this camera with 72 effects. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=imagic.mobile.instant.camera
I don't root my phones well I have a At&ampt variant so I can't anyway. I believe only T-Mo, Sprint, and unlocked phones can. And rooting will most likely set off the Knox counter. If you want to use Samsung pay that it will not work with root. And since Knox will be tripped and you can't reset the counter. You'll never be able to use Samsung pay once Knox is tripped. Though without root Package Disabler pro will literally be your bestest of best friends! Disable all the sprint apps in your case and Samsung stuff you don't need. And Material Dark theme for a stock experience. Or maybe even Nova Launcher perhaps.As far as battery life. My usage being texting, youtube, relay (reddit client), google plus, web browsing, google play music for a hour or two, and half hour total of phone calls. Bluetooth always on connected to my pebble and Power saver on. The highest SOT I've gotten is 6hr 47min on wifi. But I average 5-5 1/2 hours occasionally 6 hrs of SOT on LTE.
I'll totally take you up on that. Thanks for all the info. I'll start looking it over soon and probably dive in after Christmas once I get a chance to slow down and dedicate some time to it. In the meantime you've given me a lot of homework I need to study before I leap. Thanks again for everything. You're on my awesome list. It's like a standard sh*tlist but opposite. :D
S-Note would require you to export the notes, its ok to use with s-pen, i can never write that much on it,mainly emails and reminders one Note has much more, you can sign into the microsoft account and sync your files. Not sure about exporting to one Note though, should be possible.
Android device manager did find my device but it doesn't have an unlock function. I tried resetting my Google password but Samsung told me it will take 72 hours until the phone will accept the new password.Find my mobile through Samsung for some reason will not find my device
Someone else mentioned this and I want to make sure you get it, if you're on Verizon go to settings and turn on Advanced Calling. Once it's active and on you'll have simultaneous voice and data no problem. Enjoy!
In that case, I apologize for going outside of the norm that you are used to, and fuck you for thanking me, you're wrong! I am extremely picky when it comes to screen protectors and getting air bubbles/dust under them. With the plastic ones it is damn near impossible to get everything out, however with glass they lay on MUCH easier and with very little to no air bubbles. My process is to either go right after someone has taken a hot shower or run the shower on lava hot for 1minutes to steam up the bathroom real good, this removes most of the floating dust that tends to land on your screen during application. I also always keep a hair dryer next to me for a couple reasons: to blow the screen off just before applying the protector as well as putting heat to the adhesive just after application to help the seal. If you are as nit picky as I am you can use tape to act as a hinge for the top of the protector. I line everything up just how I want it and put tape across the top of the protector, wrapping around the back of the phone so it can't move before peeling the plastic layer off and sticking it down. With a glass protector there really is no rolling it on, its more so just lay it down and use firm pressure to work the bubbles out. Apply some heat with the hair dryer at the same time and I have never had one that ends up with any air at all. (glass that is, the plastic ones are terrible and I used to blow through 3 of them until I got one good enough to leave on)
Reminds me of the goonies art work cover for the movie. Thanks alot, it looks amazing! 
Halo effect?I googled it. My screen protector has never done that. Weird
I tend to use most of my phones caseless.  Usually I'll end up buying one or two, like with my N6 I had a slim armor and a minimal shell case.  If we're going out and I know I'll let my 5yo play with my phone, I'll put one on, usually the tougher of the two.  I'll likely do the same with my Note, but for now it's nekkid.
#8 - Enjoy your phone... I get you want battery life but after you're done gimping the phone for it there's not much left to enjoy.
I have a Gear S, Gear S2, and G Watch R.  My goto is the G Watch R.  I'm not really impressed with the Gear S2 as others seem to be.  And I've debated getting rid of the Gear S.  The only reason I hold on to it is it's stand alone capability.  I think most of the disappointment with the Gears is the lack of watch faces available.  After all there are many more available on android wear, then in the Samsung store.  And I love the Krona Sunlight face, but am using one called Nighthawk right now for constant on. And I haven't had any burn in, or serious battery issues with it.
It's the serial that KIES needs. An update, we got his phone working again. 
Ah, can I set it to unlock when I press the hardware button?
just get the note 4. It will pretty much be the note 5 when marshmallow comes out but with a removable battery, microsd card, and a worse fingerprint scanner.
Maybe it's just the amount of apps you have? Some can drain a pretty lot of battery
What type of content do you want full screen?  
yes, but then I cant put anything on that screen. Am I missing something. I want to be able to swipe left for my contact shortcuts. I went back to touchwiz from nova just to test it out and I can't seem to do that anymore.
Close all is at the bottom, but in the center, and IIRC the hitbox is not triggered by the sides. On Lollipop, the close all button has given me quite the headache, so I get what you are coming from.I am the author by the way, so let me know if you have any questions. I reverted back to COJ5 as that has amazing battery life, but I remember plenty about MM.
Nope, I don't even think you hear ads when using their version of Pandora,  though I'm not certain about that. No ads among personally added content though. Also a note,  they scan your music and then if they already have a copy in their library they just link that to your account instead,  so if you have some files that are of poor quality once uploaded if they have the same song you'll get the best quality version. 
I just did it. Looks like a little bit of a wait. I'll update this post if something changes. Update. (12/13) I received my promo code in email today. Still have to wait till the 15th to use it.
Bad news on my one. It doesn't actually fit on the bottom edge correctly. It still shows some of the silver trim because it bends down near the charging port.
Hey /u/ahhhhWHOA!Sorry about the delay in responding... been a crazy weak gearing up for Black Friday and we weren't on Reddit much.Obviously we'll get a replacement sent out free of charge, what you received is a clearly defective product. Took a look at the photo and the bottom of the skin seems to have gotten warped somehow. Did you notice a similar warping on the clear packaging it came in? We've seen this happen a few times before. We aren't sure exactly what causes it, but speculate that it may be the result of high speed mail sorting machinery that likely gets pretty hot running over the envelope and warping the vinyl.In any event, if you sent an email, you should have already gotten a reply about your replacement being shipped. If you haven't gotten a reply yet, just post up your Order # and we'll get a response your way in a few minutes.
Nova Launcher and keeping the beautiful stock Android look. http://imgur.com/dYRzWtY
I am running pvz just fine. Never had a hiccup on it. Is all your software up to date? 
Oh I'm 100% convinced it's AT&ampT's dicking with the ROM that causes the problems.When the phone first got to me it was like yours. ATT did a security update or something and totally broke the phone. One of the strongest cases for having a Nexus or an iPhone or other unlocked non-carrier-fu**ed with device. Whatever condition you get it in it will generally stay in since only the manufacturer touches the OS. 
More details would be great! I've been trying to get more acquainted with LL, but there seems to be a pretty steep learning curve.EDIT: I'm also unable to figure out how you got the rest of the app drawer to be completely transparent.
Got an update on Sunday and since then Play Services, Android OS and Android System have been chewing battery. Media Server has been right up there too. I wiped my cache today to see if that might help, but any other ideas are much appreciated!
I snatched mine up yesterday. Was between n5 and 6p, at this price I couldn't resist ( I was up for a 2 year upgrade and I'm pretty happy with my carrier) .FYI, I went into store and tried to upgrade but Sprint would not allow bb to process my purchase because for some reason, it could not process it with my current plan (I'm on a grandfathered plan). So after trial and error and a little bit of embarrassment, I left the store. Called Sprint, they were no help at all . what I ended up doing is buying on line (best buy site)and picked up at the store. Beautiful phone,  just waiting on a case.
Long press the screen, uncheck the flip board. 
Since I like a watch to have a battery that lasts at least (or more than) one day, I'll be endorsing the Pebble Time.Seriously, to me, the Pebble is what a smart watch needs to be. I leave fitness tracking to the phone. I get all my notifications and can act on them with buttons and voice commands. Battery lasts 7+ days. Always-on screen that's visible in sunlight. Not overly huge.I had the original Moto 360, and it did not take me long to hate it and return it for a Pebble.
Something from the s5 that is lacking in the s6 and note 5 as well.  Wonder if it's a hardware or software thing 
Same problem with upper volume button. It's like there is maple syrup stuck there. Maybe they had a bad run of buttons.
I went ahead and rooted after Capital One pretty much said fuck you to Samsung Pay. Samsung warranty is void but that doesn't mean I don't have carrier warranty. Carriers never check and end up taking apart the phone anyway. 
Measures % of your red blood cells that are saturated with oxygen, meaning how much oxygen is getting carried in blood. For regular people its nifty but not useful. For people with respiratory problems potentially useful as a basic monitor. No idea about accuracy. Readings in hospitals vary some if hands are cold, not good placement on sensor, fat fingers, skinny fingers. So take with grain of salt but you wanna be 94-100% 
Do you know if this works for sound files? I have a bunch of homemade ring tones that I would love to have not player when I'm listening to music on shuffle.
Unplug and replug in your router. How many devices do you have connected to it? Is it only a certain wifi where you've noticed the problem?
Get yourself a tablet then. Crazy talk.
Go to Smart Manager and click on RAM.I have 80% used. Hasn't been a problem.
I have been off charger for 3 days and 9 hours (not kidding but I haven't used the phone much since it's my backup phone) and still at 26% Trying to hit 4+ days just for the bragging rights
Haha don't worry about it. You got some interesting images! The tripod idea is totally a great one though! If you keep the phone still with those long exposures it will capture some stuff that's even cooler! 
I would think it should be fine. I did the same thing as I didn't like the tempered glass look on this beautiful phone.  At the same time I don't think adding it again does any real harm.  PS- when applying any cleaner for screens you generally apply it to the pad or cloth and then rub it on the phone. That's why that alcohol pad should have not done damage but I can't be certain without seeing it. 
What your most likely hearing is the ois system on the camera. 
Something wrong with either the charger or cable.  Try mixing and matching those before blaming the battery.  That just looks like you're on a slow-charging setup, like plugging into a laptop.
I'll try to find the brand later, but here's a picture of it. http://imgur.com/zRI0SF4 Upon closer inspection, it does seem to have a slight ring around the edge. 
Im having a similar issue, but its only the top left corner of the screen. Basically the place where on chrome you hit to make a new tab. It seems to be a software issue though as when I turn the phone sideways, changing the screen from portrait to landscape, the, new, top left continues to be unresponsive.
Yes, it probably uses the same coils as the charger for MST.
Anyone find a fix for this? I'm still getting it at least once every couple days. I've found that toggling airplane mode usually fixes it. Something else was odd when it happened just now. I found I could load YouTube pages on chrome, but no other sites would work. 
Nah, unfortunately you can't choose a color, but a free charger is better than no charger I guess
Yeah your right the only real reason I have seen is viper4android and titanium backup this is the first time I'm not itching to put a custom rom on. I actually love the phone the way it's running but I still want my root features. 
Totally happy with the note 5. stick your gut, it'll say Note 5 and  tacos, trust me! The G4 looks nice but the screen doesn't compare to the note's.  I find myself using the Spen more and more. It's really handy. 
Root, and custom rom or xposedI'd guess Dr Ketan rom, I have the same centre clock and battery. 
I saw you use the original charger. Do you use the original cable as well? 
See if your TV has a remote control via wifi, most tv's made in the past 18mo or so should have it, and it's much faster. But yea sucks in general =/
Just used it! Strangely the NFC payment failed, but the MST payment worked.
[This one in black](http://www.amazon.com/Caseology%C2%AE-Wavelength-Textured-Pattern-Samsung/dp/B011AO16JS/ref=sr_1_7?s=wireless&ampie=UTF8&ampqid=1449032778&ampsr=1-7&ampkeywords=Caseology+note+5).Completely recommend it. Very thin and light with a *fantastic* grip. I have, however, been looking at the new Zerolemon battery case. I loved the one for my S3 but I'll wait for a review or something. I've never used one of these before. It's usually just a bigger battery. As for the Caseology case, give it a shot. You won't be disappointed. 
No, Samsung Pay is designed to work with chip cards. In fact it's much faster than waiting ten seconds for a chip card to authorize. I use it with my chipped cards at places that require card insertion all the time.
Apparently,  you have to install in an unusual way. Somewhere there is a video for this. YouTube it, maybe.
faster to launch, faster shutter speed, manual controls, better flash, better pics in general, better ffc and has a setting to reshape the odd angles of your face on the front camera
The fact that most of the world's money is online is a problem for me. If everybody went to the bank asking for their money, the banks would shut down because that much money doesn't exist. I collect silver/gold/cash for this very reason. I only use my cards for purchases I can't use cash for. I distrust bitcoin because too much hacking has been going on lately with everybody else. It's only a matter of time until cryptocurrency gets hit too.
I'll check when I get home and maybe try changing it to 5 Ghz. I've used the WiFi analyser to check if the channel was crowded but mine was the only network using it that got picked up.
I'm from South Africa so I likely won't be getting Samsung pay with this round of phones, if ever. I am uncertain how to tell what model ours would be most similar to so I guess that's a problem I'll have to face when I get the device. Are there any other downsides to tripping knox? I've heard it's quite slippery a few times now. Going to have to get one in my hands to really feel it though. Thanks for the reply!
Probably won't answer your question but here is some information..&gtDepending on how your carriers network is structured, different settings are mandatory. The rest can be slightly altered to change some of the parameters, but for most of us we will need to use the exact settings provided by our carrier.&gtThe good news is that most of the time, your phone already has these settings in the system files, and can fill in the APN information automatically when it connects. Small changes are often sent via SMS once the core connection is made. For example ??inserting a Cricket SIM card will cause your phone to fill in the APN settings for a standard AT&ampT-based pre-paid carrier. Once that's done, you'll get a text with a download for better settings that optimize your connection. This sounds like a lot of work, and it is. But automated ways of entering settings and updating them mean less support calls.&gtBut not every APN will fill in by itself on all phones. Sometimes, you'll have have to dig in an do it yourself.
Install tasker. Long press home button should bring up the option of google now or tasker (or whatever else you have installed). Select the tasker action you want. It's not in the settings menu. Clear your defaults if it doesn't work? 
Looks to me as if I will end up having to replace the camera completely. I was taking test shots and the camera seems to not adjust its focus. So there is a depth range where the shots taken are great but I cannot get the phone to focus on anything close or further away.This is a bummer.
I use Lecture Notes, personally. More customization options than S-Note. I use Dropsync to sync my notes across devices. Works like a charm.
I tried about 4 different brands of tempered glass protectors. TechMatte was the only one I was happy with and didn't have a halo effect.
Spigen ultra hybrid crystal adds virtually no weight or thickness, but has cushioned corners, protects the screen when face down and the camera when on back.
anyone know what not to do to trip knox ? i have a south african version. dont know exactly what crap they installed on this one so suppose its an international version
Then I would suggest you go to AT&ampT and ask them for a replacement or just contact samsung directly. Show them that it takes over 6 hours to charge etc. I'm sure they will either replace it or help you fix the issue. 
I'm to the point i don't believe people when they claim 8 hours sot. My note 5 battery life sucks even with package disabler etc. My nexus 5 battery life was literally the same just without fast charging
 I just got it a few days ago.  It's easily the best smart phone I've had.  Bad thing?  I've noticed a stutter or two while doing stuff.  I'm a little surprised to find slow down, but it hasn't happened at moments that bother me (yes, I know Touch Wiz has a reputation). 
&gt BodyguardzHoly crap. 45 bucks for a screen protector. It looks good, but that's a lot. To each his own though...Oh, I see cheaper versions as low as 2bucks.
It exists for sure. I wouldn't even stock Note 4/5 glass screen protectors in my store because I got so many of them returned. Otterbox won't even take the Alpha ones back as a return under their lifetime warrenty even though it's a manufacturing defect.On the other hand, there are better suited glass screen protectors out there for the Note series and other curved glass screens that will contour to the edges. I'm just not sure of any off of the top of my head and I'm too busy watching Varsity Blues on my other monitor to look it up. 
It comes with the Facebook app?! That's fucked up considering the atrocious privacy invasions associated with that app.
That's exactly my thought. Plus, I don't want to trip Knox as I am able to use Samsung Pay with my AMEX cards.
You can do as fluffy bro said. You could also us smart select with your pen. Both should work but fluffy bro's method is probably the preffered.
Notice how the buttons are flipped but the letters aren't.
A lot of people seem confused as to how smart unlock works. When smart unlock is active you don't need to scan your finger at all. Just swipe the screen anywhere except the padlock and it'll take you to your home screen. When you swipe the padlock you're actually locking the phone so that it then requires your fingerprint to unlock. 
Based on mine, you have a pretty magical Note. I only ever use relay for reddit, a tiny bit of Facebook, chrome and whatsapp on almost minimum brightness, and I get an absolute maximum of 5 hours SOT. Even after applying numerous tips read on here. 
That's weird about saving images.  I'm able to do it on Google Chrome in mobile mode. Long tap on image and the pop-up comes up giving me the option to save.OK I see what the problem is.  If you do the image search using the Google Search app(widget) you don't get that option.Instead, open up the Chrome browser app and do the search in there instead.  It seems when you use the Google Search widget to search, it doesn't give the pop-up option.
I appreciate the advice, but unfortunately it doesn't work.  =/   Samsung phone are weird. My XPeria didn't interrupt my music. Also odd that when using bluetooth and receiving messages, it adds an extra chime, even when all notifications are muted. Tested on Galaxy S3, S5, and Note 5, so I know it's not just my stereo. 
The ones without names are folders. The gmail app and messaging app are stand alone icons. I haven't really looked into removing the names yet. I'm sure nova launcher probably gives me the option. The widget is UCCW. And the skin is Chevelle for UCCW 
Currently 45% battery with 2.5hours screen on time. Took it off charger around 1last night, so biggest battery drain is marked as cell standby 
Got the same email from them.  At this point I don't even care lol.
Modern phone batteries should be charged as often as possible. Running them all the way down is bad for them in the long run. Fast charging is something you should disable unless you absolutely need it - Coming from a Note 4 with a removable battery, I noticed a stark difference between the life of the batteries that I routinely fast charged vs the ones I didn't over the course of a year.
First of all congrats on your new phone! This thing is feature loaded! OK starting off:1) Visit the Galaxy appstore and check out the galaxy gifts which are paid apps gone free exclusively for Samsung device owners.2) Get a case because this thing is slippery! Check out the spigen cases on Amazon. Also get a tempered glass screen protector.3) Visit the Playstore and get Nova Launcher Prime (paid version). Its lightweight and feature rich does wonders on your device.4) Get a wireless fast charger. This is so convenient, believe me.5) Check out Package Disabled  Pro (Samsung) in the playstore. This app let's you disable bloat bloatware without root.6) Check out YouTube videos about tips and tricks like someone suggested here.7) Last but not least, don't stop fiddling with your device. Know the ins and outs and ultimately have fun!
Yeaaaaaa...we're gonna need way more i nfo than Samsung has an override...I'm on Verizon and have been using wireless fast charge daily no problems yet...
Try out textra too. Lots of customization and you can enable iOS emojis. I think you have to sideboard the emoji APK though since they got in trouble with Apple. If you don't want to do that you can just installs their twitter emoji addon from the play store. 
I think I would be a bit disappointed with the battery life. I currently use a Lumia 152and it gets two days of regular use from me on a single charge. I'll ask my friend about her battery life. 
I have the Spigen Neo Hybrid Crystal - I have dropped my phone about five times now - twice on the sidewalk, once in the street, twice on hardwood floors.  The bumper has some scratches, but the phone is perfectly fine.  One drop was on the upper right corner, the same type of drop that led to me breaking my S3 and S4.   All these drops were from ~4' or so. Note - the S-Pen unclicks itself loose after every drop, and once went flying about 4 feet from the drop site - so be mindful if you drop it!
Don't get me wrong. I've rooted every single other android phone that I've had. Usually I wait a little bit to get a feel of the phone first. I'm all down to root  and put a custom rom on there. This phone is just so fast and great out of the box that I haven't felt the need to do it just yet.
What carrier are you with?I'm with Telus (Canadian company), and I struggle to get more than 4H SoT. This is with a dark themed background, google locations history turned off, and 8things disabled w/ package disabler pro.I'm not sure if carriers have anything to do with battery life besides a little bit of bloatware? But charging times are fast, i'd just like it if I would be able to get more consistent and better battery life
Flatty icon pack on go launcher 
Is this why my connection to a brand new Bluetooth speaker sucked so bad? 
I'm pretty sure the swipe to unlock is for when you are connected to a Bluetooth device. This has been my experience so far, anyway. 
Download this and this will show you if you have stuck or dead pixels. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.codefortravel.amoled_screen_burn_in
Google Now Launcher. It's clean and having the cards pane is a real help. It's also lag free even if you have a ton of widgets set up on it. Only drawback to it is the sorta backwards method to navigate across multiple homescreens.
I actually really dig the Samsung keyboard and use it as my main one now. I like Google's alot as well and overall I think they are both pretty solid keyboards. I used to swear by Swiftkey but ever since it started having trouble with Textra I stopped using it and haven't looked back.
Great deal. Just ordered. Thanks for the share. Got the white one. 
Interestingly, I use Action as my launcher. But i notices the sams thing as you did with the google app. When im at the office, i have no use for it. So i disable the whole app. But when i get in my car, i turn it back and an notice a huge increase in power consumption. If you go to the ram part of the smart manager, youll notice it always running in the background and eating up battery.
Im noticing this same problem with my Google calendar. My other devices will show my events but not on the note 5
Your keyboard is not doing their job! 
It's definitely going to the google calendar. And now a phone-entered appointment that was showing on the desktop app yesterday is not showing there today. This is very frustrating. I'm going to delete my google account on my phone and then restore it to see what happens.
Rooting doesn't cause any issues with the s pen
Thank you, figured it out! Curse you for introducing me to Zooper.. Spent way more time customizing my widget than I would've liked
Coming from a Note 4 with fast charging and a replaceable battery, after 11 months of usage, I could definitely say that the batteries I fast charged were in poorer condition than the ones I didn't. They would get worse overall battery life, and often times would begin shutting the phone off with 10-20% battery left.
I totally agree with you... but disabler pro is a tool that you can use to gain things or to lose things....the point is to manually disable(dont disable what app suggest you as bloatware) every thing that you know you dont need so you have to know exactly what you disable....i didnt disable facebook and messenger like that guy cuz i need them...i Disabled other stuff that i know i dont use and they eat my batter life and ram. My smarthone this moment does what every user w/ edge plus/note5 can do hell i dont even wanna use baterry saving mode...this phone is a beast i will keep it as a beast..but touchwiz has so many useless things..im at 32% with 5 hours of sot...and thats 1 to 1 and a half hour more than before disabler pro...not mentioning the ram gain. So if u use this app correct you have a strong battery gain at least for me...i believe almost 1 hour and half is a lot of improvement. Cheers 
But isn't taking it on and off the charger before it's 100% constantly bad for the phones battery? 
Mine seems fine.  Off charger for 3 days and 9 hours (not kidding but I haven't used the phone much since it's my backup phone) and still at 26%  Trying to hit 4+ days just for the bragging rights
I like my 1st Gen Moto 360. Also, the Gear S2 works great with the Note 5, even if it's not an Android Wear watch. 
Pretty simple, been using the same layout more or less since my S2. Tried changing things up, always go back to this layout.http://i.imgur.com/nKsoChI.pngNova Launcher, Zooper Pro, Min for Zooper, Muzei LWP, HD Landscapes for Muzei, Whicons icon pack
Not really, for me its just the same sadly... I hoped I would get better battery but thats not the case here :*(
I have no complaints about battery life. I take it off my nightstand at 7:00am and it still almost always has at least 35% by the time I go to bed at midnight.I think turning off Google Location Services makes a bigger difference than simply disabling apps.
I have both. On lollipop the Note is the clear winner. The battery is abysmal on the S6. Hopefully Marshmallow will fix that.
You don't even have to install a rom. Especially since not all roms have it removed.  It's a very simple edit in a sql editor to get rid of it. Of course root is required. 
yeah, it should probably be an option but i think they do that since it has a little light on the front (which i prefer). And it can be color coded so i know whats what.
Here's how I did it, purchase a flip cover case and install smart gravity app, I disabled all unnecessary options and only turn on proximity sensor. (You can skip all this if your flip cover have magnetic) So every time I flip open the phone cover, the screen will turn on and I'll proceed to scan my fingerprint. 
Have you tried disabling animations under developer options? Of course they won't help with poor gaming performance,  but it should help out with choppy animations opening the app drawer and opening up apps. 
Welcome! I've had my Note 5 on Telus for a couple of months now.&gt Does anyone else know how the Samsung promotions currently work? I know there's the samsung pay, but my friend suggested I wait until there is a really eye catching offer out there (He said the best is a 100$ gift card for use on the samsung store only). Or should I just grab what I can now and go with it?The Samsung Promotions are okay, but there are definitely some interesting ones. As for Samsung Pay, it's not available in Canada yet. That means the promotions that Samsung are offering for Samsung Pay will not work for us Canadians. You need to add a supported card (US Banks) to benefit.&gt On a side note, does anyone else dislike the Black/Blue color scheme? I really wanted either the Gold or the Silver to differentiate from most of the S6 Edges and stuff out there, and the fingerprints on the back seem more noticable in the black color.I honestly enjoy the blue/black colour! Take a look at my answer below to see what I recommend for fingerprints.&gt Does anyone have a case suggestion out there? I used to use one of those plastic covering ones, but those seem to make the phone even bigger in the pocket than it already is.I've bought 2 cases for the phone since I purchased it, it's a really slippery phone and I definitely didn't want to drop my phone. I first bought the Ringke Slim, which is very basic, but I find doesn't give you much more grip.I then bought the Spigen Neo Hybrid Crystal, which is what I'd recommend. It's a bit more bulkier than the Ringke, but it's still minimalistic. This definitely adds more grip than the Ringke, or the naked phone. I find that the case is a bit of a fingerprint magnet, but you can wipe it down every so often.If you want to remove fingerprints from the back of the phone and add grip and not use a case... dBrand!! I absolutely love my dBrand skin (mahogany), it makes the phone look really really nice and it adds some grip! Definitely take a look at that if you're interested.Hope this helps!
I've heard blackplayer is good and have really wanted to try it out, but not even worth bothering with the glitch issue. I've liked Shuttle before. Poweramp is good, except it NEVER seems to stay in memory. I'll pause it for 1seconds to answer a question at work, and have to unlock the phone to re-launch the app because the lockscreen widget is gone.Generally, my listening is done through Spotify and Subsonic. I run a Subsonic server on my desktop PC which houses 1+ TB of live music (Phish, Dave Matthews Band, Grateful Dead...) and I listen to a lot of that. I prefer to stream through dSub, the subsonic player, but with this glitch issue, I have to pre-queue the tracks/albums I want and play through Poweramp, since 95% of it is VBR MP3. So, my bigger problem isn't necessarily that Poweramp isn't my favorite, but that it doesn't fit into my 'workflow' of listening to music the way I like to listen. And the widget disappearing from the lock screen is pretty annoying. I will say, the EQ options and features are pretty impressive in Poweramp
I was getting similar with both Spotify and Amazon Music.  The other issue is when I shut off the car after playing music via Bluetooth, the music continues on the phone speaker instead of pausing.
Well the silver is beautiful BUT no Samsung pay on the n920c. Not a total deal-breaker but worth noting.
Developer mode would not have any impact on you receiving updates. Did you try manually checking for updates yet? May not yet have been made available for you.
Yes you can be in a group chat with all iPhone users. But your messages will be green.  Not sent as an imessage
I got so lucky. I was about to fork over the full price for upgrade last week and  didn't have time so I went in today on my day off and fucking BAM! Shit works out sometimes. I'm sure my truck will break down tomorrow though. 
It's  $10off at tmobile currently. So try tmobile. Also trades can knock the price down a decent bit too  it would be the best option if you want samsung pay. 
yeah, i have big hands but not being able to reach all four corners of the screen with my thumb is a deal breaker for me, i really liked the SPen and i'll probably miss it but yah, the Edge's size is perfect for me, only thing i'm worried about is how fragile the edges feel
are you on Sprint? if yes when you activate the phone you should have an email with the MSL, otherwise the Support chat would usually give it to you.
Had the same android system and android os issue after receiving the update. Created a [thread](https://redd.it/3s1wkm) about it and it seems like few others also have similar issues. No fix yet for me.

I had the same thing happen!!! I got the white one first, then the sapphire black. Decided to give the white one to a friend with a note and no wireless charger :).
Are you just using the regular camera appany special setting?
dropped mine a few times --with a case on -- and the s-pen would fall out. then the s-pen broke. then the display died but idk if that is correlated. but sprint replaced the phone and i've had no issues, s-pen related or display related, since. 
I'm impressed that Google Play Services is not there. It's always the first in my list.
I love my S-View case.  Great functionality. 
&gt I do my best to keep my phones in tip top shape&gtI demonstrate how tough the Zagg Glass Screen Protector and Otterbox Symmetry is by dropping my phone on the carpet from hip height Well dropping your phone is not keeping it in tip top shape. Never going to buy an otter box because obviously its not protecting your phone as advertised. My advice to you don't drop your phone period. Cases are there for if and when you drop your phone, not to demo how good / bad the cases are.
I've had the n5 for two years now and it's been very solid, but I am a bit bored of stock Android, but then again I never bothered downloading anything to customise it. Shame they sold out of the black on that website, will have to go for white unless someone can suggest another site around the same price point.Thanks for the link.
Just started last night. I often listen to a playlist while playing games on my desktop, and use my phone to control Spotify. Twice last night it became unresponsive and I had to restart my phone...
I hope it is like that. I saw a video on YouTube where a guy was opening the box and it said on the  side that it was region locked. There was a sticker which said that. That's why I'm worried 
Try turning power saving mode back on then turning haptic feedback on there and then coming out of power saving mode.

I definitely noticed the charge time difference between charging with USB attached to a computer, to charging with the fast charge block. PC charging was always like that ---&gt 4 hours average. Makes sense because those USB ports don't put out enough power in the first place. Replacing the cable didn't work for me, so that was a needless purchase. Former iPhoner here too. If I have to mail it in again within the year, than the rants will begin :)
Same exact one here. It actually prevents me from properly putting an aux jack in there. Good case, but I need a different cord now.
Thanks for the post. I almost missed out on this deal. I was able to squeeze in just in time. 10bucks isn't a bad deal.. Maybe i'll get another quick charger or something else. Not sure what to spend the money on since i already have 2 charger and a case .
No features locked to my knowledge. AT&ampT has been known for their late updates and bloatware, but besides that I believe its the same as buying an unlocked one. Though I know on other galaxy(maybe just android) devices they advertised faster downloading by combining Wi-Fi and LTE, and that was locked, but I don't know if that is still a feature on the Note 5. 
I have one of these pens.  I can't say it's 10percent compatible with the Note 5.  I originally had one for the Note 2.  It worked as well as the built in stylus for the Note 2.I recently purchased another one for the Note 5.  But, it seems less sensitive than the Note 5 stylus.  Taps are often missed.  Sweep gestures for scrolling are often mistaken as taps.  Writing notes in S-Notes are error free, however.  The error rate seems slightly less with the included rubber tip vs. the all plastic one.  My Note 5 stylus is accurate every time.

Have had it for a while now and I have never come close to putting it in that way. The only time I think about it is when someone else pops the stylus out, and I explain to them to be super careful when putting bit back in. 
I do have a note I wrote that and I already got the package disabler.  Side sync adapters was killing my battery
Does disabling google location history, but having location still on still work? For example if I were to turn on snapchat/google maps, it would only then use my location when I open those apps up? and the battery drain will be less? Is location history only really for stuff such as their opinion survey/keeping up with where you are?
Package disabler pro, disabled stuff I don't use, and it's called advanced calling on the Verizon version.  I have it enabled on mine
Indian preorders have a $25 one-time screen replacement option within the warranty period. I think I'll replace it near the end of the warranty period whether or not it gets cracked minor scratches got on and they suck.
Is PocketCast worth the money? I already use podcast and radio adict and it works fine hust curious if it's worth the upgrade. Sam for fenix not sure if id pay the 7 rollars for it
Your comment is totally out of context here. OP received an update on AT&ampT Note 5 and he is just asking what it is.
Already cracked , I was hoping it could be removed and replaced with a plastic or rubber back
It optmizes the power that an app can drain especially lesser used apps, it doesn't affect quality at all, it just hepls the OS distribute power more effeciently, moreover the apps can still give notifications while being optimized.
Yeah, that's not great. I get ~20h mixed usage including 4-5h SOT, and from what I can tell I'm not an outlier. I'm happy to share what I did to get there to see if it can help you out. For starters, I'm sure you know that Android System and the kernel are not unnecessary services. Nothing else on that list is too egregious, so lets look at settings instead. Do you have:WiFi off during sleep? (Settings&gtWiFi&gtAdvanced)Background data disabled for Google Play Services? (If you look at the Android battery history, GPS is probably high on the list. Tap it and then tap Disable Background Data - this will prevent it from waking up the phone during sleep if you also have WiFi off during sleep)Don't let Google scan your WiFi networks to find your location when the phone is off. I think it's in the Google Settings App. Also, l keep Location Services off when I'm not actively using them for navigation or something.You can probably be more liberal in your use of Package Disabler Pro. There's a great thread on XDA that can help you figure out what's safe to disable. Cutting down on extraneous services really helps the phone idle for longer.Is Cell Standby high on your Android battery history? There's several fixes for this issue which vary by carrier - Google it to learn how to fix it for your phone. That's what I got for now. These steps should dramatically increase your phone's idle time due to less services running and radio use during sleep, and your SOT will also rise as a result of the extra battery life. If you can't figure out how to get to any of these settings, just Google it. It's all been done before. Good luck!
I honestly did not look too close at the packaging to see if it was also defective or could have been a contributor to the skin at all. I did send an email which was answered the day before you're response here and said the free replacement was being shipped out! Thank you for the response on here as well and I look forward to posting again after the replacement has arrived. Great customer service! 
As far as I'm aware its not the cable that's fast charge its the charger plug itself. I'm sure someone will correct me if I'm wrong. However that will be why your cable gets hot because it charges at 2A. 
It depends on your preferences. For me, I like clean-looking design and added functionality so I download the material dark theme, nova launcher, and a minimalist icon pack - then tweak the home screen layout and gesture settings to my liking.If I was setting up this same phone for my luddite parents, I'd opt for a simplified launcher such as Touchwiz Easy Home mode or Wiser Launcher - and then set up their favorite contacts/speed dial settings... or better yet, just buy them a new iPhone and save yourself some headaches.
I'm on the same fence between the Note 5 and Nexus 6P. Will probably go Note 5, just waiting for black Friday deals on an unlocked Note 5.
I stuck with a s4 for 2.5 years and never replaced the battery. Sure it had a little less life but not to the point where it hindered me in any way.   I'm sure I'll be fine with the note 5 too especially considering its already increased battery size for me. 
Same here.  Thing that pisses me off the most is when my Bluetooth disconnects it just keeps playing.  Even after hitting the close for the notification.  I have to clear the app in recent just to get it to shut off. This is fucking basic stuff...
I think I got a faulty device:(. I'm taking it in tomorrow. My microphone doesn't work either. And when I said the sound was weak I meant like even at full volume the sound was hardly audible. 
I was using the Spigen Rugged Armor.  Despite the name it's just a slightly stiffer TPU with a matte black and carbon fiber look to it.  Nice and slim, cheap too.  Like $11 on Amazon.
Note 5 will get Marshmallow in December. It is absolutely fantastic device and as the other comment said, Note 5 will be the flagship note till August / September of next year.Apart from that, I believe Note series always turns out better than their S lineup counterparts. You might want to jump on the Note upgrade cycle rather than Galaxy S upgrade cycle. 
Well, there are some videos of a guy showing how to get it out without damaging the sensor and even how to fix a broken sensor but yes you are right this in fact is a red flag.For a device worth $700, I am pretty sure I deserve some peace of mind while using it, which I actually don't have. It is good thing that I don't need my stylus much. Edit: Oh, yeah you are right, there is no way to get a stuck in the right direction s-pen out without breaking the pen. The original pengate is solvable though. 
Samsung is doing a repair for me. 
We have the ceo of snapchat to thank for that. He's biased against any operating system besides ios :L
Pebble Time 
What?  No.  The only phones that have Marshmallow right now are the Nexus models, the LG G4 in Korea and Poland, and the HTC One A9.  I don't expect the note to have Marshmallow until at least 2016.  
Now they give you $10coupon for their website so you can get the fast wireless charger instead
Every phone on the market (even the mighty iPhone and Nexus devices) will hiccup or lag at some point in time. Apps can be blamed for it, too. That's just the way it is. That said, I've never experienced any lag that on the Note5 that I would even consider annoying. 
Mine was the transparent purple Gameboy color...I miss that thing SO MUCH. I also had an original gameboy...grey...dropped it in the bathtub :'(

Updates get passed through carriers to make sure everything works on their network and make sure their bloat works. Or in the case of T-Mobile, they want to make sure WiFi calling works.
I use both the symmetry and commuter and it is very easy to get my pen out with cut fingernails.
Yes everything still works flawlessly with this rom.
I noticed the new charger gets really hot.
If you're talking about the Samsung pay promotion, no I haven't got anything yet. Got 2 emails saying it's on back order though.
It has the latest update, so every time I  turn my screen off Im should turn ultra battery mode on?
That is a very good question... Not that I know of, but you could always re-upload to imgur. It strips all that data from the picture. 
Does the note 5 s camera use sapphire glass ?
so far naked and its been fine, I've only been able to spot one tiny scratch that isn't deep at all.
I'm happy with my Note 5, but aside from the fingerprint reader I can't really justify it over the G4 for $35less (Using T-Mobile pricing since you will be too), or even the V1coming out tomorrow for $20less.  That being said, it's a great phone, especially after root and a custom ROM.  
[Here's mine!](http://i.imgur.com/agDgmzv.jpg)Nova LauncherWhicons Icon SetTransparent Weather ClockAnd some Mad Max love! 
One case I can say to probably stay away from is the Platinum with kickstand. The magnet when the kickstand rests interferes with the S-Pen and causes a blank spot over that area. 
To elaborate, extra software on the AT&ampT/Verizon phones causes them to intentionally brick themselves if root access is detected. If you pick up a phone at T-Mo for full price, make sure they unlock the SIM before you leave or it won't work on AT&ampT.Also, S-pay only works on certain variants. AT&ampT is one of them. Not sure about the others. That's why I ended up submitting to their evil and buying from AT&ampT.
Pull down with one finger, tap the pencil icon, and you should have if in a tray down bottom. I do. 
FYI... Lots of others complaining about this on the Spotify Community. I disabled App Optimization last night and it's happened to me twice today so it's definitely unrelated to app optimization.

Are people really complaining they can't use the fingerprint scanner on a waterproof case? Really.
Just check out some of the reviews and note 5 nexus 6p YouTube videos, it's not that much better but better non the less considering the note 5 has a 300mah smaller battery. I think the note 5 is heavily optimized for video playback due to licensed codecs or something like that,  Samsung usually paid and include them as part of TW while google doesn't iirc. Maybe if you use MX Player with HW+ enabled you could get good times too.. Dunno. Compared to my heavily modded lg g 2 pro, the note 5 isnt anything special but it's getting there with new kernels. I suppose I'm spoilt because I used to carry around a spare battery with my G Pro 2 and cant for note 5 (carrying around heavy battery bank) 
I placed my order on October 2nd the day i purchased my Note 5 from T-mobile, I completed all the steps activated Samsung pay with a Bank of America card got an email saying the order has been placed and even gave me an order #, i have yet to receive this charger and when i called this afternoon to inquire about it, the Samsung rep informed it that is currently back ordered and with no ETA when they will get more.I've been waiting almost a month for Samsung to ship a charger and I'm beginning to think this was a bait and switch promotion, don't hold your breath if you want a wireless charger if you want one your better off just buying a third party one from amazon. I think this is quite unbecoming for a company as big as Samsung to lie to it's customers with fake promotions.edit for typos.
Someone explain the wait 3minutes after hitting 100% thing? Never heard that one. Also does it apply to both regular and fast charge? I use both. 
I wonder if there is a way to take a piece of aluminium to a cnc shop and have them mill the exact dimensions of the Spen. Take the guts out and insert them in to the newly milled aluminium. 
I'm doing just fine as long as I don't download any music from Play Music. 16gigs free. Most all of my stuff stays in the cloud unless specifically requested to precipitate. 
no the screen sleeps.  ide like to leave the screen on whe charging because sometimes im doing stuff on it or looking at stuff.  But no it goes into sleep mode
I'm doing something wrong. Not a heavy user by any means, getting 2 hours of SOT and going to bed at around 30%. Leave location and Bluetooth on at all times. It shouldn't be that bad  right? 
Looking for a case that protects the screen when laying on a desk.and also protect the camera lense when laying on its back
You don't think the texture makes it a little grippier? I mainly like skins because they don't attract fingerprints
I've experience pretty slow wi-fi performance on mine and I've heard the same from others, though it's been somewhat improved by the last update... but never outright failure like you're describing... point being, I definitely get the sense there's some sort of wi-fi issue with this device for at least some people.  As someone else said, get it replaced, chances are you'll be good to go with a new one.
I got the black Rugged Armor Spigen case from Amazon. Also quite slim and matches rather nicely with my sapphire coloured Note 5. Great quality and has a great in the hand feel IMO.
use /r/spaceporn and find images larger than 2560x1440. They require resolution to be posted in the title of posts in square brackets. You can also use Google Images and expand Search Tools -&gt Size -&gt Larger Than -&gt 4MP.The higher the resolution of the image the better. Just remember real images of space are only as detailed or HD as the cameras on the telescopes allow. This 3683x306images: http://www.cosmotography.com/images/gabany_m51_sn2011.jpg is well above HD dimensions but I wouldn't call the image itself high definition which is typical for images of deep space. They tend to look better if you find an image that's super large and scale it down because the scaling smooths some of the artifcating. 
Is your phone screen lock set to fingerprint? I had the exact same issue, and then I changed the phone unlock action to swipe (aka no security). All the top row buttons (erase/delete/save) worked after that.
You have some kind of screen overlay app installed like a dimmer. Disable it. It's a security feature - you can't sideload apps when there's a screen overlay present. 
If you still have the opportunity send it back for a new one, might be a defective model.
Exactly what I thought...It looks so ridiculous. I have the Material Dark theme so I guess it doesn't matter anyway. But regardless, this was a poor design choice...
Do a factory reset,  if no good call Samsung for replacement

coming from the note 3 to the note 5.the software improvements on the note 5 take the cake for me. I love the note 3 for being everything I thought it should be, the 5 just does it better for me
Save it to your Gallery instead of saving to Scrapbook.
I've been eyeing that one for a while. I'm kind of drowning in qi chargers at the moment (I have... seven now, I think?), but if/when I need a new one that'll probably be the one I end up getting.
Huh, this is super interesting. But has anyone ever gotten it to work properly? I'm fiddling with it now and it seems to have two issues -- for one, the app tends to crash (gives me a message out of the blue saying it's closing.) And two, sometimes voice commands fail with a message saying that the app can't access the microphone (I did disable both S Voice and the native Google Now voice monitoring). Perhaps the pay version is more reliable (I nly have the free version), or there's some other setting I could tweak? Would love to hear any success stories with Open Mic+ on a Samsung phone.
Put it towards a GearVR, if you're into that sorta thing. $10retail AFAIK.
Gear vr has been the game plan from the moment I heard about it. But I might look at a gear s2 but most likely the gear vr
I can't quality for samsung pay, they told me i was too stupid.   :(
I tried all manner of fixes, including Root Cloak, and couldn't get Android Pay to work.  Ended up unrooting because of it. :(  Loved paying w/ my phone at my work's vending machines and my grocery store more than I liked the deep tweaks.
Nah, I'm just gonna keep using my apps. I don't mind giving the phone a little boost throughout the day if it needs it, and actually paying attention to it I get pretty great battery life and screen on time in general ) thanks for the tip tho, if I ever am in a pinch I'll do that!
What? That screenshot is showing that theyre all off. I known quite a few were on by default.
I wonder is T-mobile is handling security patched directly.
I keep my data off when not in a good data area, screen at ~30% brightness and only turn it up when it's hard to see, power saving mode on 100% of the time, no touch vibe feedback at all, that's basically it.
I find the icon swipes, gestures, and custom drawer groups to be invaluable. Being able to double tap on home screen to lock is probably my favorite feature.
On my device, the Google Play media controls are visible and interactive on the default lockscreen via the persistent notification.This is different from how my last phone (Motorola Droid Maxx) would show the album art in place of the lock screen background and change the layout of the lock screen to directly include media controls.But, it's functionally equivalent.
I've done a soft reset on the phone, but I haven't deleted my old devices. I'll try that, thanks. 
When was the last time you updated your sync?
You can try enabling Power Saving mode and in settings set it so that the display is dim and greyscale. You could also download an app like Bluelight Filter. Both strategies help for reading.
You are probably right, I have insurance and can trade this thing in all the time. Time to go naked.
Any update?
dont know about the wacom stylus, but Note 2 is compatible with the 5. used it while the Note 5's is both docked and undocked 
Checked on international version and didn't see it.
Keep in mind if you don't get the T-Mobile version you will NOT get VoLTE WiFi calling or band 12 voice (since its VoLTE.)

Don't even attempt to root.  As the others have said there is no root for the Verizon variant and there is a KNOX lock that will effectively brick your phone until factory settings restored.
samedesktop app works fine, but on my Note 5 it just stopstried turning off wifi and data, but still shuts off randomly
The button on my S3 still feels the same after 3 years so I'm not too concerned. 
Google Music doesn't eat up any extra data. Once a song is cached, you can listen to it offline as much as you want without using a bit of data. You can choose which songs to cache and so on. 
It let's you adjust a lot of settings regarding the phone audio. There is a section for wired headset settings where you can set it to max out auduo volume or set it wherever you want when something is plugged in. I think you still tend to get the warning once after a reboot but you don't need to adjust the audio every time you connect an aux cable. The app wants a persistent notification which I allowed but then hid in application settings. 
I have [This one](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.pierrox.lightning_launcher_extreme&amphl=en). Not on amazon, but on Google Play store. I think it used to be heirarched as a free and non-free version, then the dev just made the whole thing cost one price instead of bothering with it.It was worth every penny.
Zooper is amazing. I have sections of my clock that launch my favorite apps when touched. 
and don't have too many prints on file.  when i first got my s6 i saved both my thumbs and index fingers.  the fingerprint reader was slow and would fail a lot.  i eventually disabled it.  i enabled it again a few months later because i wanted to try samsung pay but this time i only imprinted one thumb. works like a charm, really fast and no errors.
It doesn't add it to my calendar though so it doesn't show up on my calendar widget. 
Mine has a much subtler pink-orange tint.Yours is just crazy. Demand a replacement.
I've read the negative reviews and I haven't had any of that happen to me. I honestly don't even understand how the case could push the power button in. Stains and scratches easily? How is that even possible? Maybe certain colors I guess(I got the black one so not possible). Adds noticeable bulk? What the fuck. It's still so thin!Something weird going on here...Anyway I'm telling you it's absolutely perfect. 
I use the chrome browser on my PC, so everything is in sync with my phone. Other than that I'd belive the chrome will load said faster. It's Google's browser running on Google's OS..
it was saying that samsungsydcyn was using most of the cpu but i don't know what to do about that 
Nope. Cause was an update that wouldn't come OTA for some reason and that AT&ampT was unaware of existing for some reason. Samsung rep at Best Buy was able to update the FW and it works fine now.
My screen kept turning on during phone calls running ater97, not really sure why
I googled note 5 battery drain and the first website talking about battery drain had a screenshot of that page showing 19 hours left on 100%. So I thought maybe my battery might be screwed.
S note syncs to Evernote so do something inside of Evernote?there might be some sort of share option in ever note to s planer
I find it most useful for web pages that aren't formatted for mobile. Much easier than trying to click links with a fat finger. 
In some apps, it registers a light touch when *very nearly* physically touching. And the button is interpreted as a touch in some apps, it seems.
I had a uag case for a while, and using audio cable daily, had no problems.  I have since gotten a dbrand skin and opted for the ringke fusion smoke case, which is slightly thinner, but also has a small flap over the headphone jack.  I upgraded to a Bluetooth radio in my vehicle at the same time, so I don't really use the aux jack anymore.  The uag case was pretty nice though!
Aside from the free app in Galaxy apps, which you've found by now:We don't like in-app purchases, ads, or subscriptions, so we've been staying away from that, though we are considering a more basic free version. We have a full demo of the desktop program on our website - the tools act the same ways cross all the apps, so people can get an idea of whether it's what they're looking for. And we're happy to refund anyone who doesn't like it, or has trouble using the app on their device (you just have to contact us with the order number from the Play Store).Oh, right, and to the actual *question*: The incentive to try ArtRage is that it's the best natural media painting app out there (well, as far as we're concerned, but we get a lot of people agreeing with us). We have awesome oils, watery watercolours, crayon, chalk, felt pen, pencil, thick globby paint tubes, and real canvas textures, as well as integration with our other editions on different platforms (you can edit your Android paintings on our desktop, or even our iPad, versions), as well as good support and as few bugs as we can possibly manage.We've also got an awesome reference picture function - pin up pictures all around your work space!We're NOT the same as Sketchbook, or Medibang, or other drawing apps, and ArtRage generally complements them, rather than replaces them, for most users. If you want a realistic painting program, get us. If you want something to draw digitally in, and don't care at all about how much like a pencil it feels, or how well the media mixes, then... maybe get us, but you probably will only want to use a few of the tools. You can do just about anything you can do in another app, but the workflow is a bit different. So instead of a full range of premade brush tips that make up 70% of the actual tools, you get one ink pen and the option to set it up 3different ways and save those as presets for inking and colouring (the airbrush can mimic a good Photoshop brush, with the right settings). Which might or might not be what you want. If you don't care about that and just want to learn oil painting or get some nice traditional effects, then ArtRage is perfect.
What have you done to get that? I'm at school most days so I'm listening to music, checking Instagram and Reddit so on and when I get home I'm watching videos and listening to more music.I average about 2-3 hours of screen on time and I have not so good standby time
No I'm asking if the adaptor you have does work with the note 5 because you'd be the first to have mhl since samsung says it doesn't support it on the note 5
Came here to say this. Textra is awesome. You can set custom colors, vibration patterns, and sounds for different contacts. Super customizable and way better than ugly ass Samsung messages. Also beats Google Messenger, IMO. 
I bought 5 different cases, the best by far was the spigen slim armor.
I did everything you suggested, and more. I also turn off my accounts' auto sync option, and while I'm at work, I disable the google app. I only turn it on when I'm driving because I like to dictate my text messages when I'm in the car. I've gotten over 7 hours that way. Great post!
Have a link to the note 5 case? Just watched this video and i want the combo
Why not just get the official Sview leather cover? Its amazing.Btw DO NOT buy the official clear case as it scratches really really easily and looks really poor after a few days. The concept is amazing but until they come up with a better material just make do with the faux leather official case!
I hope so.  Bought it on amazon so the return will be easy if it's the charger but doing a search on here someone posted a video of a Note 5 only working on Samsung chargers while saying his friend's Note 5 worked on all.  Really hope that's not the case.
I think it's already military grade aluminium. This pen is not plastic.
My step dad still plays his red transparent Game boy. No AC adaptor. Buys new batteries everytime.Though not recently. I think everyone in his age group is addicted to Candy Crush now. CC feels like that advert in the Leprechaun horror movie only for middle aged people.
The only way I've found so far is to get Tasker &amp Secure settings and set up a profile so when there is a notification the screen illuminates. Its a real pain that it's not a default feature
For the case, I'm using the Ringke Fusion. Cheap, looks good, and protects the phone just fine. The combination of the screen protector and case work well and look beautiful on my Note, which is white. I got the clear case. No halo effect with the JETech.Edit: the screen protector saved my ass many times with the iPhone 6 Plus. I ended up replacing it a few times but it's better than replacing the screen. The Note is much harder for me to hold and manage for some reason (one handed). 
I have the Spigen Neo Hybrid carbon case. I've dropped my phone a couple times and it's fine. I had to replace a tempered glass screen protector once after dropping it face down onto the cement.
That's not a solution to *this* problem. The post is regarding the issue of having already done it and now having a S Pen that won't work. What is don't put the S Pen in backwards going do for someone with that issue? Since Samsung knows many people have inserted the S Pen incorrectly, what they should have done was provided a work around on how to get it working despite the mistake. Which is what I was looking for when I screwed up but could not find. &gtThere are very few S-Pen settings so it would be easy to test all of them to find a solution.Okay? Regardless of how easy it is to test all solutions, it's not immediately clear that messing around with the S Pen section is what's needed to fix the problem. It's completely fair for someone to expect that if search google or this subreddit, they'll come across a result that says Oh, just turn this off to get it working.Not sure what you're even arguing for man. This is a helpful post for people who made the mistake I had. You're just coming off as a dick. &gtEnjoy your broken Note5. No skin off my hide.Lmao yeah you're a dick.     
I'm lucky enough to have BoA and have been using Samsung Pay since beta about a month ago. But the number of supported cards is pretty discouraging. In their announcement of Pay they were talking about it being compatible with ANY card in your wallet. Gift cards, debit cards, credit cards, store rewards cards, etc. Then here we are almost two months later and they still only support a few banks?? I'm losing faith every day that they'll ever climb this mountain. I think some unforeseen obstacle has obstructed their path. Pay is not as advertised at all, and Samsung have given zero information about when it will be.
woah wait what? As in I can import notes in or edit Snotes in Evernote too? 
Really? You must not be on auto-brightness then because my phone always dims way too much at night. I usually just set the brightness to ~25% at that point. 
Although they get all the brand new iPhone colors. Come on Verizon. At least give us the colors we want for the good phones instead of the garbage ones.
I got the note 5, battery life is a big improvement from previous phone. I would go with it simply because of how great it feels in your hand.
I've always left it on with my past phones. Shouldn't it not activate GPS unless an app needs location? My battery doesn't even normally drop that fast during the day with use. 
Hey mate,just wondering how long you have had the phone for?I have the international model and used PDP after 2 days of horrid battery life. It gave me 3 days of amazing (5-6H SOT) then 2 days of average battery. (2-3H)I enabled everything again and so far have been getting 4-5hours SOT (Which is far more than enough for me.)So not sure if it just took a few charges to get everything set up right but may be fine with out it...Unless you are after the 10hours+ sot experience.
I just bought a wired 36controller and tried the same thing, no luck. There are a few posts here &amp there about the Galaxy S6 having the same issue.. the center button ring flashes and that's it. I don't believe the current generation S6/edge/note5/edge+ support the wired 36a controller at this time. Hopefully someone can prove me wrong.
That you can't remove it and that it's smaller than the Note 4s.  Granted, the phone lasts longer in my experience than a Note 4 and I don't know why you'd need an extra battery when the phone lasts all day easily, but to each their own.
Does it say fast charging?
Yes! It takes a heat gun (for me I used a blow dryer), a guitar pick (to crack open the sides) and a auction cup (to suck up the glass when its loose). There are definitely videos in YouTube that shows how its done
Yea it's really nice since the noble kernel is having reboot issues. 
I trade phones all of the time. I had a G4 and am on my second Note 5. The G4 is not even close at all in my opinion. The Note is better in every way: screen, battery, performance, camera, etc. The ONLY things going for the G4 IMO are the removable storage and battery - not deal breakers for me and I prefer the slick design of the new Samsungs. I always end up coming back to the Note series. I had been looking for a good deal on a Note 5 ever since I traded mine back in on T-Mobile's Jump On Demand plan. I got a 6s Plus because they hold their value so well, and I plan on selling it once I pay it off. I found a great deal on a Note 5 on craigslist after a good deal of searching and someone trying to sell me a fake one. I am not looking back, the Note 5 is my favorite phone out of the probably 3or so models I have had. I plan on keeping it at least until the S7 comes out.TLDR: Stick with your Note.
Just got the Spigen Ultra Hybrid in clear and I'm quite happy with it. Nice fit, decent drop protection, and it shows off the phone. 
No, Advanced calling is a Verizon feature. It's what they branded their VoLTE, to make it seem like their services are magical and special.
Interestingly I don't have that at all on my tmobile note 5. The last setting at the bottom is s pen vibration
Thank you for the comprehensive writeup! Definitely the most helpful out of both of my posts, and it didn't sound like it was written by a fanboy!I'm definitely leaning more towards the Note 5 at this point. The LG is nice, and if the V1were out by now it may have changed my mind, but the consensus seems to be that the Note 5 is a superior phone in most aspects.Removable storage is not a deal breaker for me - I mostly stream music, and when I download podcasts etc, I usually delete them after I listen.I'm no photographer, and hardly ever use my camera, so I don't anticipate running out of space with the 32gb model anyway.I think what did it was S Pen utilization (I take a lot of notes) and the display, which is really what I'm looking for in a phone right now after shattering my LG and being on a Moto G for the past three months.Plus the horror stories of the G4 overheating are definitely off putting. Thanks again, I appreciate your post!
Hah your post is ALL assumption and you can't even prove otherwise.  You think from these posts you know exactly how someone spends their day. It's pretty easy to test SoT without even sitting there on your phone constantly. Hah maybe you need to relax. Can't wait for the headline, a rash of child neglect cases because users are pushing the limits of the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 battery life...  
You would probably have an easier time asking people for $6to buy a wireless charger.
I know it shouldn't be an issue, but I actually play *a lot* of Hearthstone (just had a baby girl, and it's just so much more accessible for me to play games on my phone now than my PC / Xbox One), and I've heard of a lot of problems with HS crashing on Note 5s. Has this been rectified?Thanks for the response!
Does the added light that gets through the clear film have an impact on picture quality?  Or is the camera isolated enough for this not to matter?
I had a bunch of issues getting it synced while setting it up, kept disconnecting, saying things were missing, going to the wrong watch faces... after a bunch of reboots it just finally started working, no issues since then.
I shocked my wife the other day by saying: I love this phone about my Note 5.  I've never loved a phone, they've always irritated me somehow.  Maybe it's the phone, maybe it's this version of Android/Touchwiz - whatever, I like the phone.I had reservations at first because of the non-removable back and inability to add memory or change the battery but I find battery life is good and you can get external battery packs that last forever.  As for the memory issue, I picked up a [cheap](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00R0ZAMTM?psc=1&ampredirect=true&ampref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00) mini-usb to SD card adapter and it works well but for an even easier memory add on you could try a [wireless stick](http://www.appy-geek.com/Web/ArticleWeb.aspx?regionid=1&amparticleid=48146264) which looks like it would be awesome.No problems with mine after over a month of use and it's tougher than it looks.  I did get a Supcase Unicorn Beetle [case](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013D247KU?psc=1&ampredirect=true&ampref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00) for it and a tempered glass screen [protector](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01188WFEG?psc=1&ampredirect=true&ampref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00).  so far, so good.
Ye i should have done google photos now that i think about it
All right. I was reading the reviews on the game and every one was complaining about the massive amount of notifications that they were getting. I'll check it out, thanks!
The 920c supports all 3 lte bands for Europe right? 3 7 and 20?
That would be the WiFi... thanks and apologies.
I have the PIN requirement at work, too (and they, frustratingly, disable Smart Lock as an option, as well). The fingerprint sensor works as a replacement for the PIN requirement, though, which is super handy.That being said - I ended up setting the phone up that way (in accordance with our IT policies), then installing CloudMagic for email and Exchange Calendar Sync from the Play Store - setting those up so I had email and calendar syncing - then restored to stock so I had full control over my phone, instead of complying with IT policies.Just a suggestion.
Is NFC unaffected? Is it in the battery again, or is the antenna this silver/golden thing on the side of the back?
Hmm that's odd. Does that pen require a battery?
The screen is slightly curved.
I tried it and so far it is working great! Battery drain isn't there, or if there is, it is so minimal that I haven't noticed it. Great app indeed. Thanks! 
You'd be surprised how well wireless charging works... We tested it and you can hold a phone in the air 1-2 above the pad and still have it charge
Where is the write on pdf app?
JUST CLICK THE DAMN BUTTON
It is not. Hotspot can be added on to get 3gb for $1a month, I believe.
Thanks for that info, have you ever experienced any issue while streaming a video across the internet? I have as most of us have. A friend of mine in Raytown, Mo even has and she has Google fiber. So again streaming is not at all what my post is about. It is about trying to figure out how to deal with the storage problems of trying to have a library of a few movies at your diposal. Looks like the only option is to swap movies with a flash drive and make sure you have the necessary space (20gb free). Maybe the files don't need to be that big but I haven't been aw to find any solid info on this. 
Works fine for me, just the other day i was in the snow with my friends and had gloves on do i thought i couldn't use my phone. And then i remembered how sensitive it is. Works like a charm for me.
What are those icons called?
if I had your kind of luck I'd buy a lottery ticket.  I left my S4 on top of my car and drove off and when I went back to get it the screen was cracked everywhere.  but at least it still worked.  I replaced the screen and then dropped in the front yard where it got watered by sprinklers - completely dead this time.  I've dropped my Note 5 a couple of times (short, gentle drops) and it's fine but it is in a case and it does have a screen protector.  Hopefully I'll be more careful with this phone than the S4.
What theme do you have there? I believe mine is Marshmallow theme but in dark. I'm really loving that red and black dynamic. 
Hmm I disabled it. When I go to the play store, there's only one option to enable it back. What should I do?
But isn't a marshmallow update out for all versions? I think I read it's out even for my model but haven't been able to get it to show in software update for OTA
this is before update. https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz_pRv2NDuopTXIwbEVGRVdDVFE/view?usp=sharing This is after https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz_pRv2NDuopNk5OT0xUX3JMZVk/view?usp=sharing
This should do it. I used this a couple days ago on my ATT variant, that comes without the data toggle, and it was restored.
You can try Screen Filter. Its not dark mode but I like to use it during night time.
Thanks for the detailed response. What makes you say that the s6 edge + is better than the note 5 if I don't use the s pen?
[This](http://forum.xda-developers.com/attachment.php?s=88f4f8ef98af76769f34156b1dfd5db9&ampattachmentid=3543866&ampd=1447644288) screenshot most especially MRA58K is 6.0
I glad I have aukey chargers so I don't have to buy new ones.
Same thing happened to me, followed by rapid loss of battery life. I had to replace (warranty) the phone. 
Woah woah you mean an intense magnetic field means that a capacitive sensor doesn't work? Next you're going to tell me that magnetism and electric charges are orthogonal tensor products!!! 
Screen on time(SOT): is the time the screen has been on, it is cummulative, which means you turned the screen on for 15 minutes -&gt then off  for 1 hour-&gt then turned it on for 3minutes= 45 minutes of SOT, for me from 100% to 0% battery i usually get 6 +-2 hours of SOT.
Are you guys with the long SOTs using themes and background with lots of black and dark chilies?
It's just a tap to undo changes, so you can experiment a bit. Package Disabler Pro highlights what it considers bloat in pink.

Is there a carrier upgrade required to use Gear VR with the Note 5?
There may be third party lockscreens that can do it but not native AFAIK for now.
This is my favorite case out of 6-7 that I've tried.  I'd be using it now but I'm using a case thats easily removed for my VR Gear.
Not sure on the flashlight, I just use the quicksettings toggle. I have a VZW model and I get 4.5-5.5 hours of SOT depending on what I do throughout the day. On lighter days I can have as much as 35% battery by the time I go to bed. 
Alright mate be safe and merry Christmas!!!
Don't get an antivirus it's useless. Just don't download any apps outside the play store and you'll be fine. 
Try going to the settings within the app. There should be an option to use the in app browser (unless they took it out). Then what you can try is clearing all app defaults from your app settings, and then go to the twitter app, click a link, and it should ask you how you want to open it. I think that second solution is a bandaid and probably not he best so hopefully the first one works for you
Not for the bundles, my wife got her bundle a few days ago and she had a S5 before.  You get $10Play store credit if you switch from iPhone.
That's my favorite front and back combo! I decided to get a screen protector instead and keep the front gold. Hopefully it's a good one without halos/lifted edges.
No clue. Bought it unlocked internationally. I do know it comes with a two year warranty. Going to look into what it covers.
Absolutely love this phone. Came from a One Plus One and upgraded to this. My wife has the iPhone 6 plus and used to rave about it. After seeing my phone and the amazing camera, she wants a note. The camera alone sells this phone. It is unreal. I've had no ram management issues. Battery life is fantastic. Phone is snappy and fluid. I always root my phones but the new theme store makes changing the interface easy and feels like a different phone every theme. Just do ittttttttt 
I tried RAW mode a few times, but not seriously with this quantity of photos. Maybe 3 out of the few hundred are actually RAW.Indeed something weird went on with the geotagging. My best guess is some wifi MAC addresses show up in both places. No way GPS could make that mistake.
AFAIK the Abnormal Battery Usage section will tell you which ones are draining a lot of battery, but it won't be able to actually do anything to improve the battery life.
You can try to find the link online at forums like theverge and droid-life. I heard they might have froze the downloads and that if you didn't download it previously then you aren't able to until they unfreeze it
Oh well. I really only talk to my husband on the phone but it's loud on both ends so I was wondering if I could fix it. I had the galaxy s4 and it was nice not listening to his radio or the GPS while he drives all day! Just one of those first world problems I suppose. 
May I HIGHLY recommend Tasker to you, good sir. It's difficult to explain but it's clearly the best, most dynamic, most robust application for Android. See r/Tasker for more information. When I had cats, I put the app on an old phone, left it charging, and hung it over the edge of the counter in my kitchen so the camera pointed at the food bowl. I set it up to take a picture every two hours using Tasker. Then the picture was uploaded to Dropbox which let me remotely see the food situation. Also when my Dad was out of the country on business, he asked me to manage his calls and texts. Instead of carrying both my phone and his phone around, I put Tasker on his phone to alert me via text any time his phone received a text or missed call, including the message of the text and the name of the person that called. Tasker makes a smart phone a *fucking* smartphone. The possibilities are endless. My girlfriend, when getting ready in the morning, always asks what time it is while doing her makeup. I set a profile to just blurt out the time at maximum volume every 5 minutes from 0540AM to 0610AM on weekdays. Simple shit like that makes life easier. These are just my examples of what I've done with it. I used iOS for a year just for change and went back to Android with the Note 5. I love when iOS people, in their naivete, check the AppStore for Tasker, like Apple would ever give you that much control over how your phone works. Welcome to Android, friend. 
And I just got an email saying its still on backorder. Yay....
Apparently some are reporting that FB Messenger is the culprit.
I have a Verizon Note 5 and have had great luck with package disabler pro and Nova Launcher. I regularly get 4.5-5 hrs SOT if I'm using it a lot.
Awesome! Love that widget thanks! 
Nah that's what the s pen is for. 
What about those glass screen protectors if you're not wanting to get a plastic one? 
Google wallet worked but after the switch to android pay, no dice. Same with Samsung pay.
No it does not. I'm still trying to figure out what is killing my battery. I've done all of the tricks but I still have crappy battery life. I have the Verizon variant.
I really like my Zagg tempered glass protector and Speck Candyshell combo. The Candyshell is thin, but has really useful grips on the back so it feels great in the hand. 
keeping it ON, uses battery more though right? I want to save the battery
Are there benefits to getting the international model? Or a non-AT&ampT model?  Sounds like the biggest one is being able to root?
I use a body skin and a glass screen protector on the front
http://urbanarmorgear.com/collections/samsung-note-5-caseshad the UAG for my Note2...  got this for my Note5... love it.. 
Yeah I thought it was something different than the notification you get after taking those few steps. As far as I know there is no way to say check a log of events with a time stamp. 
I had to completly delete S Health after this update because every 15 mins I was getting a pop up closing the app, S Notes doing it to now. I have a feeling we will be seeing it very soon. I'm in Korea on LG U+
We do glass repairs for 150, if its the screen too its going to be an arm and a leg lol. your local shops may vary. Edit for spelling. Not used to the size of the note yet I guess!
So you're telling me that the music won't stop on incoming calls is a new feature?!?! I got my note 5 a few weeks ago and thought it's an issue with the note 5. I couldn't find any settings to disable it. Were you able to?
To answer a couple of your questions, you will need to install a custom recovery before installing a custom rom. When you install a custom rom it will delete all of your data and you will have to start fresh. Once you root you will lose samsung pay forever. There is no way to go backwards.My suggestion is to go into the XDA forums and look at the android evelopment section and read up on it. They have detailed instructions on what you want to do. http://forum.xda-developers.com/sprint-galaxy-note5I haven't personally rooted my phone yet since I haven't felt a need to and I am undecided on android pay personally.
Thanks, looks good. Not sure about the colourful time on the lock screen though... 
My favorite at the moment is Darthstalker. TEKHD is good as well. Those are the only two I like, as the other ROMs are implementing custom colors that seem to cause inconsistent brightness and transparency between elements in the status bar. Arter's kernel, version X is the most fluid for me (v11 has caused a lot of stutter on my phone). 
I believe Next SMS has an option to do that.
Neither Barclaycard nor Capital One are going to support Samsung Pay any time soon. I have both cards and I have called and tweeted to ask for SP support and they both are noncommittal. I think both have deals with Apple or are looking for some cash from Samsung in exchange for support. To be honest, I don't really care too much because their cards are not that great compared to my other cards. I already told both Barclaycard and Capital One customer service that I wouldn't be using those cards until they support Samsung Pay. I'll use the accounts occasionally for small purchases to keep them open, but I'm not going to be using them the way I'm using my other cards that support Samsung Pay.
Seconded Nova Launcher. You can change everything from the icon grid size, to icons themselves (get sets off of the Play Store) to gestures... If you're looking for physical protection, a clear skin or bumper case is your best bet to keep the phone looking awesome. Software-wise, an Antivirus should not be necessary for most users.Apps besides Nova I would recommend, which aren't necessarily exclusive to Android or the Note, include Google Keep, Samsung Pay (let's you pay with NFC or at old-fashioned terminals through magnetic magic... If your card is supported), Google Rewards (surveys for free Play credit), Snapseed (photo editing), If (formerly IFTTT), and most importantly Device Manager if it's not already on your phone. 
I don't know about other models, but rooting the T-Mobile version causes unpredictable rebooting and also destroys framerates in the Samsung Gear VR. 
I unsubbed from his channel months ago because he doesn't do great reviews. I don't watch his videos anymore, there are better more in depth reviewers that will tell it like it is, not just give specs and gloss over things. 
That is a good question, this battery is a fuckin champ.
Oooh sweet! Try and send me some pictures when you get them! I put the Blue Rhino Shield bumper on my Christmas list, would love to see how it looks with the Mahogany skin!
Whoa, so I can use CF Auto Root on my Tmo Note 5 without even erasing my data?One more question, what about using Samsung Pay while rooted?
I didn't disable EVERYTHING they said you could, mainly because there were some processes that I DID want. (Google Play games, for instance) but look through that list and see what else you can take care of without screwing up the phone.
I've had mine naked for a week now. Separate pockets as everyone else has said. Looks great except for the fingerprints all over the back. My case gets here today though, so I won't know about long term use without protection.
Next year marshmallow comes out
I have this case as well and don't find it slippery at all.  It's right at that sweet spot of providing a little grip for your fingers but not too much so it'll snag on your pockets. 
I don't know too much about rooting, to be honest. I want to root my Note 5 badly, but can't get past the warranty issue. I do know that sometimes, when you root this early on, there can be bugs and actually make things worst. I'd hate for you to root your phone to improve the wifi, only to find out your battery is now draining faster or something like that. There's a Samsung service center in my city. You can just walk in and have them fix it. Have you thought about that?
I did the same thing about a month ago. G4 is nice, but the Note 5 blows it out of the water. I also didn't have to tinker with it nearly as much as the G4 to get the battery to cooperate and stop overheating.
How much of an affect will this have on durability?
For anyone attempting this, it seems safer to buy the replacement back, strip the laminate from it, THEN do the swap.  
Imagine finding an empty card slot behind the glass. 
That's strange. I got my PS4 controller working on mine wirelessly and with OTG. Try holding the options and PS button down until the controller starts flashing with a white light, then navigate to bluetooth devices on your Note 5 and select the controller. It worked first time for me but I use OTG coz the bluetooth lags a bit.Might be worth noting I tried the bluetooth first so maybe that's what's needed before OTG works?
speaking about notifications when I first setup my phone it asks me to input my Voicemail number which for o2 UK is 901. However when I put this in I get Voicemail number change unsuccessful. This now leaves me with a voicemail notification icons that is very annoying.Any ideas how to remove this icon? 
as far as i know they decided to not add it to the update for verizon, the update is suppose to allow us to see the app in google play but i dont see it
That's your prerogative man. If your card doesn't work at a terminal because the terminal can't read it, they can type it in. What will you do if the terminal can't take Samsung pay and you ditched your wallet? Until it becomes standard, completely ditching your wallet is really not a realistic goal. 
The game seems pretty fun from what I've played of it, but I don't think they could make the ads more intrusive if they tried. 
How good is the wireless charger? Also does the phone need to be out of a case to be able to charge. 
You most likely have some app that is killing your performance. Do you have battery problems too?
Around ??430, which is about ??5or so more than I paid for my Edge, so wasn't too bad of a deal to be fair.
I had the same problem. I thought the digitizer might have been going bad. Happy to see other people are having the same issue 
I notice the apps reloading way to often. I switched from  the S6E and its just the same.   Feels like it has 1gb of ram. The nexus 6p I've had a chance to use for a week does alot better. 
Silly question. Did you take the plastic film off of it
Maybe he had a virus, or isis man, they're everywhere.
I figured out what it was and tested it with some other people. If you're having this issue, then I can almost guarantee that you have the latest updates installed for Facebook Messenger. Uninstall that app (or revert) and your problem will be solved. It was happening on my S6 Edge as well
I figured out the issue I believe. I was using package disabler and it disabled the MMS package. I did do a full reset but noticed that the MMS package was labeled as bloat wear when I started freezing unneeded services. It is working now.
It's weird how all the variants of the phone differ so much in battery life. Mine before I rooted and installed a new rom on my phone, had terrible battery life, where others on stock had great battery life 
I have the AT&ampT variant too but this only added the multiwindow toggle. Did you have to do anything else to get the data toggle working?
Im really hoping the marshmallow update in December is the difference maker.
No regrets... Never had Samsung before this, had other androids. This is by far the best phone I've had. Didn't bother rooting or going stock Android, just installed buzz launcher and applied a theme to the os 
When I had my Note 2 I set it up so when I took out the spen it was a lightsaber powering on and when I put it away it was a lightsaber powering down. It was awesome. 
samsung will never swap you device under the warranty, it's parts replacing warranty. which you can pay for in stores
Give this a look. [http://www.samsung.com/us/smart-switch/](http://www.samsung.com/us/smart-switch/)Also check out the Sync iTunes to Android app in the Play Store.For contact, definitely use Google Contacts and have them sync over to your phone automatically.
Might be a factor, although many people tell me I keep my brightness way too low (around where you've got yours, give or take a couple pixels). It really depends what type of light I'm using my phone in. Seriously though, your SOT is amazing. Congratulations. I want to be like you when I grow up
I guess we just keep signing up for these and see what sticks? I've already signed up for the original wireless charger promo, then the $5payment option, I wonder will they just keep letting us sign up since it doesn't really say unless you're already done a previous promo right?
Does N920c work in USA? I've heard some international editions don't get samsung pay or have issues w/video calling or texting. Also could anyone help explain to me how they get updated to marshmallow in the future?
Attempting to send this message back in time. It is worth the wait! 
Absolute shit? I've never heard of the ones you mentioned so I'll check them out but that's a little harsh for Sketchbook Express. Why do you hate it so much?
Yeah, it was terribly worded, sorry. I guess my main point is I have a lot of scratches all over my screen. Has anyone else had issues with this? It's just shocking to me that my screen would be so scratched considering all phones have Gorilla Glass 4, which is supposed to be Damn near scratch proof. I haven't had any scratches on my screen since my first smartphone. Suddenly I've noticed my N5 has a lot of micro scratches all over the screen, including one really noticeable one. It's especially odd because I've never had the phone in a situation to scratch it like this
Sounds like you may have a major issue with your phone. I have never had quick charge not start when I plugged in one of my chargers. By change have you tried another charger. Maybe the charger you have is bad.
No, I use a random cable I found in my house with my wireless charger and it works just fine. Not very fast though. 
Not a chance... It's pretty evident which side you're putting it in...&gtThat's what she said...Even in the event it gets stuck, people have found how to remove it without damaging anything. You just roll a paper sheet, or thin plastic, around the S-Pen and slide it up until it touches the lock mechanism, then push through and the S-Pen is free.
I'd like to find one of the spen holders as well since they are perfectly accurate. But which model feel did you use? Some models don't play nice,  you need the ones specifically made for Samsung devices.  To further the confusion,  Amazon has been known to ship the wrong ones even if you order the Samsung model from them,  the only way to be sure is to order from Wacom's store. 
I have the same problem. I woke up this morning and I can not fast charge at all. Not only that it seems my phone stops charging at random points. This morning it was 50% after charging all night. This afternoon it only charged to 86%. Super upset :/
Dang man everyone got like 2 or 3. I checked my claim status and they say my email isn't registered. 
Does these issues only happen over wifi?
I just recently started to get those messages as well
Bodyguardz glass screen protector with Ghostek clear rubber case with aluminum frame. Been solid as hell for me.
Really? Hmm I've just read things online, and obviously in the past with other Samsung phones, seems like the start to lag with each update and each passing month. 
In case you still don't have the update, the Samsung Experience Shops should now have the latest Note 5 update available for your device. Stores may have to force it to download if their computer hasn't already downloaded it already.
Do you have any info to back up this sd card slot on the Gear Vr? I just did a general search about the sd card slot and it was a rumor that was never confirmed. It would be great if this were true. 
Try the app Finger Security on the App store, locks whatever app you want with fingerprints registered on the phones settings. pretty neat. Try some themes and look at 'galaxy apps', they have apps specifically for galaxies and deals for the note 5. e.g. 2 month subscription to quickflix. 
brighter colours and long screen on times definitely hurt oled screens. that being said, I had a gnex for almost 2 years, and Samsung phones since the note 4 and haven't had burn in. it's either a defective device or you're using your phone a considerable amount. may I ask what you normally do on your phone? 
Right, but lollipop was more of a design and back end overhaul, tons of things have changed with 6.0. New permissions model, certain guidelines OEM have to stick to. Not to mention Samsung Pay, I don't think they'd release marshmallow without a properly compatible version. 
Location plus bad signal is normally the cause. I thought I would just point that out. I don't do anything special and get SOT of 5 hours so I figured I'd point out the obvious before people start suggesting programs like greenify lol
I would contact DBrand about the fit.  They usually go above and beyond for their customers, and would probably solve your issues with an email.
You don't need package disabler. Look into that in a few months when you're an advanced user. Must have app: Nova Launcher. First thing I install on every phone. It'll change the way your home screen looks and makes it super customizable. 
Well... Eff that. Lol. I can wait a few more days for the update, hopefully that'll fix the issue 
I used this [waterproof case](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0176JFX4U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&ampqid=1451308312118&ampsr=8-1&ampkeywords=waterproof+case) to take underwater photos with my iPhone 6 plus (5.5) while snorkeling in Oahu. The case was completely waterproof and I was able to take photos through the case. The case did not block my ability to swipe the iPhone screen or use the camera. There was no leakage at all.
If its like the code I got with the wireless charger you just use it in the promo / coupon code part of check out. The link just takes you to their store
Ugh I hate this battery percent and time on the notification bar. Any idea how to remove them. Tried darthstalker liked it but like a.deodexed stock more. 
I'm having the same problem. If I leave my phone off the charger over night it depletes the battery by around 30% with Android System using around 40% of the battery life and cell standby is using a lot also. I had a Note 5 a while back and I was getting 6.5 hours of screen on time with it. I briefly switched away to an iPhone and back to a Note 5 last week. I thought the new Note was defective after how good of battery life I was getting on my previous one. I exchanged it and am already having exactly the exact same issue on the new one. Honestly, I'm pretty disappointed at this point and I'm seriously considering going back to a 6S Plus. I don't feel like I should have to disable services and apps just to get decent battery life.
Quick note?
If it's not hiding on a home screen (it was for me) go to your widgets and find Galaxy Apps. It has gifts and essentials, which all have some really cool offerings. That's how I found it at least, there may be a better way. It was completely by accident, but a very good accident :)
where can i find such recovery tools?
Same as you it all started a few days ago when my phone updated I have not found a fix for it yet either. Phone is 100% stock I have not rooted or done any modifications. I've clear cache, factory reset,  and I even use Samsung smart switch to reinstall the OS. Happens randomly and only a reboot fixes it.
No, but eventually I found on forums that it's a more complicated issue than Google thought and is going to take time to fix. In the meantime YouTube works for me, especially since the play service comes with YouTube red service (still a stupid name). Not as convenient as just having your music player play the music you want but better than nothing. I have the 7.99 a month early adopter price which I'll lose if I cancel so I'm probably not going to cancel my service over this. 
I don't have a battery icon option in settings to turn off the battery percent on the notifications. On the custom roms I installed I was able to turn it off but on stock rom I cannot. Is there anyway to kill that with an xposed app?
It's a f$%#ing virtual reality headset! It's the best way to showcase the amazing screen on your phone, and it's the best way to get your iPhone peasant friends back on track when they see the power of Android.Just kidding^(Well, not really...)Fool around with a new technology that's gonna be big in the years to come, experience 3D videos and 3D photos to show your trips to family and friends. I like being an early adopter. I bought a LG G Watch back in August 2014 (when it had a $5sale at Telus -- *only* cost me $200). Then I saw a couple other smartwatches popping around. I've been asked millions of times about my ~~iWatch~~ ~~Apple Watch~~ smartwatch. It's nice to try new technologies as they appear, so you can follow the evolution.
im currently on a trip and consistently seeing battery drain from leaving location on 
Offscreen notes are action memos. To set a reminder from an off screen note, you need to open it in s-note. 
Would having AT&ampT unlock the device fix that? I just bought an AT&ampT note 5 today and could return it within 14 days to buy an international unlocked version for the same price if I need to.
Don't have a note 5 yet but this has happened to me with my galaxy s6 edge. I was thinking about switching to a note 5 but this post has me paranoid again.I too haven't had a screen protector since gorilla glass became the norm and this is my first time that I have seen a scratch on a phone. I couldn't believe it when i saw it, and it definitely pissed me off.Hopefully more people can chime in..EDIT: I just came back from the t-mobile store to check out the v1and note 5...the note 5 had noticeable hairline scratches on the screen just like my s6...don't know anymore this is frustrating
The predictions is really good (after I turned off some setting that relied on social media. Something like that). Themes are nice. The ability to customize certain settings such as long press duration and what not is really nice. Just an all around solid keyboard that hasn't failed me yet. 
Bank of america andriod app works with the fingerprint scanner as a log in, so that's pretty cool. But ya just get a chase card 
I just went from the Note 4 to the Note 5 about a month ago. If you don't absolutely need the removable battery and SD card, the Note 5 is far superior than the Note 4. Battery life is about the same for me (T-Mo), but the Note 5 fast charging is crazy fast. The screen, S-Pen, feel / ergonomics, software, camera, and (at least in my case) GPS are all far superior on the Note 5. This is the first phone in 2 years that I haven't rooted and ROM'd. I'd say go for the Note 5. It's worth the extra cost.
Ahhhh yes that's true! I'll have to take a look at that. Is it better on the battery than Android Device Manager? 
I would take 2light scratches over a screen protector any day of the week. I think I had one or two light scratches on my Note 4, and it was only visible when the display is off. So what?
I had never heard of pressy before. Thanks for informing me about another option especially since I almost never use a headphone jack
I have the Samsung wireless charger as well as [this much cheaper one](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NWMI07S?keywords=wireless%20charger&ampqid=1451350554&ampref_=sr_1_4&amps=wireless&ampsr=1-4). The cheap one is much more reliable than the Samsung which seems really picky about placement (and will work for a little while then just stop). I don't know about charging speed, but they both charge relatively quickly. I'm more of a keep-it-full than a rapid charge from 5% kinda guy.As for screen protectors, they're not necessary for everyone. I haven't used a screen protector in years. My Galaxy S4 screen is still flawless after years of use and my Note 5 is flawless after ~4 months. Don't drop it, keep it out of your keys pocket, and don't throw it in a bag with sand - you will be flawless forever. IMO if you drop frequently you're better off buying a case made to handle it than wasting money on a screen protector. Just because a tempered glass screen protector breaks doesn't mean it saved your phone - it broke because it's tempered glass not gorilla glass. Your phone's glass is much stronger than the cheap little protector. 
New on the Note 5 and Edge+
lol I totally forgot it existed. I doubt anyone cared enough to buy it,. Anyone who really wants the keyboard probably is buying or bought the Blackberry Priv.
Another issue besides size:  some of the older sims couldn't do LTE.  But either way a new sim should be free or a trivial amount of money.
I used Swipe Up Home Button, first to access the settings menu, then I downloaded an app to switch between the last 2 recent apps. It is amazing how it feels to multitask now.[Swipe Home Button](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.matthewma.swipehomebuttonfree&amphl=en)Then go to bindings , which is where you will change what each swipe does, and use custom app shortcut for this app[Last App Switcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.abhi.lastappswitcher&amphl=en) This app allows you to swipe up from home and switch from the two recents. This is just an example of what you could do. Or you could try this [Settings Shortcut](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.MirusApplications.settingsshortcut&amphl=en).Hope this helps!
Yeah, I thought the same thing. Really strange, since it's just a weird magnet system that makes the button work, not actually electronics and a battery like say the Apple Pencil. Still not $99 though, lol...
If you ask the 6P sub, their Touchwiz circlejerk hate there is appalling.  I've noticed people in this subreddit are much nicer and a lot more fair than the pure Android camp.  I've used both stock: Nexus S 4G, Nexus 5, OnePlus One, and Moto G 4G and Samsung devices: Epic 4G, Note 1, Note 2, Note 4, and Note 5 and TBH I actually prefer the features of the Note 5 over bare bones stock or near stock.  Even when I used to flash ROMS, I still preferred TW on my Note 1 and Epic 4G over stock ROMS like CM.  Sure it gets shot down for the looks and sometimes (at least before) in throwing every feature kitchen sink into TW, but they have really cleaned up TW a lot with less, but better, features and toned down the design.  I like the direction TW has been heading to lately.
Same thing happened, is happening to me. Check my history. I had a post in here about it a week or so ago (sorry for lack of an update guys). Anyway, I talked to Samsung and had it shipped off. It is currently being worked on with an expected completion date of Nov 12. So I hope you have a spare phone. Just a note, take pictures of your phone before sending it in. Samsung has a thing on their site where you can track the different repair status' they're doing, and literally just a few minutes ago I checked it and it said scratches on lcd. Dude. There were NO scratches on that thing when I sent it off. Pristine condition. I packed it for shipping nicely as well. I'd be super pissed if it came back scratched up. Also. I was the first I could find with the problem, now that I'm seeing more people with it, will this end up being a big deal with everybody's pen eventually wearing out this quickly? I wonder. 
pull down each box with 2 fingers at the same time to expand them
I guess you did say no effect on phone speed, lag, or performance which technically doesn't include haptic feedback.  How does your Pebble affect battery life?  I have the new Steel Time and love it, but anytime the watch and phone aren't near each other, the battery life really goes to shit on my S6.  
You have to sign in to your Google account as it does the live broadcast through YouTube. 
Go into your phone settings and into themes.  The material Dark theme is good. It changes the appearance of the OS and all Samsung apps
Get rid of any extra apps you have that run in the background. I work for a cellphone company and people come in all the time with their phones under preforming because a bunch of apps are running that take up a colossal amount of their RAM. I'd try to keep your phone as stock as possible if you want really good performance, that or get rid of all the apps that run 24/7
I miss the rear volume controls and the finger-scroll to get to the top of a page on the LGG2. I'm always hitting the volume buttons on the Note5 by mistake. Also, when I use the S-pen, I always hit the little button. That said, I have no regrets in buying this phone and would still do so again after 7 weeks of use. 
Yep. Both the active digitizer and wireless charger send power by magnetic induction, so having such a strong magnet near the coils interferes with their function. 
Not a big phone repair guy, but if there isn't any visible damage, I'd guess you've got some loose connectors up by the earpiece.https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Samsung+Galaxy+Note5+Teardown/51083I'd guess it's going to be a pain in the ass to do it yourself. If you can find someone that will repair Note 5s, go for it... But you might want to see what Samsung can do. Sounds like a high degree of difficulty repair.
I've tried connecting my phone to Windows 1laptop but it won't show up. Even after installing the drivers from the Samsung website. 
FYI, You can't use samsung pay/android pay if you are rooted.  and especially with Samsung Pay/KNOX once you trip it there's no going back.  Think carefully before rooting.  Other than for some limited ROM version/method.  rooting majority of the time will trip KNOX
You know, it also depends on how you use the phone. Some apps cause the OS to drain the battery more than others. (The Facebook app, for instance, will murder it). Just keep tinkering around with yours settings till you get it to work for you. Another thing? Do you know how to import XML files into Package Disabler?
When I got my wireless charging pad I never got confirmation, just randomly showed up in a UPS box one day just like that. I'd say wait a little longer i'm sure you (we) will get what we signed up for
Samsung offered a $10gift card code to their online store for those who registered a compatible card with Samsung Pay. The promo was offered through the 9th.Now, they offer a $20code if you buy a new device and register a card.
the Fast version have vents on the bottom and got a min(quiet) fan internally to help with heat, the normal none fast charge version does not have vent at the bottom, you can see that in the side profile pictures.  There are also fake on ebay/amazon so be careful when the vendor is an uknown
Headphones? What headphones? I'm on Verizon and I didn't get anything other than the basic accessories :(
Yeah I shared an XML file with the bloat list in it recently you can check my history for it.  I've tinkered a ton with my settings and I was getting excellent battery life.  I usually just browse Reddit on relay pro.  Some calls texts light navigation and music.  I got over 8hrs sot and about 0.5% battery drain per hour while idle.  I would only lose 4% over night.
Also with Verizon here.. Can confirm did not receive earphones
Give moboclean a try. It cleans apps and reinstalls them thereby giving you more control over them. You can block their wifi access or internet access. You can also stop them from starting up, or have them shut down after a certain period of inactivity. I used to use greenify when my old phone was rooted, but it kind of sucks with the non-rooted version. This works pretty well. I wouldn't use it on any important apps though (although I haven't had any issues yet).
Lol I just looked at mine and the film is on the flash but not the lense.
I'm really happy with my Zagg tempered glass screen protector. It feels like there is nothing on it. The s pen works fine. 
I don't really like a fancy blingy smartwatch so I'm plenty happy with my Pebble Time. BUT if I had to pick up a Android Wear watch I would stay the Hwatch or Moto 362015. I would stay away from the Gear s2. No google features and in typical Samsung fashion. It'll stop getting updates after a year. But for me my pebble time is the best $13I've spent so far.
So when's our update? 
I never use cases but I have to say I'm always careful with my phones , I bent to check something under my car the other day and &amp my note5 fell out of my blazers inner pocket , it landed on the it's face on the asphalt , not a single scratch!! I guess I was lucky but still very impressing.
I've had mine since they released and it's just now getting sticky on my power and volume down buttons
It's a theme I'm using with klwp. The top part doesn't move. The bottom swipes between apps and calendar. The theme is called pinkmotion, with my own twist.
Difference between a data cable and a 2v rated cable or a charger rated for less then 2v. Is the most common culprit, after that I'd check the cable and try a different charger
Get Package Disabler Pro and disable the bloat.  Can dramatically improve battery life.  I went from having to keep battery saver on all day to having ~30% left at night with battery saver off when I disabled all the crap I don't use.
I already got the case but was approved for the $10samsung.com credit. Not sure what to get, Already have fast wireless charger, gearvr, and gear s2. Was leaning towards either another charger or the keyboard cover, or both. 
Had a Spigen case which saved my phone when I dropped it onto concrete. Case was full of scuffs and dents. Really grateful for it for having saved me hundred of dollars worth of repairs (or worse, needing to replace it had it become unusable). I've since retired it and got a UAG, and this one's even beefier. I'd recommend getting a protective case and maybe a tempered glass thing for your screen.
Screenwise Panel is a Google app that basically pays you for the opportunity to peek your browsing habits.  That's what was causing all my random restarts.  Once I uninstalled it, my restarts stopped completely.  It may be an app you downloaded.  Think about what apps you downloaded around the time it started and uninstall all of them, then slowly add them back so you can pinpoint which it is.  
I believe you are able to use LTE on the N920.
See the Lifehacker article I linked below. There is some drawback to leaving your phone on the charger overnight, but it's not an issue of overheating. Fast chargers taper off to a trickle well before you reach 100%, and the phone will stop charging once it reaches max charge regardless. The issue is that your phone is always using power and will sip from the charger throughout the night, which stresses the battery.That said, the marginal difference in battery life is almost certainly miniscule. I've charged every phone I've ever owned overnight. The only reason I was reluctant to do so with the Note 5 is that, like you, I was a little paranoid about its overheating. As I explained above, however, that concern is probably misplaced. 
I have one of the Tech21 wallet cases. Not sure how well it protects against drops, but the flip cover makes it so I don't worry about having my phone in the same pocket as my keys or lighter. Fairly thin as well. Have access to volume and power buttons with it closed. Only thing I don't like is the S pen is kinda hard to get out. Also, doesn't work with wireless charging. But, it is easy to take off and put on. At home I remove the case. https://www.tech21.com/en_us/evo-wallet-case-for-samsung-galaxy-note-5
Timely as well.   Very nice if you have multiple devices or wipe your  device.  reinstall and all alarms come back
The very best feature of Nova for me is the swipe up on icons function. You literally cut the number of icons on your homescreen in half. You need Nova Prime and you can activate this by long pressing on any icon and pressing on edit. You can then change the swipe action field to your liking. Some examples: * Hangouts icon: press to load hangouts, swipe up to load hangouts dialer * another icon: press to load Podcast Addict, swipe up to load audible* More complex task for an icon: press to load Sbrowser, swipe up to load two sbrowser windows in multi-window mode (note that the latter is done using an app called MW-Shortcurts. It allows homescreen icons to load multi-window recipes. What Nova does in this example, is that it actually runs MW-Shortcut upon swiping up on the browser icon, which in turn runs the multi-window instance). I can provide more detail tutorial if you'd like.

OneNote with the S-Pen lacks some features that I would like to see (I would like to be able to erase by pressing the button on the pen, for example), but overall, it's awesome.  It got me through this semester of college.When I got my Note 5, I stopped taking my laptop and notebook to class because OneNote on my Note 5 was a good enough substitute for both of them.  Then, I could review the notes I took on my phone later on a bigger screen since it syncs to my laptop.  I would use Office Lens to take pictures of the PowerPoint presentations if there was a graph or something and just import the pictures into the notebook.I think it will serve your purposes.
Interestingly, I didn't see Security patch level, so I checked for an update. A 45mb update was available, so I installed it. Now it says security patch level 2015-11-1.
Nova Launcher for maximum customization.
I have a Spigen Slim Armor with a tempered glass screen protector and have fitment issues. 
Do you smoke? Have any lung diseases (chronic or acute)? Live in a high pollution area? Severe allergies? Work near any volatile/inhalable toxins? Snore at night and are measuring SpO2 when you get up? If none of these apply, make sure nothing is between your finger and the sensor. SpO2 is measured through light absorption. Many chemicals (such as nail polish, pen-ink, etc) can interfere with the reading.
It doesn't support split-screen, but it supports the popup/window mode. Hit Recents, then long-press on the Phone app card. Or another way, from within the Phone app, drag one of the top corners of the app toward the center of the screen like you're resizing a window.
How are you liking it? Is the camera glass poking through still? Thinking about getting a skin or this case..
Other people have reported that it supports micro sd card. The micro sd card slot maybe tied together with the sim tray like the [Z3+](http://www.etradesupply.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/057e9a6874558f3662d2f35513464147/r/e/replacement_part_for_sony_xperia_z3_sim_and_sd_card_tray_-_a_grade_2_.jpg)
Well, I was referring to the lack of removable battery.  I'm not sure how well it'll work, but since I don't constantly use my phone...I assume it'll be OK. 
I'm switching to Sprint and got a notification that mine had shipped. Went to pick it up and they told me that they couldn't give it to me until release day. :(
I've asked myself those same questions and at the end of the day there's an element of wanting the newest and best looking one.not to mention Samsung pay and much better software support and optimization. It doesn't hurt that I have jump on demand and it won't cost anything upfront to get it.
Very pissed. Haven't even upgraded from my Note 3 to anything else yet and I don't even see this as the best option for myself. This forced package kind of thing is exactly the reason I never went iPhone and it's hilarious it's coming to that. I really appreciate being able to upload media from any of my microSD card compatible devices and upload with just a few seconds of downtime to swap out the card and copy the media over requiring much less energy from both devices via BT, WiFi, or NFC. Makes it very easy for me to share such media on the fly. Plus, we all know that batteries degrade in quality over time, why would we have a more performance demanding phone that probably only marginally is more efficient? this still becomes a means for weaker battery life. Plus, what if I wanted to go for a long trip where charging wouldn't be easy, or even desireable? Now I'll need a bunch of bogus battery packs instead of multiple batteries, or just a huge aftermarket battery I can trust to get a days of life off of. I'm really amazed at how much of their market they're throwing under the rug.
Let's see how scroll capture works. http://imgur.com/0407KILI don't think that's for every Note5 owner but that's crap I don't use. 
In the past year I have had a 6 and a 6 plus and now I have the note 5, I didn't come directly from one to the other but have had experience with both, the only disappoint I would say coming from the iPhone to this is music intagration, of course the company that started as an ipod manufacturer would do music right. But since apple music that seems to have started to go down hill, I miss being able to plug my iPhone into anything with a USB port and it will play the music well. That's about all I can think of, everything else the note seems to top. It's possible that the note might not have as good standby time since the iPhone is great at that, but I haven't had the note long enough to be sure about that yet 
It only does 4k 30fps and slomo 120fps
Dramatic over statement. My wife's old iPhone 4 is so old and the battery is fine. Relax dude. 
What app do you use?  I've noticed some reddit apps drain battery more than others.  And chrome browsing reddit, you might as well plug in now.   
I guess I'll be returning the phone then.  My S5 had screen on time of 8+ hours and sometimes would last 3 days on a single charge.  Not even getting 4 hours of screen on time it too little for me.I went to bed last night with    54%, woke up to 9% battery and 52% of my battery was cell standby. This is worse than any phone I've ever had. 
nah, it's harder than no case but i likeit since my pen would pop sometimeswithouta case.I hate cases generally but I really love this one
Reported the issue to Blizzard's Support, as I think this is a bug with the app not the phonehttp://us.battle.net/en/forum/topic/18710643764#1
You can also use palm swipe to capture feature under settings/motions and gestures or the good old volume down and power buttons at the same time.
This requires a rooted kernel and deodexed Rom, I recommend flashing the newest version of the ROM, then flashing the Arter kernel (better than the one built into the ROM) and then xposed on top of that. Everything running flawlessly on the T-Mobile Note 5. Most modules for 64bit Samsung lollipop are still experimental (huge changes in how everything runs) so if you want to find a module, go through xda and you should be able to find test builds. 
&gt but I live a very rushed lifestyle and I have had to put the SPen back into place in a rush more than once, and this could have happened to me had I not paid attention.And yet it never did, which contradicts your assertion of just how easy it is, no?
I ordered the Note 5 but ended up changing my mind and getting the S6 Edge+. I just love how the screen wraps around the edges with practically no bezels. Also, I didn't use the S pen enough with my Note 3 to be swayed by the extra functionality. While it does cost $10more for the S6 Edge+, I think it's definitely worth it. I use my phone more than any other item in my day-to-day life. An extra $10is insignificant if I'm sure I will have no regrets, and be overall happier with the Edged phone.
Using this magnet in your case is going to prevent you from using Samsung Pay. It will interfere with the magnetic pulses the phone generates to make payments at regular credit card terminals. I tested with LoopPay and a magnet attached to the back does prevent transactions from going through.
I'd be fine getting the Note 5, I mainly just wanted to know what the opinion of N5/Edge+ compared to the Note 4 would be. It doesn't matter so much that I was interested in the Edge, I just wanted to know if the upgrade from the 4 was worth it. :)
No games, pure black background, reddit sync pro with amoled night mode on. This phone is worse than my s6.
All of our bank/credit cards look something like [this](http://www.bmo.com/img/main/credit-cards/large/airmiles-card.jpg). To pay you can either tap your card on the reader for stuff up to $100, or insert you card's chip in a slot and enter your 4 digit pin to verify the purchase. Most machines won't accept the mag strip unless the chip+pin entry didn't work after 3 tries. It's a lot more secure than just swiping the mag strip, and when I went down to the States for the first time a few months ago it was very strange to just swipe my card without having to even sign anything.
Update: the top of the pen got lodged in the phone and would not come out. Went back to T-Mobile and they said that's not covered by the warranty. But they were kind enough to give me a replacement, thank the lord!
S View case is pretty sweet and doesn't interfere with the slim bezel area.
I have 3 Samsung wireless charging pads and they all do this... Very annoying. 
I'm on T-Mobile and one of the stickers on the side of the box was already peeled. Didn't bother to ask T-Mobile if it was supposed to be this way because it looked fine at the time, but now I am noticing a small bubble under the bottom right corner of the glass (above the S-Pen).
&gt Haidinger's BrushI have a similar yellow as well.  My iPhone 6 was way more noticable.  I think I can live with the 'yellow' on this screen.  It's subtle and not the worst.
This is in no way, shape, or form a viable substitute for a removable battery. I appreciate the joke though. 
Dammit. Why does it even say glass then
That is actually a real possibility.  This year's note is getting a limited release so it doesn't take away from the edge plus marketshare.  Between that and various minor hardware shortcomings that will drive note users to other phones, if the 2015 Note doesn't sell well, next year they might just call it a galaxy S7 plus and ditch the stylus.
No, you can put it in with the Samsung logo facing up or down, just don't put the pen in clicky part first. 
I'm 99% sure it's plastic but I'm not an expert. It feels very nice to me :)
I'm just running the stock ROM, I knew nothing about getting a deodexed rom, how do I do that?Sorry for the dumb questions, my only experience with rooting was towelroot on the Note 3, and nothing ever came for the Note 4 for verizon. 
so weird.  Bought a case and a screen protector on amazon and i'm super paranoid about it now.  
I used it with the Samsung clear case without any problem. I think the only problem would be with cases that have metal on the back or if you have one of those metal plates on the back for a magnetic holder. That would more than likely reduce or disrupt the magnetic pulses the phone generates.
Yeah it all came out in one piece for me so it just looked like a damaged spen or hardware failure so I got it exchanged on the spot 
What can you do if after the pen is out the device no longer recognizes it is removed. Slip it in and out and it still thinks it's in there 
I agree with most of the article accept the statement Let me just say that your Galaxy Unpacked 2015 event on Thursday, August 13th in NYC was a huge hit. I know Samsung catches a lot of shit from taking cues from Apple, but this event could have really used some Apple presentation flair. They really should have taken the time to demo some of the exciting new functionality on stage. SideSync, for example, would have made an excellent demo (especially if it was running on a mac). I didn't learn until I watched reporter recordings of the post event side sync demo that I could leverage it to respond to texts and make calls from my computer. That's the one feature of Apple's continuity that I've really been missing.Or what about the improvement multipliers that Apple loves to throw in their slides. Samsung could have communicated key metrics like x times faster processor, x times more efficient processor, x times better battery life. Why they wouldn't take an opportunity to sell us on their new products baffles me.So in addition to you cannot please everyone, I would also tell Samsung to add quite a heaping dose of spice and excitement to their launch events.EDIT: No surprise, here come the down votes.

Same. My phone radio is like 30% on gsam
Hi thanks for your reply. What I like about the Samsung Multimedia Smart Dock, which has 3 usb ports and an HDMI connection is that I can use my Note 3 like a mini computer. I was hoping I could do the same with the Note 5. I tried fitting my Note 5 into the smart dock on several occasions now and it does not fit, which is strange given what you have experienced. I will go to Best Buy later today and see if I need to finesse it into the smart dock but I really don't think it will work.If anyone is interested, here is the Samsung multimedia smart dock (originally created for the Note 2 but works with the Note 3 and 4 as well):http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Smart-Multimedia-Active/dp/B009QW3TBKDemo - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCPCY9PSfSkHere is the regular dock:http://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-multimedia-dock-for-select-samsung-galaxy-cell-phones/7278136.p?id=1218838640617&ampThanks for the info btw!
Did it break your pen sensor? Others said their phones no longer detected the pen as being in or out of the phone
I saw that but thanks! I called Samsung and they said that the Chromecast is a good cheap option.
My note 4 was considerably laggier than my five. I feel like the multi tasking perform better. 
cheers Thanks. I read it yesterday that Verizon had it for $8532GB model. But i just checked their website and it listed as $696. Also sorry for the mis-information.
The Note 5 sold in Taiwan is model [N9208](http://pdadb.net/index.php?m=specs&ampid=8727&ampc=samsung_sm-n9208_galaxy_note_5_td-lte_64gb_samsung_noble). It supports the following networks:*GSM850, GSM900, GSM1800, GSM1900, UMTS85(B5), UMTS90(B8), UMTS190(B2), UMTS210(B1), LTE210(B1), LTE70(B17), LTE85(B5), LTE1700/210(B4), LTE180(B3), LTE260(B7), LTE190(B2), LTE190(B25), LTE70(B12), LTE80(B26), TD-LTE260(B38), TD-LTE250(B41), TD-LTE230(B40), TD-LTE190(B39), LTE70(B28)*This model supports LTE TDD frequencies used in mainland China, in addition to FDD LTE frequencies used in most other countries. Check to see which LTE bands your carrier supports.The most popular site for buying electronics in Taiwan is [Ruten](http://www.ruten.com.tw), but since you are not Taiwanese (and you don't speak Chinese), eBay will probably be your best option.Edit: the other model you may want to purchase is [N920i](http://pdadb.net/index.php?m=specs&ampid=8687&ampc=samsung_sm-n920i_galaxy_note_5_td-lte_samsung_noble), which is the international model sold in many countries. It supports the following networks:*GSM850, GSM900, GSM1800, GSM1900, UMTS85(B5), UMTS90(B8), UMTS190(B2), UMTS210(B1), LTE210(B1), LTE70(B17), LTE85(B5), LTE1700/210(B4), LTE180(B3), LTE260(B7), LTE190(B2), LTE80(B18), LTE90(B8), LTE70(B12), LTE80(B26), LTE80(B19), TD-LTE230(B40), LTE70(B28)*The N920i supports FDD LTE bands 8 and 19 which the N9208 does not support.
&gtNexus devices have removable batteries and SD slots.LOLNo. &gtHTC one has an IR blaster (SD slot maybe?)And notification pull down ads, enjoy that. 
The bump (lip) is going to be present on the Caseology too - and since I don't have both cases, I can't compare which lip is bigger. Like I said, the lip helps protect the screen, so you want a lip, it's a drawback of cases in general.Also, compared to the price of the phone, these cases are dirt cheap why not grab a few and pick the one you like best after trying them? I'm waiting on a couple more cases to arrive - I ordered some with credit card holders for when Samsung Pay goes live (I'm optimistically thinking of ditching my wallet)
Great video. I pray to the old gods and the new Samsung doesn't kill the Note line. The Note 5 is a rebranded S6 with a stylus. I want a Note. 
I love how the clock widget doesn't work and the alarm clock functionality is bloated garbage. All stock. Default solutions don't work, must construct sloppy web of 3rd party garbage. 
Biggest complaints are battery life, speed/responsiveness, and storage space. I am on my third note battery and am probably due for a 4th, so I like the replaceable feature of the 4. Both the 4 and 5 will be huge upgrades in speed and responsiveness, so I'm not to worried about that. Storage space is way bigger in the 4. I can't see any logical reason to choose the 5 over the 4, other than maybe looks and the new s pen features. 
I pre-ordered 64 GB White Note 5. Pretty excited after being able to play with the display one at best buy. Plus best buy gives out a free wireless charger :D with it. I'm a Windows Phone user and moving to Android so it will be an interesting change. My friends and family members all use Android and honestly no matter how devote I am to Windows, Android just seems to have way more in entertainment value and apps.It is annoying how people continuously leave negative remarks and try to persuade people in not buying the note 5 just because it doesn't have SD card and removable battery. Thing is these users could just buy another phone. Nobody is holding a gun to their heads nor did Samsung promise them anything. 
It charges so fast this is not an issue for me. You can get a fast charging battery bank for it as well. For me, putting a wireless charger on my desk and one in my car is enough to keep it charged up throughout the day without any worries. Though, I'm looking forward to getting a wireless fast charger.
I'd get the Note 5 but I use the IR blaster frequently. Lack of it is enough for me to not buy the Note 5. I was so excited to upgrade. I don't know what to do now. 
As /u/sarxion said, if you stick to the Play store and don't install shady shit, you're fine.  
I don't think Samsung will have trouble finding customers who want to use Samsung Pay. Samsung Pay is accepted almost everywhere. Google Wallet/Android Pay is not.
Kinda off topic but I wanted to get the wall and car charger, but the code doesn't apply when i put in both. It's either one.
Awesome, thanks a lot. I ordered 1 of each (car, wall, and battery pack). :)
It's an issue, but the seriousness depends on your preferences.  It was bad enough on the S6 for me that I sold my S6 (would only let about 3 apps be open, opening a 4th would make one drop out of RAM and need to reload).  It's definitely better in the Note 5, I can have 7-9 apps open in RAM without apps needing to reload (depending on if one of them is a browser).  While not perfect, this works fine for my needs as I usually need to switch between 4-5 apps (which made the S6 a deal breaker). 
What apps are running?   Do you have your phone doing anything unnecessary like scanning for bluetooth,  WiFi,  gps, etc, when you aren't using the phone? 
Mine was really bad at first but after a few days it seems to have settled down. The only part its still kind of bad on is the very bottom of the phone, off the screen. I bought the one they're carrying at the T-Mobile corporate stores, I believe it's the PureGear Glass.I don't use a case though, so YMMV. 
You'll get no argument from me that it should have been something Samsung caught during design. I'm just saying that people are acting like victims, and they aren't. 
Both on the same carrier. I will post a screens hot later today. I turned on power saver mode at around noon. Today has been more of the same though. I was at 90% by the time I got to work at 8:45 whereas my iPhone would be around 98-100. It's currently 1pm and I'm at 75% 
Water damage is not something phones are exposed every second you use it, misplacement is. You are sounding like Samsung's version of an iSheep by ignoring what you want to ignore just because it doesn't happen to you.
I didn't miss it. I have the latest firmware on my note 4 as well. You may not see or feel the difference but I do when I started comparing the two in my hands at the same time... As far as the opening apps faster I will link a video when I get home. It's actually a video showing the issues with the n5 killing apps in the background but it also shows the n5 still opening the apps faster than all of the competition. They did not use Samsung apps in the competition. 
Check out google music. you can upload up to 50k tracks for free and stream them from wifi/mobile data or save them to your phone
Yeah I know what you're saying, but just to be clear, I'm not putting anything on the phone itself. It sticks to the magnetic mount because it has metal inside the phone. :)
External Otg usb keys and Aukey quick charge 2.External battery 10000Mah
It's pretty awesome the lens can focus on things so close to it, but I still wouldn't keep any of those pictures with such a big amount of noise.
Right now I'm trying to figure out if its worth getting this phone on ATT Next or a 2 year contract. I am upgrading my phone.
Turn off location history and set location to power saving. That might help. 
Its a bit funny because the reason why Samsung probably changed their design was because selling to the power user was actually causing them to lose sales. It just wasn't profitable for them. Most power users I know seem to stay with the same Note 3/4 or even the Note 2 because they are unwilling to even upgrade because no matter what Samsung adds they feel the upgrades are so minimal and bring nothing new to their device that they won't even think about upgrading. From what I've seen especially from reading angry Note 4 and below user posts who call themselves Power Users are actually a bunch of people who seem so cheap and willing to cling to old, slow tech just to not spend any money at all. There is no perfect phone for these users so why bother try to cater to them?Samsung are now fishing different markets to see how they can do there. I'm honestly pleased with the new design.
How do I change the color of my Google search bar?
I would be devastatingly surprised if it did not have a micro SD slot. The removable battery I can live without, but please have a SD!
That is exactly what they are going to do.  The new colors will come along later.
It's not a bug, they changed what the numbers mean since Lollipop.
Im with Rogers in Canada and they are offering that same charging device free of charge with any preorder of the Note 5. I would never buy one by itself but hey, they're giving it away.Sorry to burst your bubble but I am not aware of any other device that has the same capabilities... 
Did you ever play a game where it was like the developer programmed it, but never played it himself? That is the note 5 
It's not that it's bad practice, once I bought an additional battery for my Note 4, it was a complete game changer. I never have my phone plugged in. Ever. 
We will have to watch the field between now and Christmas, which is the usual frenzy season. The current suspects with MicroSD support are Xperia Z series, Note 4/Edge, Huawei Honor 6 Plus and possibly the upcoming Huawei Nexus along with the LG. There is a high-end group out of China LeTV who have the Max which has a 21mp camera and other hot items. Although the MicroSD card is a no-go I think.  But it does have Dual Sims and a truckload of other goodies.  The only way to get the attention of these manufacturers is to show them by our absence at the cash register that we will not be bullied into buying under-spec'd overpriced premium phones. 
I don't due to the fact that it's part of AT&ampT and Verizon policy that they don't want rooted phones on their network... Plus Apple is fully against jailbreaking... just as they are trying to stop it... iOS 9 new security, Apple is calling rootlessThey both are trying to stop being able to access system partition.rooting and jailbreaking is not the same as unlocking... unlocking is using the phone on other carriers (IMEI unlocking) which they allow
I'd love to upgrade my Note II but I can't do that with this phone. No SD card, no removable battery (and actually SMALLER!), no 128GB option.Guess I'm sticking with my Note II and CyanogenMod.Here I am, someone who wants to hand over money to buy this, but I can't, given its limitations.
Is there a macro option in the camera that I'm not seeing?
Verizon is not giving headphones with the note5 like the other carriers are.
I had the same problem with the verizon note. What fixed it for me was turning the phone off and clearing the cache. When the phone is off hold the home, power, and menu button to get the the menu and then scroll down to  wipe cache partition and then reboot it. Then make sure advanced calling is on. 
I have been pretty happy with the Zagg Invisishield HD Glass screen protector on my Note 5.  
Thanks, this seems to be what I was looking for. It works for the most part, though some apps seem to get confused and show the context menu and perform the back functionality simultaneously (QKSMS, at least). I'd still prefer to change the left touch sensor to context menu rather than overload the back button, but I'll work with this for now. Thanks for the tip!
I am backing up all the text to the Samsung account and then im going to just delete them all and see if it helps. Will report back.
That's the thing, how did no one think to stick the pen in backwards just because they can... sorta.
I pre-regged and now the submission sight won't accept my email.  I submitted a support ticket but prizelogic is some of the worse CS ever.   
Verizon was first to market with VoLTE Edit : my mistake you're right. That's weird. If I come across any real tips I'll send them your way. 
32gb base. We are expecting a 64gb and possibly a 128gb. 
Thanks Gregsquatch! Have you also noticed that when taking the pen out while the screen is off, that the bottom right immediately jumps like it detects the pen and then goes away?
I hear ya. I'll need a protector to. I was hoping a glass protector would work well. 
Hardware in the phone tricks old fashioned magnetic card readers into thinking a physical card has been swiped. I can't wait to see how well it works - it is the one feature that helped me get over the pain of the missing IR blaster.
Does it come with different tips for the pen? I switched to the gray tip on my Note 4 and it's wonderfully smooth. When I tried the Note 5 in Best Buy, there was a lot of friction.
I have to admit now I'm curious how you're using a touch screen without looking at it.
If you look at the pen just above the tip there's 2 indents on the sides. It looks like there's some clip that catches that. then the  back end goes past it and can't  release itself from it
I've had no issues so far. I use Hangouts, so no delay from my side. 
That's your wallpaper 
I don't know if I would consider the note 5 processor future proof. Of course it will perform better than the note 4, but they used the same chipset that's in the s6, which has already been out for quite a while. That, combined with the smaller battery, missing IR blaster, and no SD card slot, makes the note 4 a much better value, especially since prices should drop now. I have had the note 2, 3 and 4, and this will be the first new note that I feel I should skip. Hopefully, if sales are low enough, Sammy will learn their lesson and correct all these issues with the note 6.
Don't put this in wrong or you break things should ***never*** happen with an $80piece of equipment.Especially when it can be prevented with the damn near industry standard of keying it so you can't put it in wrong, ***which they had on previous models***.
Doesn't this drain battery?
Advanced calling is off.  The cell standby looks to be using the majority of my battery.
By doing Jump On Demand, you save $72 off the retail price of the phone through bill credits.  Take the year of Netflix code that you get, sell that on eBay for $80.  There's your deal.
Correct, S pen went in halfway and got stuck. I couldn't pull it straight out but kept working it and actually pushed it in further to get it to come out. Afterwards the phone wouldn't recognize when the pen was removed and it was useless from there on out.
Best thing I can think of to compare the weird in-built speaker is [Legion from Mass Effect.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbZcaxULqb4) It's obviously much more subtle than his voice effect, but it becomes more noticeable when audio of people with deep voices plays through it. Even more noticeable at higher volumes.
I'm guessing this is probably going to be like bendgate with the iPhone 6+. The internet freaks out, it's ostensibly a design flaw, but it actually effects a very small fraction of owners.
Yeah, I hope to get rid of touchwiz as soon as possible with this phone.
I wake up in the morning first thing I do is go on social media on my phone and it takes around 1to 15 minutes to drop the first percent when fully charged. Note that my screen brightness is around 30-35% at that time.
Thanks for the advice but CDMA has much better coverage in my area.
I've always had an  iPhone. Started with the 4, 4s, 5, 5s, 6, and 6 Plus. I have tried several times switching to Android. I once tried the Galaxy S4 but  something bothered me so I returned it and got an iPhone. I then tried the Nexus 5 but the battery wasn't on par with my iPhone so I gave it to my mom and got another iPhone. Earlier this month I changed carrier and was able to try a few phones for free with a promotional plan so I tried the Nexus 6 which completely changed how I thought of Android. The experience was simply amazing. I loved the phone and how everything worked but the camera was the worst camera I had ever had on my phones. So I returned it (still having my 6 Plus in hands) and waited for the Note 5. Ive had it since launch date and so far, I would say my experience with this Samsung phone is superior than my experience with the Nexus 6. I'm completely in love with this phone. It's fast, responsive, the camera is the best camera I've ever owned, the screen is the best screen on any smartphone period and the ability to theme touchwiz brings the experience to an entire new level. I found myself tonbe using the S Pen much more than I had expected and so far I have nothing negative to say about the phone. I don't miss anything from my iPhone honestly. I wouldn't go back anytime soon. You can't be disappointed with a Note 5, at least try it. You always get 14 to 3days satisfaction with your carrier anyway so give it a try and I'm pretty sure you'll make the switch. It's much easier than I thought. 
I agree with this. Zagg protectors are a bit more money, but I feel like they're well worth it. My screen protector has zero halo effect and it feels wonderful. I've gone with Zagg for my last few phones and I've never been let down.Plus, there's a Zagg store in my local mall and if anything goes wrong with the screen protector, I just pop in there and get it replaced for free if I'm deemed not at fault and $5 if I did something to damage it. 
 It's not a common or likely occurrence to get burn in on the newer panels, I'd say since the s3. Plus the screen and burn in are covered by warranty. It's not something to be concerned about, personally if be more worried about dead and stuck pixels on an LCD.
Mine just arrived this morning. Plain Back apart from the Samsung logo....and its dual SIM which i was not expecting
My app won't update for some reason... and I was accepted.
You can use ANY 3rd party launcher and still have the S-Pen functionalities intact. I was worried about losing those features, but I decided to try and it still works. Though I do like NOVA Launcher and Action Launcher 3, I decided to stay with the stock TouchWiz Launcher. Doesn't bother me, i've used Samsung devices such as the GS2 (AT&ampT Varient) and the GS4. Have used TouchWiz on both and its not that bad as most say, but thats me personally. 
I don't understand. If the Note 5 was even the slightest bit better than the Note 4 and had a microSD card slot/removable battery, it'd sell like hotcakes. My hopes and dreams &lt/3
I use s note synced to evernote.  Action memo has an option to convert it straight into a phone call, contact, or email.  The email function is great if you meet someone, you can jot down their email address with the screen off, then send them an email so they have your address, them convert the action memo into a new contact.  A note will convert your scribbles into typed letters.Evernote syncs it all up and has more robust organizational tools
Well I have a One M8 and the screen is cracked on it. So i'm really looking forward to this phone.
If it's not an icon, just remove it. If you're not sure, just remove it. )
Weirdly, I had the Note 3 previously and never used the micro SD nor changed batteries but now I wished it had it lol. Still loving it though 
Funny, because I used an S6 and compared the new 5.1 firmware on the Note 4 and that huge speed difference everyone seems to claim is nearly no existent when opening and closing normal apps and opening the recents panel. I'd love to see a video comparison. 
as said by theDEVIN8310, it's done via screenwrite.I'm just writing to complain that I went to go watch some YouTube video explaining how to do it and the bastard skipped right over the part where he said to use screenwrite. I had to watch it twice to see what he did. It's not the most intuitive, I spent a good amount of time looking for a way to add the option to the action menu.
That's what I'm trying to do. It's just annoying to see these AT&ampT customers having already received their phones because AT&ampT can't read a street date. The last pre-order I participated in with T-Mobile was for the Nexus 6, which didn't go very smoothly. I just hope the stores have plenty of stock on Friday.
I've called Verizon support to ask them and got two different answers. Same with Verizon stores. Nobody knows wtf they are talking about apparently. 
My wifes iphone 6 battery lasts much longer than my Note 5 so far.  It is what it is.  I still prefer Android to OS. 
For me, most places have me swipe my own card, so I'm very excitedI think for my average use, the only place it won't work is the ATM, so I plan to try a few cases for the phone that will let me tuck a couple cards into it along with some cash (license, $20, debit card should be all I need)
have you tried adjusting nova's animations speeds? You may have set them faster on your old device and not on your Note 5.Also, remember if you are using the homekey to open app drawer that the Samsung home button has a tiny bit of lag due to waiting for the second press for the camera shortcut. Which I'm cool with now because using it as a camera shortcut is actually pretty handy.
Prepare to be disappointed. It follows the same design language as the S6, with an added curve at the back. 
50$ for a risk of breaking the glass and Warranty killed for only 50$ lol I get my note 4 batteries for 10. 
I used it at Petco today, it was hassle-free.I did encounter something kind of annoying - if you're going to try out Samsung Pay and think you might want to change your password to your Samsung account, do so before registering a card on your phone. I changed my password, then verified it on my phone and it wiped out the card I had verified for Pay. I then had to go through the whole process of calling the bank to verify it again. Not a huge deal, but inconvenient nonetheless.
It almost failed for me at Target because the cashier saw me waving my phone and tried to click some mobile payment key he has. Once he clicked back it went through fine, to his surprise.
Yeah they recommend enabling everything before taking an update. Luckily it's easy to back up your list, enable all, and restore the list after updating! 
The note 2, 3 and 4 have nfc payments.  How is Samsung pay better? Serious question.  Is it a security concern? 
What are your settings looking like?  My battery is crap so far. 
Haven't gotten it yet so I don't want to tell you the wrong thing but looking online at previous devices, it does look like it stops a little before the edge, which is nice to me because it won't catch on anything and you can potentially fit a case on it 
I wouldn't get too excited, most of the heavily affecting bloatware is the hardest to remove usually. But I suppose for now just disable all non useful apps from your app list. I'd definitely flash a custom rom if you want true debloating. I'm running a KitKat rom on my Note 4 that gives me about 50% more battery life that my old lollipop stock rom did, as well as responding almost twice as fast to everything. 
Ok, this is making sense. Does the pen also double as a stylus, for fine touch control? 
The camera lense is covered with sapphire crystal, so you really don't have to worry about scratching it unless your using a diamond. Though, the crystal is very brittle, so you don't want to put a lot of pressure on it or it will shatter.
Mine works perfectly, can't even tell it apart from the normal screen. I'll edit with the brand.E: Can't find the box but i remember it was  $34.99 and mostly green. It had an applying mechanism too.
thanks Snave. To be honest it is  lot harder to pick up Note 5 than that. Even online retailers only, are not able to stock it. No chance of Carphone Warehouse.They have a pre reg for S6 Edge+ but its like the note 5 doesn't exist in UK!
One of the scratches you could feel, perhaps with the other ones but I'm still mindblown by the one scratch.
So, I've tried some things.  I cleared the cache/data and rebooted.  Still no 60fps on several tested videos.  I uninstalled the updates and rebooted.  Tested and still no 60fps.  Re-installed updates and rebooted. Again no 60fps.  Very strange. 
I suppose gorilla glass is not all it's cracked up to be
The heart rate sensor, if it's anything like the galaxy s6 it doesn't have a glass covering. They used plastic and it scratches VERY quickly
Worrying is what I do best. How's your battery life so far?
Go to phone&gtthen click on more on the top right corner&gtsettings&gtthen turn off Voice over LTE settings also disable wifi calling. Afterwards just charge it to full then see if it still drains your battery. 
I still have the first Note. On my 3rd battery, rooted. Still works without problems, but gets a bit slow with current software..Now seeing if China has some other stylus phones..
I think Chromecast would suit your needs.
Would you agree that this S-Pen design is the worst of the last 4 designs?
Yep, I've been played with it today... but note that I *think* you'll need to re-enable everything (that you disabled with PD) before you'll be able to take an OTA... I'm not certain until one comes along but I suspect that's the case. 
I use google now launcher, disabled touchwiz launcher. I leave wifi off because unlimited data, and bluetooth / location I leave on 24/7.Everything else is normal. I only use phone for chrome / Hearthstone / Google Now / Google Music / Facebewks / IT Apps though. Don't have a bajillion messaging apps or spotify , etc.I did disable as many preloaded apps as possible, including s-voice though. Generally helps battery life.
Nova also let's you have control over your wallpaper scrolling too. 
5.0.x was a disaster, 5.1.1 fixed all the issues. Ods are you probably haven't even used a Note 4 on the 5.1.1 firmware. I've used an S6 several times now for comparison and running the Note 5 firmware, it's clearly a step below stock android (which I used for 6 months on a Moto X 2), and the Note 4 clearly matches it. Only lacking areas are the samsung optimized apps such as the camera, but opening normal apps like youtube and facebook provide an almost non existent speed bonus on the new Touchwiz firmware. Sorry, but you are overblowing this speed difference, it's minor at best.
This is probably the more disappointing thing for me. It's just for a couple of cards it feels like ISIS/SoftCard all over again. I expected the LoopPay tech to be leveraged for non-participating cards so one can use stuff like a HSA card or a gift card.I got an invite, but no point if it wont take anything I have.
That would be sweet! I'm kinda hoping that their cooking up a 64gb for the price of 32gb promo like they did in the past for the S6. That would rock!!
It's out for very few TMobile Note 4 N910T3 models, the newer versions, it seems  they were special cases where people returned their Note 4's for repairs and got a device running the 5.1.1 update. The OTA should be out in a matter of weeks at most, but in the meantime T-Mobile devices are extremely easy to root and flash, so downloading the 5.1.1 update and flashing it is a 3 click process at most.
Did not think to check. Seeing as how the s6 shares the same design and retains its IR blaster, I would find it surprising if it was omitted on the Note 5. 
Geeze, that's a serious upgrade.
Don't worry about how much memory in use at any given time, Linux based systems are designed to work like this. The RAM will be made available for whatever apps need it. 
When comparing it to the Note 5's screen, I don't think powerhouse is a fair word to use unless you are saying they both have great screens. The Nexus 6's screen is just slightly larger, same resolution, probably a bit less bright but I haven't researched that.
yes they do. well, not if you define burn in as the old-school burn in, where screensavers helped, but the end result is the same, you can see outlines of static images on white backgrounds
Did you ever wipe the screen with your shirt or any cloth because of fingerprints? If so, micro dust must be the culprit of that. 
Uhh I believe you should be able to just hit the home button and it should take you out of the dialer app... Might have to be on speaker phone though :P
No fucking around. They've stacked other components on top of the processor to free battery space. 
I just picked up a 64gb in store. They had them in both colors. South Florida is a pretty big market for t-mo/metro so maybe that's why.
There are going to be a lot of credit card readers (any where you have to insert the whole card) that won't work with Samsung Pay, or situations where you won't want to use it (you don't want to give your unlocked phone to your waiter to take to the back).SP will be nice, but you'll find it won't let you leave your card at home.
My local Costco sold the last T-Mobile version they had at around noon. Rep said he had sold all 8 they had. I got there straight away so I got my Sapphire Black pretty quickly! Fuck the haters. 
Source?  I have unlimited data also, and would love to believe that Verizon isn't getting rid of subsidies and contract, but I can't find anything to prove otherwise. 
I do not recommend Spigen. They do make good quality cases, but I've found their materials are slippery. If you drop your phone like me, the Spigen cases will only increase the occasions it happens. I previously had the Slim Armor on a different phone and didn't learn my lesson and got the Ultra Hybrid for the Note5 both slip more than I'd like.The LK Drop Protection Case line looks like it can take a beating and not slip at least on a table. I can't speak to their quality, but they're low risk at &lt$1so pretty cheap.You can always go with the tried and true Otterbox. Always highly rated for being able to take a beating and they'll send you a replacement for free if it gets worn out. Personally, I don't like them purely for how bulky they are and how their materials stretch over time with heavy use.If the company that made the bumper I got for my Note 3 did the same thing for the Note 5, I would have gotten that in a heartbeat. They don't and none of their cases fit what I'm looking for.
I like the note 5Its cheaper and has more functionality with the S pen. Yes, you lose out on the edges, but I hated that way it felt in the hand. The edges felt sharp, whereas the note is much smoother
Kinda sucks I had a nokia lumia 925 that falls into that category but I threw it away a few days ago before the promotion xD.But I guess I'll just give them my Nokia Lumia 1520. The Note 5 will be the phone I'll be using from now on anyway so no real use to keep the 1520.EDIT: Actually, good news for me just found my Nokia Lumia 925 and a Nokia Lumia 52xD. They were in a balled up in a plastic bag. So I'll see how this goes on Friday.
Or you can vote with your money, buy one of the cheaper alternatives and see if they get the message when the note 6 is released. I don't like not having an sd, but there's no reason to make the battery permanent and that's no longer a rumor.  
How much space does the OS take.Thanks
In my experience this has always been the way, no 3g/4g whilst talking on the phone. Wifi works like you say.
Is it not under display?
I got the JETech (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0132XCT0U) and I don't think I like it - I'll keep it on for a day or two and give it a proper trial, but it really looks like crap. It's significantly smaller than the front face of the phone so it has a border all around it. More importantly, I think it's deliberately smaller because the phone itself has a slight curvature that creates a gap between the phone and the screen protector ... and that brings me to the absolute worst thing about this screen protector - the halo they call it, all around the edges of the screen protector there is a bit of separation from the device. The screen protector is flat while the phone below it curves down slightly. You get a gap all around the edge. I'm sure this gap will fill up with dust and dirt, but even if it doesn't, it looks like crap.
Not slow, but mine was cutting out a lot during large transfers until I switched to my 5Ghz spectrum AP. I read something about an issue between Android and Samsung (seems like finger-pointing) and it's causing problems with certain WiFi setups.I didn't register this as slowness, though, I would just start getting warnings that there was no network connectivity (in any app).
&gt 3GB of ram is fine on my Note 3Think about that though - the same amount of ram as many phones released in 2013?  When the industry consensus for flagships is to move to 4GB of ram?  If 3GB is the actual spec, then this release is a step back for Samsung on the Note line, and signals a different direction.  This was always the power user's android phone, and the changes that are rumored indicate that instead of being the power user's device, that Samsung is tweaking this to compete with your grandmother's Iphone 6 plus, by powering down specs and features for looks....
Really hoping it's just incorporated into the rear camera. I have always felt that the placement on the top didn't make sense for a phone (i.e. I'm looking at the screen, but I have to hold it parallel to the ground, which is not ideal for looking at the screen).If it's in the camera assembly, I will be ecstatic.
That's a long cover on the Sim card slot. It's possible that could house a microSD slot, as well.
The note 5 is going to have wireless charging though, and with qi's announcement of the 2.firmware which will bring the wireless charging speeds close to the quick charge range means there isn't much of a reason not to use wireless charging.Thats personally why i don't see any advantage to USB type C at this point....  you would get faster data transfer and I suppose be more future proofed...  but if not having to flip the USB connector is your reasoning, that doesn't seem like a big issue due to wireless charging.
Are you sure the wired one works with the Note 5? I don't want to buy a cable and have it not work (happened with my friend)And is there a lot of latency in the wireless one?
Samsung bought Looppay and use their technology.  I heard good things about loop before Samsung bought it, so I'm cautiiously optimistic.  The issue for me is, I still shop a lot of places where either the cashier takes your card behind the counter, or to a kiosk in the other end of the restaurant to swipe it, or you put your card inside the machine instead of swiping, and loop / samsung pay won't work anywhere like that.BUT it will work about 10X as many places as NFC which is huge, and once the chip and pin cards hit and NFC is accepted everywhere, you'll already have all your info in place on samsung pay.
I don't. I just use chrome. My phone's screen is big enough to make it work nicely.
Did this... no luck. The spen actually chipped a bit at the tip and the nub I had on bent... I'm just going to give up and go to tmobile tomorrow...
I was playing these games no problem on my note 3 though.
BAHHHHH TOP1COMPLETE FAIL!1A- No removable battery1B-  Smaller battery... don't need that Samsung. Asians/Koreans already have smaller... you know XD2- FAST Wireless Charging -&gt 2hrs are fast?! &gt.&lt My grandma can charge it faster...3A- only 5M front facing camera...cmon the older G4 has 8... my selfie stick will hit me in my face :(3B- Wuttt? %(??$/%-brand new hybrid autofocus system? Which one of the two videos was using it? I thought they both looked the same... Next time, for the presentation they should record the videos with a dSLR, like Nokia did with the Lumias HAHA4A- No Microsd Card Slot... data plans in Germany are still too expensive to stream my p0*n collection to my ... how did the lady in blue describe it?

Why no reversible USB3/USB-C port then?!6- No IR-blaster. WDF?! Do they include an additional remote control for my dslr in the box?7- Who needs a Galaxy Edge Plus? I don't need an edgeless Galaxy S6 plus! Wait? Was it Galaxy Note Edge Plus? Or Galaxy Alpha Edge Plus A8... F**k this. Give us faster Android upgrades and longer support! People actually need only 1 or 2 models to choose from. You can copy that from Apple as well! Btw... don't do the 1variations of the Galaxy phone... the Chinese people will have a hard time copying it... or not, since they all look the same... and the Chinese already figured out to build in bigger batteries. Actually the entire Chinese phone will probably as much as the additional Samsung keyboard cover and will also be exclusively sold in Asia and maybe the US =)8- The keyboard cover is ridiculous! It's uglier than my original Gameboy! ... (no not the Gameboy pocket!) 9- No release in Europe...because they figured out we cannot afford to buy a Note5 after donating all our fortune to Greece. Maybe Samsung will export it to Greece only...10- Poor presentation. A presenter who joins the applause of the audience?! It felt weird to watch. Actually, they should copy the keynotes from Apple, not the non-removable battery. Even the Galaxy orchestra from last year was better...Ohh btw. I am not a Samsung/Android hater =) I'm using a Note3 and have been modding, rooting and flashing it hard so I could get rid of hmm... Samsung Knox, Samsung Apps, Samsung Buy Pizza, Samsung Hub, Samsung Buy Spam, Samsung Region Lock and upgrade to Android 5.1.1 (Samsung only offers 5.on my Galaxy Note 3, but unfairly they already offer Android 5.0.0.1.5 on the Galaxy Note 3 Plus Nonedge Neo).So my wishlist for the Galaxy Note 6:Come back to the original motto: PRODUCTIVITY. If I want to have a nice looking phone, I could go to the Galaxy S line or Apple.-&gt You actually forgot your know-hows... The Omnia Phones had removable batteries and aluminium back covers that felt awesome.-&gt Better front facing camera. I like taking pictures of beautiful me.-&gt Windows phone 10. No need to put hard work in updates no more NEVER EVER... Microsoft will do it for you... How does it sound?! (assumed Samsung won't release Windows phone 1Touchwiz OMG)
*Should* come down.  However, I wouldn't be surprised if it holds its price because the demand for the Note 4 will probably go up now being that the Note 5 has done away with some of the favorite features of Note users, and the Note 4 will be the best phone for all of the people who want a stylus and productivity but don't want the crippled Note 5.
Yeah I wouldn't mind it. I wonder why it wouldn't have the Galaxy Note5 on the back though? Maybe Sprint really wants us to know what phone we own without a spec of doubt haha
Poor call reception can have a big impact on battery life
Verizon can't afford to give you earbuds with your $80phone because they spent too much money on paint for their enormous tramp stamp on the back of the device.
It is almost certain that the Note 5's battery is 4100mAh, which is simply ludicrous. 
That's OK, you can just throw a SD card in it........ :-(
Turn on power saving mode. It's save to leave it on all the time
I have several mobile chargers, but they are always aggravating because they are so slow. Been looking at this and now is the time to get it. Thanks for the discount code!...just wish it had a built-in cable that stored inside it, but can't have it all I guess.
getrid of the built in effects and use the Equalizer app
You can also buy a quick car charger from them for $9.49 after using code ZSBP8QMP for $7.5off.http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00LJT2EPK/ref=pd_aw_fbt_107_img_2?ie=UTF8&amprefRID=0XR89ZS9QHE6V401EXWT
Oh man - I have been trying to peel it off the lense too
Just talked to a very helpful sprint rep. they suggested I drop into the store and swap it with another one since it's brand new and it seems to be hardware related.
It really depends. As someone who is far from a power user, the Note 5 packs more than enough battery to get me through my day. I think a lot of people on /r/android are power users...whatever it is that that actually means.  Personally, I just really need a great camera and display, and while I'm sure the new iPhone will have an industry leading camera like usual, you really can't beat Samsung's AMOLED panel. 
My AT&ampT has the globe, and down below it, says Galaxy Note5 It looks good on the black I think.  
You need a quickcharge 2.compatible charger for the car.
Tough call as to whether that will happen. They obviously wanted to do better than the Note 4. Giving us an upgraded one of those wasn't going to work for their sales goals. If it would have, we would have seen one. It comes down to whether the 5 sells, and how they react if it doesn't. I'm tempted to think they'll just have the stylus on the S7 or S7+, and that'll be the end of the Note series. But, I don't want that to happen. 
I know you said you didn't have much access to data and WiFi but I use Dropbox and Google apps (Photos and Drive) to back up most things on my phone. Just backing up and deleting photos and videos alone is a great storage saver on my S5, and since I already use Dropbox for my job, i have the 1TB plan which is more than enough space for me. All my other files, like documents and such, go onto Google drive and Dropbox (I'm super paranoid about losing things so I double back up most things). I also think there are a few apps and things that you can use to back up your texts if that's necessary for you. As for power options, my advice would be to look on Samsung's website (I don't know if they have e anything now or if they will in the future) and check amazon for the best options. I hope I helped at least a little! 
Are we talking about the headphones in the box? Those should have been free. 
Yup that's why I switched.  unlimited data isn't so cool when it fucking sucks
I'd say a child can break most phones in a matter of seconds, actually. Not just a pen hole.
[Here picture for the bottom and top](http://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/galaxy-note-5-2.jpg). So basically, those renders of SimCard slot is fake, since it was at top before. Also anyone notice the two hole on top? They don't seemed to be align with each-other, which is kind of bother me (Maybe its just the picture?).
&gt Samsung is definitely big enough to set up a clear and easy path for this, for people that have concerns.They have done that, since the S6.  Free if it's under warranty, $45 if it's not. Samsung says they guarantee a 1 day turnaround.
Seriously, why is everyone getting so upset over it? If you think the Note 4 is better, *buy the Note 4!* No one needs the newest phone every year. Yeah, it's nice, but if you'd be more content with the year-old model, buy it. You can't expect phone companies to cater towards you if they can still get your money from the previous version. I hope that makes sense. 
Stock messaging app and keyboard.
&gt plenty of research on other phones that do have IR/MicroSD/Removable BatteriesWhich phones are those?
Is there a chance they will offer a note 5 edge at a later date? Debating on whether to buy a new phone this weekend or hold out.
I have a 32GB phone with a 64GB sd card. I was thinking of getting a 128GB card since they are under $5nowadays. Music wise, there is never enough space by putting in discographies.I also have streaming of music from my NAS, but it is not as snappy as playing from a local storage, specifically when some files are pretty high bitrate. In 3G areas using cell service can be slow to download from my NAS (like traveling between cities). Specifically when I want to skip a song but the next one has not buffered in yet.
With Quick Charging disabled, 9 months. 6 Months with it enabled. Lots of note 4 complains about quick charging started to appear after the 6mo mark. The tech hasn't changed, just the ability to replace it. Quick Charging hurts battery life over time faster than normal charging. 
Just wanted to point out that the new camera software allows slow motion videos with sound. Quality is about the same as before (not great I'd advise shooting 60fps and slowing down in post ... ideally with decent interpolation)
This is no surprise. This is, afterall, the carrier that's also intent on blocking one of Samsung's biggest, most exciting new features, Samsung Pay.
I don't know why Samsung didn't announce it, but on their official website they do offer a 128GB model... Not that this will make much of a difference compared to removable battery &amp microSD. http://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/cell-phones/all-products
I disagree. Giving us an updated Note 4 would have led to a lot of current Note users upgrading to the 5. I've a haunting suspicion those buying Note 5s will be either new Samsung customers or those that have never previously owned a Note. They're taking a risk by alienating loyal customers in hopes they are replaced by new ones. I agree. I strongly doubt there will be a Note 6. 
But it looks like that accounted for less than a percent of overall draining. My phone radio is one of the main things draining my battery.
Probably have to get the T-Mobile's Note 5 unlocked first before being able to use an ATT sim with it.
My Battery is fine. If the idea of a non-removable and battery and no SD was a bad practice, the iPhone would have died out many years ago. I am not worried about the battery taking a dump. If it does, that's what the replacement plan is for.
They must be US Bank or Bank of America cards. If you live near a US bank branch you can go in an get a prepaid debt card and see if it works for the beta.
Ehh I like the curved edge on my note 4 because you can feel when you're getting near the edge without looking down :P
I had the 3 and went with the 64gb 5. It's a great upgrade for me. Smoother os. Sleeker design. Rapid charging. It suits all my needs 
If an SD card or removable battery are important to you, go with the Note 4. If not, definitely the Note 5. I was very happy with my Note 4, but the 5 slays it in every way. I flashed numerous roms on the Note 4 (with TEKHD's being the best for me), and the Note 5 performs better than all of them. This is the first phone I've had that I didn't feel the need to root immediately. Even with root being achieved, I'm still happy waiting until they figure out how to do it without tripping Knox. The phone battery also lasts longer than it did on the Note 4. I consistently get 16+ hours with maybe 4-5 hours SOT before I throw it on the charger at 30-40%. 
I've never used much of the voice control when I had my Moto X (2013). So S Voice being worse than google voice commands wasn't an issue for me.  The new Moto phone looks really solid for the price. If the s pen isn't something you use often and saving money is a concern the new Moto looks like it would be a great phone if you like the size of these screens.The new Nexus is surrounded by with too many rumors for me to really say one thing or another. But I feel the Nexus and Moto X will be very similar save for a few specs here and there. If you're happy with your Note 5 and what it can do, I doubt you'll be happier with the other two phones. I changed back to Google Now launcher on my Note 5 and it feels enough like my Moto X with some cool updates that I don't feel like I'm going to miss what Moto did well with my old phone.
http://imgur.com/KLRRTd0I don't know why, but I just don't like icons and widgets all over my home screen. I just like to be able to look at my wallpapers.
In settings, Under display,  set touch key light duration to always off. 
I just put on my ExtremeGuard glass screen protector earlier this morning. I got it for less than $6 on sale, so i was kinda skeptical, but it seems fine so far.
If I kept my brightness that high at all I'd have a depleted battery in a few hours I think.  Sigh. 
Nope, just on the flash
&gtI will always favor a device that runs stock android to a device that uses Samsung's Touchwiz. That's all I needed to read. Glad to know you aren't the majority of users
Honestly only reason (other then my note 4 broke) is samsung pay, and the updated finger print scanner 
I have a regular S6 edge and the Note 5 - I always thought that the edge screen looks cool and it does, but the thinner aluminum frame is uncomfortable. Not much if a problem with my Note 5 at all. I'd say Note 5 based in my own preference. 
Standard layout on any phone I have. I don't like clutter. Double-tap on the screen for Google Now, swipe up for Google Voice Commands. Works for me.http://i.imgur.com/iBoFkpV.jpg
Thanks, that's good to know. We need to make sure the cashiers know that if we are putting our phones over the card reader, it's just like swiping a regular card as far as their terminals are concerned.
I had Roughly 23. 5 gigabytes of Space free on the Verizon model. 
Battery size?
I'm definitely not getting the Note 5. The glass back, the abysmal battery size (3,00mAh), lack of microSD support, and abysmal internal storage (the lowest at 32 GB and the highest at 64 GB) really makes me cringe.The Note 4 is probably the last Samsung phone I'll buy, unless Samsung actually listens to all of its consumers (power users included), instead of claiming that Samsung is listening to its consumers, but is only listening to its mainstream consumers.
There are people that use the phone more than you, and of course they are going to need a way to get full charge back in the lowest amount to of time possible. Also, you just can't beat third party 6400mah and 10000mah third party batteries. 
&gt Samsung will deny the warranty as its not a defect.No they won't.  The warranty specifically covers the battery if it falls below 80% capacity.  And if it's longer than a year so it's out of warranty, they only charge you $45.
The Note 5 seems to be just a bigger version of the S6 with an extra 1GB of RAM. Depending on pricing and your screen size preference, take your pick.
Try to use Package Disabler to disable it. It's in the Play Store.
I currently have one, yes it does have a halo around it but one I have a case on it its not noticeable, it stays on well and covers the screen well though
http://mimeusa.com Just ordered mine here. Tempered glass than a screen protector. A little pricey but this is an expensive device. 
No no I am praising the Note 4. I can just replace the battery.I am saying you are likely stuck with the Note 5 if the battery goes bad.Or are you saying you could replace the Note 5's battery for 5dollars?
Personally I carry about a lot of audio books in my phone, which are several hundred megabytes each. I have about 2books, several gigabytes of videos and pictures. Just checked and I'm using roughly 60GB, I was a bit annoyed about the lack of micro SD card but considering I could easily drop my usage by removing 15 of the books I've finished, I might be fine with the 64GB. Assuming the 64GB price isn't too insane. I've seen the 32GB for $130nzd (855 USD)
LG g4 (maybe the flex too) has all of the above.Nexus devices have removable batteries and SD slots.HTC one has an IR blaster (SD slot maybe?)
I wonder if Samsung will look at this issue in future software updates and try to fix it, or if they will just not give a f*** and move on to working on the S7 release...
I can't find any specifications on this anywhere..
Must be a software glitch or something. I just wanted to make sure I wasn't the only one who noticed this.
*that's before the 5.1 update that just arrived for various carriers BTW, so that slays it is extremely overblown. 
I normally use Nova, but I was playing around on my wife's S6 edge plus, and they added some nice changes to the TouchWiz launcher. I should be getting my Note 5 in a couple of days, so I'm going to try the stock launcher to see if I can handle it. I'm guessing I'll end up downloading Nova Prime eventually like I always do because of the simple and plentiful customization options.
I was having issues with the two I tried out this weekend. I snagged the Skinomi one and it didn't adhere to the glass at all, so it looked like shit. It was also far too small and didn't cover the screen in the right places. Right now I have a IQ Shield on it, it feels quite nice but the right side of the screen has that halo effect and also isn't quite adhering 100% So I ultimately wouldn't recommend either one of these, I feel like I wasted $2but some protection is better than none for now. 
Yeah they have a lot of similarities, the Note 5 is just a little more refined, has the S-pen and is cheaper so that's why I chose it! 
TouchWiz is much smoother on the Note 5 btw.
I called almost 2stores over the weekend and I got a pretty clear picture of the situation from talking to a number of reps: the 64Gb, for some unbelievable reason, is a rare beast, color be damned.  In fact, I found only ONE store than got ANY in stock: just two... and that was almost a three-hour drive to a neighboring state, so I wound up with a 32Gb that I'll use JoD to upgrade to a 64Gb when I find one.For whatever reason, few stores got any 64Gb, even though EVERY SINGLE REP told me that people asked for it pretty much every single time.  I just don't get it, someone seriously miscalculated it seems like (or Samsung didn't supply enough, not sure which it is).Also, a number of reps told me something even more amazing: you know how you can normally ship a phone to a store?  Well, not the 64Gb Note 5!  No one could tell me if that was a temporary restriction, but the T-Mobile main office made that inexplicable decision for now at least.  Translation: you really have only two choices right now: order online (which means if, like me, you were switching from Jump 2 to JoD you can't since that can only be done in store) or call around for the next week or two and hope you stumble on a store that has one.Me, I've got my 32Gb, which IS NOT enough space (I tried to make it work but there's too many compromises) and I've got my list of almost 2stores that I'm going to be bugging daily with phone calls (plus I left my name at the two stores I usually go to, and they SAID they'll call if one comes in, but I'm not really counting on that happening).Pretty frustrating if you want/need 64Gb, and really hard to understand why it is given the demand every single rep said they're seeing for them.  I kind of suspect supply issue, but that's just a gut feeling.
Are you noticing issues?  Why would you want the RAM used lower?  Seems like at 75% it's just doing its job and storing quick access info. 
Looks like plastic to me
I tried posting some info about the Samsung Pay Beta at /r/android yesterday in a self post and the mods deleted it twice because it wasn't related to Android
InfoSec guy here.  I'll go against everyone else here and say yes, I recommend you run some sort of anti malware software.  I use Lookout personally.  Malware on Android is a rapidly growing threat, and no, the Play store won't save you.Source:  (There are many other reports all finding huge increases in Android malware, not just the one mentioned by Symantec, BTW)https://www.yahoo.com/tech/report-one-in-five-android-apps-is-malware-117202610899.html
what apps do you find using the most? i've used the app cpuspy to analyze any battery drainage 
I get pops and low frequency rumblings when I stream music in the car with a cassette adapter. The Note5 puts out a bunch of interference requiring me to move the cord around just right to get it to stop. If I unplug it and move the cord on top of the Note5 it gets worse and move it away it stops. It's not that GSM sound either. Doesn't matter if it's a streaming app or local MP3. I really need to get off my butt and install that bluetooth adapter for my headunit that's collecting dust on my desk.
BTW I fixed it flashing the stock rom
AT&ampT here. This is what I have under Lockscreen and Security:http://imgur.com/a623Mtr
Good to know. I love their customer service. 
My spigen exact fit will be here tomorrow. From the pics it looked like a very slim hardshell case with a very minimal lip. I like the Samsung cases as well, had one for my S6, but I'm not paying $35 for one, I'll wait until they go on sale. 
I don't have a screen guard and haven't had any problems so far.  How did the scratch happen?
I was experiencing the same issue. Tried it with and without the case on my phone, tried different cables and outlets with no luck. I exchanged it for a different one at best buy and still didn't work. Bought a Tylt Vu wireless charger and it has worked flawlessly. 
Does anybody use Flipboard? I disable the briefing (actually, I use the Google launcher so it's replaced with Now), but I do like to use the Flipboard app every now and then.Am I missing out on something better?[Edit: sorry wasn't meant for this to be a direct reply to Tonkatitties, but it can stay now]
The glass screen protector I am using now (with crappy halo issue) doesn't impact the s-pen in any real negative way. However you will have slightly more distance between the screen and the pen tip
There is no way in the world I would use this thing naked. In a slim TPU case and glass screen protector it went 3seconds after taking it out of the box. Samsung's design is curiously fragile, but we know their angle (iObviously).Give us a ballistic design with a sapphire screen on the Note 6. And the other stuff the internet is still crying about while you are at it Sammy. This is a tool, not a museum piece.
The app just updated and now it's playing 60fps as it should.  I emailed the developers a few days ago.  Maybe they listened! Prob just coincidence.  :)
I plugged it into the adaptive fast charger and left the room.  When I came back, it was sparking and smoking.  Dead Note 4...Looks like the phone is getting a warranty repair, but thanks to a screw up in my carrier's billing (they still list my old Note 2 as my phone) I may be able to upgrade without penalty when Note 4 comes back from repair.  Wondering if it is worth the jump to the 5 right now, or wait for the 6.
I have a Verizon note 5 and cell standby is draining 30% of my battery. Anyone have a fix for this? I guess it's related to WiFi.
Cloud storage is always an option. And there's a one year warranty on the battery from Samsung, as well as the option for an external battery. If this stuff is that important to you, get the Note 4 or look at other options (LG G4 is one that is thrown around quite a bit these days). Sorry you're disappointed but there are always other options so don't get too upset about a phone. 
It is impossible that the Note 5 could be superior in any way to the Note 4, I talked to a reddit power user who told me that the device was a downgrade from the Note 4 and the screen was the same as the Note 4.  Its impossible that this power user could have missed software and processor improvements to the display.   I had him show me his removable battery and huge SD card to demonstrate that he was in fact a real power user and not some fraud.  
WTF Samsung. Smaller battery AND no micro SD support? Are you out of your fucking minds? That seals the deal. There is no more deal. You really screwed the pooch. You took away where you shouldn't have and added no extra value. 
Do the edges of the JETech adhere to the screen, or are they slightly lifted?
I got told I could use the card towards the purchase of the phone but I could only buy the phone on contract to get the deal. Sounds like every store is different
There is no SD card slot. 
A couple of months? Where do you get your info from sir? If your battery starts to degrade that quick your living in 2001 or you have something wrong with your phone
Same CPU, 33% more RAM than the s6.
Supposedly it's Gorilla Glass 4, which Corning claims is the best they've done. I was hoping by now we wouldn't need to put on a screen protector of any sort. 
Don't do it. I got curious myself. Cliff notes: the wrong end fits ~perfectly~ in the silo. 1mm in was all I needed to nope the fuck outta there. Curiosity fulfilled. Never again...thank god it didn't get stuck.Liken it to turning your car off using the key or start/stop button while going 80mph. It may or may not do anything. Don't find out, just block the idea from your mind.
Fingers crossed, tracking says it's on truck for delivery, hope it's there when I get home from work
actually the yellow i see is  Haidinger's Brush. i see it on this display better than any other that i can recall. some monitors have more splotchy yellow stuff on them than most.
Can u talk a little bit  of the camera  in manual mode specially the low sutter speed and slow motion  quality 
It's not a bug. It's supposed to let you know that you can write on the screen even when the screen is off. That's why also the phone vibrates at the same time. 
Nice to see you fixed it. On my note 4 the stock app got laggy where as Textra never lagged once even with a year of texts. Also using swift key
All I did was pinch to zoom on home screen and went to wallpaper....just in case this annoys anyone else too
Switch it to LTE/CDMA and see if that helps. I don't have many issues with Sprint where I am located. 
One of my cats got ahold of my s-pen, chewed about 1/4-1/2 off the writing end.  T-mobile doesn't have s-pens in stock, neither does best buy, and samsung doesn't have them listed on their site yet.
&gt Samsung told thousands of loyal Note users to go eff themselves in the butt.If this is the tone of the response from the loyal Note users, I can't believe Samsung did not respond to their mature, well thought out suggestions.  You probably have some good points about the Note 5 being an overgrown S6 but no one is going to listen to you if you continue to express yourself like a raging middle schooler.  UNLESS you were being literal and someone from Samsung actually called you up and told you to go eff yourself in the butt.  In which case you need to do an AMA!
People need to backoff the judgements based on rumors in general. Until the official announcement everything you said is basically up in the air. Why are people getting so excited? Jesus fuck. If you don't like the Note 5. Choose another device or keep the one you have. You have that choice. HTC and Sony are barely holding their heads above water, they could use the business. But oops, they've got unique quirks of their own. So you're basically left with Samsung and LG after that. Maybe OnePlus? Motorola? Whatever the Nexus ends up being (but the way things are going it won't have IR, SD or removable battery either). What % of people if people saying they'll boycott Samsung or the Note 5 today will eventually end up buying one? So much emotion. They're devices. Not family members. Make your choice. Compromise if you must and move on. 
I was with Sprint for over 1years. I finally dumped them a year ago for T-Mobile. I get speeds of 40-85 down and 10-3up. To much better. 
I plan on getting a slim case and glass screen protector. 
I have never heard of this before but it does peak my interest. $129 upfront for 2 years of coverage and $95 to replace a Galaxy Note device up to 3 times is MUCH better than what you'd get from a carrier. I might have to take them up on this once the Note 5 is listed under the plans.ATT for example is $1a month. That's $24over 2 years, not to mention the $20deductible. 
Try different USB cables.
I see, my headphones are already tuned to be neutral so I guess that's why they sounded the same. 
S pen is Note only.
People shouldn't roll their brand new phones down a flight of stairs.  That is something very foolish that someone could do.  That being said, both Apple and Samsung test their phones being rolled down flights of stairs.  When testing a product, you need to consider all the possibilities.  This one should have and probably did come up and they dropped the ball on 'idiot-proofing' something that would have been very easy to prevent.
No removable battery makes me want to purchase a Note 4 instead.
are you shitting me?now what the fuck phone am I supposed to get?Or ... what is the solution here?? Is there an alternative? Can I strap a seven pound third party IR blaster to my 2005 USB port on my 2015 phone? I think they do make some hubs that work with bluetooth or something. but fuck. fuck you samsung. I should buy something else out of spite. filthy little dicks.
Did the camera lense have plastic on it? I just picked up a note 5 and mine kinda looks like it does but I can't pick it off...
Not sure why you called a video that is literally titled First Look a video review...
While I can't say I'm thrilled with the battery life, it does seem to be able to provide a full day of moderate use on a single charge. My heaviest day included lots of time at max brightness, lots of camera/video use, some navigation/maps use, some gaming, etc. It made it through the day with 20% battery to spare - but that was only 3hrs SOT that I'm calling moderate to heavy use (max brightness most of the time).My lightest day the phone just sat in my pocket most of the time and I think the biggest drain on battery was signal hunting because I only had one bar most of the day.In conclusion, I find the battery to be satisfactory, not great.
You should probably update this thread to show the new rumored battery size, which is 4100mAh.
Yes, it behaves correctly. FYI - in case this is the issue: that sysdump will *always* say 560, even after you adjust the DPI. I set mine to 480, but it still shows 56in that sysdump.As for Wiz behaving, it's basically fine. The only thing that's a bit wonky is the camera, but it still works just fine like this: http://imgur.com/NaM9mfz. 
Chromecast is great for movies and there are a few games made for it. The only reason I did not mention it is that you said you wanted to play games on the TV. Most mobile games don't support Chromecast. 
Are there any correlations between battery life and display settings? 
Sounds like my fiasco after putting a nano-sim adapter tray in a phone without a nano-sim in it. It got stuck and was an absolute bitch to get out. The SIM pins compressed and sprung back into the void of the little adapter (as I inserted it) and I couldn't remove it. Had to find a thin piece of rigid plastic to fish down the side of the slot to raise the pins just enough to pull out the adapter tray. All in a hotel room away from home. Nightmare.Never again.
Why does air command have to look so terrible now??
Why the fuck do people care about the new design. It makes absolutely no sense. Part of the phone the majority people will cover with a case is now prettier and less functional. Fucking WOW. WOW I LOVE IT. 
Yeah, the S-pen is what pushes me to the Note 5. If the edge came with it, itd be a much tougher decision.
Nothing but the battery size even remotely annoys me, I got an external battery with my note 4,but even then it wasn't necessary. I look forward to buying my Note 5 next week.
If you're in the UK the carphone warehouse sells unlocked phones and they'll be stocking the note 5 I think. No idea about colours though sorry. 
Yeah maybe. The extended battery case for the s6 weighs 115g for an extra 70% instead of my 110g for an extra 200% current setup. At this point switching for the prospect of a thinner and lighter device that will only become thicker and heavier, makes no sense. But one day I probably will have to compromise or switch to the 6+I get why they sealed the battery. The mainstream user doesn't care, and why should they have to suffer a plastic back cover for my rigorous needs? But to say a groups needs are unjustified and belittle their claims because you don't share their use model? It's just bad faith. I could say people who want a glass back care more about holding their phone than actually using it or if you need a glass back so bad just get a glass case bruh For me my phone is a functional device I don't care if it's made of all plastic as long as it's light and durable, for others their phone needs to reflects their sense of fashion. but I know that people have legitimate claims even if they're outside my reality. 
I have AT&ampT and mine did come with headphones.
I currently have the note 3 waiting for the note 5 to come out. The note 4 wasn't much of an upgrade to waste my edge upgrade on. I'm hoping it's a lot better of an upgrade than the 4 was. 
Everything was super quick to launch. Camera was speedy as well. 
I went through and disabled all the at&ampt pre-installed garbage and saw this in there too. But I also wouldn't call it spyware. When you have a tech support issue, the at&ampt agents can actually remote into your phone to troubleshoot it. I'm assuming it's done using this app, along with a code they send you for confirmation.I'm definitely not rocking a tinfoil hat - I had a GS6, called them with an issue a couple months ago and this is exactly what they did. I'd love to get rid of it, but sadly Samsung won't sell us unlocked, unbranded phones just yet, so we're stuck with carrier-branded versions for the time being. 
Have you had any multitasking issues or other problems with RAM management? 
Wait, what? No! Are they doing CDMA only or something? Too much disappointment around devices in one week for me. 
dump touch wizard and pick up a third party luncher I personally use Nova, go into about build phone and tap on the build number 5 times  this will enable your developer options if not already, then turn the animations off. and turn off svoice, just use OK Google. and also I would recommend using Avast's smart cleaner to keep your phone clutter free and running new
If I had to guess as I don't have the phone yet, it's configuring based on your headphones more than your ears. Like if your headphones produce volume lower or higher on certain frequencies it can tune it to be closer to neutral. Or I guess also if you have trouble hearing certain frequencies. 
You can turn off VoLTE on t-mobile as well. Go to phone&gtMore&gtsettings and it should be there
I switched from Verizon 4 years ago.  For the price plus unlimited data I have no complaints. They have really been growing and strengthening their network,  at least here in Michigan.
Yeah so far today things are better. We'll see how it handles a session of Angry Birds 2!
I'm assuming i've been lucky. I've never bought anything for my Note 2 since it came out. Battery runs amazing and have a 64gb card. No complaints :)
My GPS worked pretty well on my 4, I've noticed it to be a bit faster on the 5 no problems so far but it could also be Google updating the maps. Not sure. 
I slapped a Skinomi protector on the phone after opening it on launch day, it wouldn't adhere to the glass properly at all. Contacted support and they sent me another one yesterday, but I have no idea when it's arriving. I ended up overnighting a IQ Shield from Amazon, the quality of this one seemed much higher but it's slightly off when lining it up. I have it perfectly aligned with the camera and sensor, yet a sliver of the screen is barely not covered by it and the glass is not centered around the button/fingerprint reader. This thing adhered pretty good up until I noticed the entire right side won't stick to the glass... So in short no, not a single decent recommendation yet. Skinomi said I must have gotten a first gen version of their protector, so when the new one gets here I'll try that out too. 
it's because the halo is a gap. if you have a gap, you leave space for foreign matter to make it's way into it and potentially increase the gap. worst case is that a piece of quartz or hard material slips into the gap and starts digging into your screen. it's not because it's ugly that i want a complete seal, but because i'm wanting to protect my screen.
In the Philippines, I preordered a few days ago from a Samsung store. They said it should arrive in store by September 5, however theres a chance it will arrive earlier and they'll notify me if so. No notification yet.
The problem is the ??O??in the AMOLED acronym, which stands for ??organic?? The organic compounds used in AMOLED displays are polymers or copolymers, such as polyfluorene (PFO) and polyphenylene vinylene (PPV), both of which degrade with use.This is partly due to the fact that the chemistry involved in creating the electroluminescence is irreversible, so the luminous pixels degrade as they??re used up, like a battery. These organic materials tend to crystallise, too ??an effect that is exacerbated at higher temperatures. That??s something to bear in mind the next time your phone becomes warm while you??re playing a game or watching a video.There are two main types of AMOLED display. Some have traditional RGB stripe layouts, such as those you??ll find on an LCD monitor, which use three subpixels per pixel. Others have a PenTile layout that employs a two-subpixel layout of red-green and blue-green pairs.As a result of this structure, PenTile screens contain twice as many green subpixels as reds and blues, and since it??s the blue subpixels that degrade most quickly, PenTile displays are less susceptible to screen burn than the RGB type of AMOLED screens.Incidentally, PenTile is a patented matrix layout owned by Samsung, although there are other manufacturers that have licensed it.edit: source: http://www.alphr.com/realworld/386635/are-amoled-displays-at-risk-of-burn-in
Turn off VoLTE in the phone settings. 
I'm hoping whatever battery improvements come with Android M that it turns this phone into a true all day battery...  And it would be nice if Samsung would look into their ram management, but thats a different issue
I think you will love Samsung screen. I don't know if you have owned S6 but Samsung likes colors. In terms of colors, i love S6 series, but in terms of screen looking sharp, i actually like LG G4 (Never used it but seen my cousin use it).
See the response from /u/I_AM_NOT_A_WOMBAT below. Also, I guess I had it in my head that my fingers were just as strong as tweezers. Maybe not - but I was using a lot of force trying to pull the pen out when I was in the store, and it didn't budge at all.
It's common enough in some circles. For me and many others who play ingress we have burn in even in our more modern Samsung's.  Warranty is only so long and it will still happen on newer panels, just after the warranty now.
I like the edge's screen and don't use the pen enough on my note 3 to rationalize it. The pen is good for somethings but I just don't use it enough. I think I'll get the edge plus. Also best buy is offering the wireless charging station free for people buying the note 5 or edge plus. That's where I'm going to go, just putting the word out!
Manually update?
I was considering importing also, I spoke to Clove the other day who said following their petition they hope that Samsung releases the Note 5 in Europe in some capacity this year / soon.This article has just popped up... so fingers crossed.http://www.phonesreview.co.uk/2015/08/24/galaxy-note-5-could-see-uk-europe-release-soon-after-all/I fancy a Titanium Silver.
Coming from a M7 myself, the Boomsound speakers are the only thing I've missed.    Well, I do have a minor issue with being unable to set a custom background for the settings menu... I hope to have a real solution eventually, instead of a workaround.    As for the audio goes with using headphones, I have a feeling you'll be pleasantly impressed with the audio settings like  Adapt Sound, UHQ Upscaler, SoundAlive+ (if you like stereo widening) and Tube Amp Pro.    The Note 5 is a solid upgrade over the M7.    Better in every way with the exceptions being lack of stereo speakers and the screen being ever so *slightly* too large, for consistent one hand use.
Verizon here no headphones 
You couldn't be more wrong. Example I open Fallout Shelter, play it a bit. Hit home, open Reddit Sync, browse a bit. Hit home, open Twitter, browse a bit. Hit home, go back to Fallout Shelter, it starts up from the beginning (Enter Vault button, loading screen.) And since Fallout Shelter had to reload, it sometimes kills off other apps. In this example, it almost always kills off Reddit Sync, which sucks, because you lose your reading position/subreddit.Even though this phone is better than my Nexus 6, I DO NOT have this issue. Everything just stayed loaded in memory, even if it meant that the phone ran like crap.The more things you do on your phone, the more you will notice it.
It's not very expensive to get your battery replaced. 
Yeah that sounds like your car radio. I also had this issue with a cheap ebay Bluetooth dongle  on my garage pc to my garage stereo via a Bluetooth 3.5mm jack. Switched to a better dongle and the issue was fixed.  I have the Pioneer App Radio 3. Never had any issues with any of my friends phones or mine. I'm gonna try the contact trick as well, also going to clear the Bluetooth settings in the radio.  I'll report back if I figure it out.
These are the best images of the Note 5 that I've seen so far. Look at that curve!
I haven't been able to download the app. I got the email today and it isn't prompting me to download. I've tried the apk that someone posted in another thread and that doesn't seem to work. 
I'm not really sure why people like you are whining about the Note 5 not having a removable battery. There are things known as Portable Power Banks. Why won't people just learn to adapt to new technology and stop trying to cling to the old? Its really ridiculous. AS for SD cards its such a slow technology and prone to failing. Its not complete fail-safe as people seem to make it seem. There is a certain mount of read-writes a SD card can do before it suddenly dies on you.. and now where is that data? Cloud Storage is more reliable, try it. Sure you have to upgrade your data plan probably from a 1 GB plan (assuming you are doing the cheapest) but the pros of use of cloud storage clearly outranks an SD card in my opinion.
I want those icons! Is that a theme or a launcher?
Source? I put 3k size due to many leaked saying it will have around 3k battery. The Canadian Note 5 leaked also supposedly have the 3k battery.
Minus 1-4gb of app cache, depending how many apps you have and how much multimedia you do on it. 
So much this. Add that to the fact that they didn't release a VR set for it right away. sheer stupidity. 
Yes you need the charger it comes with for fast charging. I tried an older one and it doesn't fast charge, only standard charging. Although the cable doesn't matter, any one will do.
I'm always connected to my Wifi since I'm at home. Bluetooth is turned off. Unsure on the GPS... I haven't downloaded any GPS apps or anything yet.
The speaker is just not good.  I think Samsung figured that most of everyone these days is using bluetooth earpieces anyway and skimped on that bit of hardware.
I always found people with spare batteries weird. 
Maybe 2 years functional, but absolutely not 2 years of the same battery life duration. You start noticing battery life shortening in under 9 months usually, and people who truly need the absolute best battery life WILL notice. 
I actually didn't see this so I downloaded a widget. But thank you!

For what it's worth, it feels like Samsung and carriers (accept maybe for Verizon) are getting their act together when it comes to android os updates. I'm betting we'll see Android M running on the Note 5 by Christmas.
Touchwiz will require 3GB of RAM to run, the extra 1GB will be for facebook app.
No removable battery and no SD card slot means no upgrade from the Note3 for me.The note is supposed to be the professional line -- and I'm going to jump ship to another company that DOES provide those things if the rumors are true.If I'm going to give up my SD card and removable battery, I'd just as soon upgrade to the iPhone 6S Plus as I would to the Note 5.
All the specs besides the 4k display have me super intrigued. I'd rather see a refined 2k display than a first gen 4k.
You are right on lossing functionality. but honestly speaking I rarely used the S-Pen. The time it took to take it out, find the integrated button (it lacks something that makes it stand out physically so I don't have to turn the pen around and find it with my eyes), and the usual Touchwiz lag made it less than a pleasant experience. Even for taking notes it was just so much faster pressing home and opening Google Keep on my homescreen. I do miss split screen tough, but I'm not too worried since I can install xposed and add a splitscreen mod. I also still use the pen for drawing, it's a fantastic stylus I'll give you that :) 
Sorry its my fault. I put the image when a 'pro-leaker' leaked this image first. It was idea of /u/Lousy_Hater but after Note 5 was officially announced, i literally forgot that the image on the sidebar existed. I will fix this soon, but i have been really busy :(Another reason i put that specific image on the side was to test out the '[Dark Mode](https://dm.reddit.com/r/GalaxyNote5)'. If you click on the Dark Mode you will notice that the image has an alpha BG.
Because I'm one of the current Note enthusiasts and as much as I love the Note 4 I'd much rather be using a Note with the latest and greatest specs. Note users understand that Samsung opted to tell us to go fuck ourselves and is going for the iPhone users. I disagree that Samsung knew for a fact that making a Note 5 that isn't an iPhone/S6 clone wouldn't meet their sales goals. There are plenty of Note 3 users that were waiting for the Note 5 and now are looking for alternatives. Again. Samsung is taking a risk by telling current Note users to go fuck themselves. Personally I hope they fail miserably. 
It's a glass back, and as an Ex-XperiaZ1 user, I know removing glass backs for repairs more than usually doesn't end up with a model that looks exactly like before.
Gotta think towards the future. People can use S4, S5, Note 3, Note 4 for the next 5+ years. Each yeah less and less people are upgrading. Gotta give them reasons to upgrade now. Battery, storage size are the only way to get people to upgrade now. They run out of space or battery barely lasts half a day.
I preordered on Friday, it shipped on Saturday, in hand on Monday.Just a forewarning, if doing an upgrade you will have to call in to activate.  Auto activate is not working on all of them yet, at least yesterday.  HD Voice is not properly provisioned and Support says it should be ready by Friday.  You will only see Decline HD Voice or Block Video on the backend or in b2b.Picture: http://i.imgur.com/ciqmaA6.jpg?1I do feel I screwed up going 32gb without having that SD slot.  I do also miss my IR Blaster, but that just means my Note 3 or Note 4 will take up permanent residence near the TV I guess.Two HUGE likes so far, RAW shooting with the camera, and tapping to unlock with the fingerprint scanner.  Dear god is that soooo much better than the swipe method.  Angle no longer matters, so any orientation will do.  Still not sold on the pop up stylus though.
Yes, smaller non removable battery, no SD card slot and a better looking glass back that provides less functionality than the plastic one. 
I second this just go through your applications and delete what you don't use. Just be careful not to delete any files that enable your phone to function. If you don't know what it is, don't delete it. 
I had an issue with my [Schosche](http://www.walmart.com/ip/37551986?wmlspartner=wlpa&ampadid=22222222227027288072&ampwl0=&ampwl1=g&ampwl2=c&ampwl3=57667318488&ampwl4=&ampwl5=pla&ampwl6=81530165568&ampveh=sem) magnetic car mount causing the issue you describe, there is a metal piece I put in my case and if it is over the wireless charging area it will not recognize a wireless charge properly.  I moved the metal piece up just under the camera, that seems to have fixed the issue for me.  Thought it was worth mentioning...
So what is the motion effect? I have applied various sizes of wallpaper and have observed no motion effect at all
I have the LG G4, if you don't care about the stylus, it's a kick ass device.
Very pissed. Every update has hit my battery life hard on the Note 4. The only reason I'm alright with that is because I can swap batteries. In 6 months you'll see a great number of Note 5 users complain about battery life without a way to mitigate it. I also use the IR blaster on a daily bases.I see no reason to upgrade. It'd just be stupid to do so. 
How long did you go with IPv6 disabled? On a related note:I had found [this](http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/nsp/ipv6/54641) a few weeks back when I was researching Android IPv6 issues with another device.  The guy named Lorenzo posting on that thread is an engineer who works for Google.Allegedly, Samsung filters or blocks IPv6 multicast packets (which IPv6 makes extensive use of) in firmware during screen-off time to conserve battery life. If your router has any tunable IPv6 settings (most consumer stuff won't), you can look at adjusting RA intervals and stuff to see if maybe you can keep your device connected.[This](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7048) RFC provides some tuning guidelines if you're able to make those changes on your router.
Here's what I finaly did.Downloaded SideSync 3.from here. http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2731571Installed and was prompted to download DirectX. I did making sure to uncheck Bing Bar crapware. SideSync 3.installed them prompted me to update to 4.which I did successfully. 
Not sure but as a suggestion. You have 60fps option on regular video. You can take all your videos in this setting and then edit your slow mo clips really smoothly on your computer for the times you want that. But to answer your question I think the iPhone has the note 5 beat out of box on slow mo
What's wrong with the phone you have now?  I've done a lot of searching and can't find anything coming that is an answer to the Note 5.  I guess Sony might be coming out with something maybe.  I have a Note 3 and it works fine.  Frankly, many of the shortcomings of the Note 5 don't bother me that much except for the non-removable battery.  I don't swap batteries throughout the day but as time goes on, they wear out.  I'm not buying a new phone every year.I considered upgrading my 3 to a 4 but even that's not a big deal in terms of upgrade.
Man, kinda figured that would be the case. Thank you, I'll probably just pass on the wireless charging. 
I'm not sure, as I'm using an s6. I'd forgotten that I was on this sub when I posted that comment. I frequent r/galaxynote5 because I'm looking to switch over from my s6 to a note5 (phone provider is letting me do this and I'd love the bigger screen of the note5, which wasn't out yet when I got my s6).
Not to add another me too response but I just picked up the Samsung charger today and mine is doing the exact same thing..Starts charging then the blue light on the base flashes blue..
I took an ancient Atrix 2 in. I was worried the battery wouldn't hold a charge long enough for the rep to test it!  Worked fine, got my Note 5, $20gift card, and a Samsung charging pad.  Samsung offered a $45 gift card that I applied to the taxes. Think I was out 25 and change OTD!
I'm on ATT, I've already loaded up all of my apps and taken a few pictures and videos. I currently have 48.37GB free.I recommend the 64GB - remember you can film in 4k (30fps) or 1080p60fps - that sucks your storage space up pretty quick.
I agree. I just gave what was shown on the card on screen. I can only assume that giving the digital last 4 would have worked.
Verizon also has Galaxy Note5 on the back
It explains that I have 1 hr and 3mins of sot. I woke up at 11 am and used it until 6ish. That'd unacceptable. And like I said, no games, pure black wallpapers and screens, wifi scanning off, no google now, no nfc. 
Please don't try, you'll break it before you get it out, I know from experience :(     I think it gets stuck on some kind of push button that let's the phone know the pen is inside. That's just my theory though.
The G Pro 2 and G Pro 3 supported AT&ampT 4G bands. If you get it unlocked it will work on 2G and 3G on T-Mobile but definitely not 4G IIRC
I'd be pissing my pants with excitement if they didn't remove the IR blaster and use cheap plastic back. Maybe I'll find a way to cope. Maybe I'll try something different this year.before you call me a [expletive censored I'm not sure how reddit works anymore], just remember that this phone will probably retail for very near $1,00and I have every right to be upset about losing functionality. The Note should offer more functionality than other phones - the active digitizer display is the number one extra feature, but stripping away other extras is just insulting and unnecessary. 
Anyone know when we will see the first wireless quick charge 2 compatible accessories arrive?
Yeah it's about 24 hours for me right now, and it's definitely getting better on that, even after some Angry Birds 2
Mine from AT&ampT was sealed up.  It also came with a sim tool and extra S-pen tips in addition to the usual books, charger, and headphones.
I agree with it being mostly optimizations as well, but Samsung didn't realize this (or at least get it right) until this year with the GS6/Edge. All that I was saying is that the processor in the Note 4 is a year old, compared to this practically new one in the Note 5 (and GS6/Edge)
I know what it said. Looking forward to your post about your terrible battery life in a few weeks. :)
I personally like the Note 5 and S6 Edge+. I'll be buying one of them in the next week.But this article...was just...wow. I personally don't understand how people can be so invested in protecting a brand as if they're your friend or family. These are companies that are standing on the forefront of capitalism trying to get every cent they can in the world. Every one of these companies, especially one as huge as Samsung, see's customers as no more than a way to fill their bank account. If they make good products because of that then awesome! But a huge part of why companies make these amazing revels of technology is due to the complaints and criticisms of the people who aren't going to buy their phones. This drives companies to try and cater to every demographic they can. But this type of article accomplishes nothing. It is written as if the author was personally offended when someone didn't want to buy a Samsung device because it didn't have an SD card and felt he needed to tell the whole world that they're wrong. This doesn't push companies further at all. 
Look up what makes Samsung Pay so different. Google wallet is useless in most places. Wont have that problem with Samsung pay as it doesn't need NFC.
Turn on daydream mode and set it to daydream when charging. It should charge all the way through.I'm assuming that when the note 5 goes to sleep that the wireless charging goes to sleep with it.
Are they mp3s with a variable bitrate? Try converting some audio to mp3 vand see how that plays. So far this kind of audio file that's given me issues.
I got the Zagg glass from best buy. I normally like to search for something around 2bucks on Amazon. But the Zagg glass is actually very good and a perfect fit. That and the lifetime warranty makes it worth the 4some bucks they charge for it, specially without any insurance on a leased phone.
But flipping a USB c  in the wrong way is quite a bit easier. I've been a note owner for years and not once have I ever tried to put the pen in backwards. I get it, it definitely should not go in backwards and break the phone. But how hard is it to just not do it? Besides for people doing it just to see if it actually breaks the phone I haven't heard of this actually happening by accident. It's weird, I agree that it's a dumb thing and shouldn't have happened. But I have to play the defensive side because of how insane the reaction has been. 
It uses nfc when it can.
Had the 4, now have the 5. The 5 is much smoother and quicker. All around the best phone I have owned. If you can live without the SD, go with the 5. If you need the SD, the 4 is still a great phone.
There are some examples here: http://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/galaxys6/theme-service/But you can't browse the full theme store without the phone.
Fuck man I love that sleek design. Can I get more pics? Totally worth losing the SD card and removable battery. More pics plz?
It doesn't have anything to do with butthurt. Its just wrong. There is no replacement for a replaceable battery. With this logic simply charging your phone simulates having a removable battery because it charges your phone in a short amount of time. No. 
how is the feature of being able to jot a note with the screen off? 
it looks glossy, does it get smudgy with fingerprints? Seriously considering this case in smoke black.
Your s pen also didn't break inside the phone?
So what features, exactly, do you use by breaking the device by putting the pen in backwards? All pen capabilities? Just some of them?What can you do with the pen anyway? Does it do everything a touch on the screen can do?I really want one of these phones, but I want the details. 
Yootech on Amazon never have halo effects. They are slightly smaller, but still cover the entire display area. They are all I buy. Zagg are seriously overpriced big box junk. They prey on those who NEED IT NOW at 4x the cost of others. Nope. Get a Yootech. They are like $9 and perfect.
I just got 33 Mbps on AT&ampT. The network here in town and to be getting faster, I remember getting low to mid teens a few months ago. 
I agree.  Plus since it has no removable battery it will only get less an less battery on time within a couple months. 
This exactly.  5 is much superior to the 4 except sd and battery if that is important to you.  This is truly the best phone I have ever owned by a large margin.
Samsung will not officially replace your device should this happen to you. It is not covered under warranty.You may find luck in returning to your carrier/store and hopefully they will just allow you to exchange it, but I also assume that most carrier insurance options also don't allow for using the device the wrong way as a valid exchange reason, and will therefore either suggest you take advantage of insurance if you got it, or not do anything.All in all, looks like YMMV.
I put my S5 and my wife's S6 up to my Note 5 and physically it's downright shocking how similar they are (FYI. the S5 and S6 are basically identical).  Width-wise there's barely any difference at all, a millimeter or two probably, it's height where there's a noticeable difference, and it's just not that much either: it's a bit less than the height of the capacitive button area actually, maybe half an inch at most.  The difference is so small in fact that I was having some doubts in the store about whether it was even worth it... I always wanted the bigger screen of the Note series since I'd had S series for a couple of years... I ultimately went with the Note because there IS of course a difference, but more because of the increased screen density and the fact that you can actually see a bit more content at once.Thickness-wise I think the Note might be a hair thinner, but not remotely enough to matter, and my wife thinks it weighs a little less than the S6 but to my hand there's really no difference.It's amazing to me what shrinking some bevels to almost nothing can do :)It fits in the back pocket of my jeans with any problem whatsoever, or the front shirt pocket of a t-shirt.  You really need to see how it feels in your hand more than anything else, especially coming from a relatively small phone.  I can tell you for certain that for the use cases you outlined, the extra screen real estate is going to blow you away.  And,  between the S6 and Note 5, as I mentioned  before, you'll actually see a little more content on the screen with the Note 5 due to the way they implemented scaling versus the S6, physical size aside.  It isn't a night-and-day difference, but you DO notice it.TLDR If the Note 5 fits in your hand good then go for it.  If it doesn't, then I'd bet the S6 won't fit much better, so you might as well go with the Note 5 then anyway :)
Samsung usually has some colors that release later.  All a calculated marketing/sales thing.  If you want one now you get black or white.  I did see edge plus in gold 
Are you restarting afterward? It definitely works on the N5 I did it on mine. Are you replacing DPI with 3 digits? 
Did disabling messages and/or messages backup and sync adversely affect your ability to send and receive SMS? I use textra, and I haven't disabled the stock messaging stuff because I'm afraid it will shut down textra....Any clues on this?  I use texting for work almost all day so I can't really just test it out, I'll risk losing a client message.Thanks
Make sure your app is up to date.  I couldn't watch 60fps either, but an update came out a few days ago that fixed it.  I had to manually update though as it never auto popped up.
I wouldn't worry about it then unless you're getting terrible battery life
Absolutely loved my note2, fiercely love my note4.Dissapointed most by the lack of a 128gb note 5 variant. Dissapointed second most by the lack of an IR blaster, I must be in the minority, but I use it as a universal remote at home, work and on vacation.I keep my old handsets as hand-me-downs to my son who is currently rocking my old note2.  Without a removable battery that's dampened. (Not sure about replacement feasibility/cost)Cooler design on the 5.  Slight upgrade on cpu/gpu should make gaming better. Plethora of cheap external chargers help, external USB storage may help in a pinch.  I'm patiently waiting on note 5 active specs as samsung has done the impossible and made a new note that I am thus far completely uninterested in. If the active comes with 128GB and a larger battery, maybe I'll consider, don't know, it's a tough decision, and screw Samsung for making that a tough decision. This should be a no brainer. Removing so many features for no reason. IR and 128GB I would  have outright. 
Yup, that I know.  I am talking about the Note 4's calendar. You could write directly on top of it and it would be your own writing.
So keyboards are coming back now? Did anyone really asl for this? 
Oh God you are so right. 5gb of my storage on my s5 is taken up by cache and I only have like 6gb of apps...
There are things known as portable power banks annnd... a normal person would just get the battery in the note 5 replaced.
Alright, the pre-registration is only for people who want to be notified when the Note and Edge Plus are available for purchase AND get a free year of Netflix. In order to get the free year of Netflix, you MUST fill out that form. Just expect it next Friday (in store) so you don't get your hopes up.
I think everyone can stop acting like the SD card, removable battery and IR blaster things are revealing news.  They're confirmed through multiple photos as being gone.  Anyone still holding out for those things at this point is just delusional.But the battery size and CPU are still up for grabs, since all anyone has is the word of random, faceless assembly line workers.
That too! With that crazy glass on glass design, I'd put a case on it right away. Better to save the design rather than see it shatter in a drop. I get that. 
Probably could use half a straw just like when it's inserted backwards. I wouldn't though,  you'll probably have an easier time getting it fixed under warranty as it'll look less you accidentally snapped it. 
Verizon is the only carrier that does not sticker their Samsung devices. this was also the case with the note 4 and the s6 and s6 edge. no idea why
Happened to me on day one, no drops, had the s view case on it the second it was in my hand. It's a small, thin scratch but it's very noticeable against any white displayed on the screen. I'm just going to wait until my 14 day in store return period is up and call and complain that my battery won't hold a charge. It'll take an hour of my time to go through all the rancid troubleshooting TMO makes you do before issuing a warranty replacement. The phone is so new that they are pretty much guaranteed to only have new replacement handsets to send out. Gonna put that sealed battery to work for me! 
Do you have any issues removing your S-pen?  That seems to be the most common gripe on the amazon reviews for this case...
I like Samsung Pay, but I like my root apps more. It's all a compromise though.
My phone has been in my pocket for less than an hour, it has lost 6% battery doing nothing, while being connected to wifi for 85% of the past hour. Not sure what the issue is, but there certainly is one.
I'm not sure. Right now I'm using Zagg. They have a lifetime warranty so you can always keep getting replacements. But mine has a halo effect right now and on the sides you see some rainbow colors. lol. I'm gonna get mine re-done tomorrow at Best Buy.
I speculate that its too early to be adopted. I was kind of upset because I want to future proof it but then I though, I have so many cables at home and at work, why do I want to buy more cables. And of course fast charging. The oneplus takes about 3 hours to charge. I have a fast charger with my m8 and honestly it's great when you have to charge it for ~2before heading out to wherever. 
Plus, if you root verizon (at least at the moment), your phone won't start.  Verizon and AT&ampT put some additional logic in Knox to disable your phone if you root it.
Can't wait to try it out.  I finally was able to update my SP app with beta access, but I don't have any US Bank or BoA cards.  The main card I use is Chase, so I'll just have to wait about a month.
Think the CEO used social media saying so.
Samsung Pay will work on nearly all magnetic card readers, so it won't require NFC.
The only noticeable difference I saw is that you can write Snotes on your black locked screen with the stylus and it will save them. No need to wake up or unlock the device. 
I got an otterbox commuter for $4at the Verizon store and a tempered glass screen protector. Case fits perfectly and is honestly pretty thin. Anazing protection. I also use a tumi Astor case that is thinner and still offers good protection. Both have good grip 
This is true, they are putting emphasis on phone appearance and marketing because they think that's what people who read their articles want/care about. They may be right for all I know, I don't read articles on The Verge very often at all and I certainly don't have web analytics for the site to get an idea of their typical audience. I'm just saying it doesn't appear to be written to appeal to people that care about hardware and features more than appearances. /u/rsplatpc is exactly right when they say the article reads like a PR release, that's essentially what it is. However, appearances don't make a good phone, they just make it aesthetically pleasing. You could design the most beautiful smartphone in existence, but if it doesn't work properly, has design flaws, bends when you sit down with it in your pocket, or runs Windows 98 instead of modern Android/iOS, it's not a good phone.
Yes, I'm using it too and it works great!So far only one place I have tried has failed... Lowes Home Improvement (MCX member) and it wasn't a big surprise because LoopPay transactions have also failed for me at Lowes.Every other place I have tried has worked great:* 711 - Works (MST)* World Market - Works (MST)* Aldi - Works (MST)* Kroger - Works (MST)* Petsmart - Works (MST)* CVS (this was a surprise since they block NFC and my LoopPay transactions never worked there) - Works (MST)* Family Dollar - Works (MST)* Dollar Tree - Works (MST)* Krispy Kreme Donuts - Works (MST)* Harbor Freight Tools - Works (MST)* Total Wine - Works (MST)* Lowes Home Improvement (Appears to work, but fails after accepting transaction amount) - Fails* Walgreens - Works (NFC)* Target - Works (MST)* Walmart - Works (MST)Edit: I have noticed that I have not been receiving any transaction history or notifications on Samsung Pay for the card I'm using. I'm assuming that feature may not be enabled yet. 
First, go to Chrome settings and turn merge tabs and apps offSecond, no...not by default
How do you know that? What LTE bands are used in the US?
The S6 and S6 edge both just had a price drop. I have the Note 4 right now though I am considering S6. While I'll miss the battery life I don't use the S Pen. They were out of the S6 when I went to get a phone and settled on the Note 4. 
I'm going to say that's probably not right.  I got mine at the Sprint store and there was no mention of this, nor any signs.
Each display setting looks different on my phone 
No worries! And btw the battery seems great on your phone I can see nothing wrong with 12hours standby and with 11 hours remaining. You're probably just not using your phone as much that's why your SoT is low.
I really hate myself. I sat down for a few minutes when this pengate shit really hit the fan a week or so ago and tried to think what would be thin and flat that somebody could stick in the silo I couldn't think of anything at all. I could have made this video if I had a brain that actually worked.
Heyyyyy... I'll like to try an help you.. Seeing as I am coming from the note 3 an then note 4 both I owned for more than a year each.  I loved the note 3 alot especially since it didn't have that stupid curved screen it was easy to get a tempered glass screen protector that's maybe the only thing that stood out when u upgraded to note 4. Now I was able to find a glass screen protector that had no halo screen effect after couple trail an error. Ok aside from that... Everything is near perfect... I can tell u right now... The 3 main features that they took out I used them everyday. I use my IR blaster to control all my TVs an my Xbox an cable box's. I using my 64gb memory card an I also bought at extended battery for long travels.... an after a year I bought a 3rd party regular battery because I am a heavy user an it didn't survive the whole day by the time I got home from work. Now about the look of the note 5. It's beautiful I wish the note 4 looked like that.... However... Who cares? What the phone looks like... A smart person gets a case for there phone which I have a couple of... Now I can also tell u.. That this phone is very powerful... I played almost all the most popular games an multi task may apps an different launchers etc... Its powerful enough so the 4gb ram sounds amazing but that's definitely won't of been a reason I would of upgraded for. The camera is same 16mp.. To tell u honestly I wanted to get the note edge but I was waiting for this year when I guessed they would of bring out a more better note with both side edges... Guess I was wrong an they made it the worst note ever an didnt even come with an edge version... I only recently got into this vr gear an I feel so cool... Its really fun working an not having to check my phone to see what exactly was that notification for.. Sucks once again... Note 5 has downgraded so much 
The Note 2 will not go in backwards, seems odd they changed the design where it can now be inserted easily backwards. Sure people should pay attention to what they are doing, but still seems like atleast something that was overlooked in the design.
I don't like covers or I would totally go that route. I'll probably end up getting the official Samsung case that just snaps on the back just like the s-view one without the cover. I think it's only up for Pre order right now though. 
I had this case for my Note 3 and I loved it.  After about 18 months of removing it daily to swap batteries it did separate at the edges, but I doubt you would have this problem with the note 5.  http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-SUPCASE-Unicorn-Premium-Protective/dp/B013D247KU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&ampqid=1440539883&ampsr=8-1&ampkeywords=supcase+beetle+note+5
I been reading it while working hard at work. Probably get this phone soon and look into pocket friendly cases. I usually just get a leather pouch for my phone and remove it during use but the note 5 is glass so will consider other options.
The note 5 is unique as it addresses the concerns of those who want a larger screen and productivity features. While the Spen is cool, very seldom do i come across a user who actually uses it frequently or to its full potential. Samsung is alienating their  user base by excluding expandable memory and removable batteries. This brings the note 5 really close to the iPhone 6 Plus and the Nexus 6. I will always favor a device that runs stock android to a device that uses Samsung's Touchwiz. Though IOS is limited in comparison to Android, iPhone 6 Plus is an outstanding device with all the features 95% of the population really ever needs. I would also consider the LG G4 if I were you. Excellent device at a reasonable cost. 
For me, I like a bigger screen so there is no competition between the s6 and the note 5, it's note 5 all the way. My question is whether to get the s6 active(which may have a bigger battery than the note 5,  our get a Moto x pure, or get the note 5.
There is some speculation that long term battery health could be impacted negatively by repeated fast charging. Charge using wireless on your night stand and desk if you're worried about it
Glad I returned this thing today for a full refund. The Samsung lady at Best Buy was shocked. Oh well, I explained everything.Back to my Note 4 w/3 batteries and IR port. Love it.
I have 14 apps open right now including relay for Reddit and Chrome and maps. I just ran to the back apps in my recent apps and none of them are reloading. I'm even doing this as I am responding to you going back and forth to try and get the same effect you're getting. It's not happening. Check to see if you have power saver on because if you have a note 5 and put it in power saver there is no icon or anything up top to let you know you have it in power saver mode. Just the notification tab and quick settings.
We won't know what software and new s-pen features are on it until Thursday.  It's a Note phone. Samsung will have some cool stuff to show us.
That's fine but it doesn't compare positively to other phones on the market right now. It might be an improvement from a previous generation but that doesn't make it a contender for current flagships.This issue has stalled my upgrade until Samsung can roll out a fix. It's EXTREMELY satisfying to multitask between 6-8 apps and have no loss of context or load times. It makes multitasking in Android absolutely phenomenal. My Z3 might have an older 801 but it has 3GB of well managed RAM so I play Hearthstone all the time and switch to email, hangouts, chrome, sync pro, etc and I always jump immediately back into Hearthstone without having to sign back in or anything. It's like I never left the game. It's amazing.
I was willing to overlook everything else, if it just had an IR blaster and 350minimum mah battery. Siiiiigh
It's definitely glass. 
The only burn-in I've ever seen on a samsung phone past about 2013 was on display models that show the same screen on max brightness for 12 hours a day.  They've gotten progressively more resistant to it each generation.
I also got the Zaag and it's halo free and near perfect. I put it on in the bathroom after running the shower for a few min to get it steamy and prevent any floating dust. With the lifetime warranty I think the Zaag is the best deal and it feels premium 
I want a better chipset than the one in the S6. And a better camera. Might as well just AHHH AHHH AAAAAAAAAHHH! MOTHER FUCK! MOTHER FUCK! SAMSUNG, NOOOOOO! NOOOOOOOOO! THAT'S  MY BUTT! THAT'S MY BUTT! STOP ! STOP! RAPE!  RAPE!Dammit
In one of the threads over in /r/tmobile, someone said most of the stores are getting 32GB, but one got a bunch of 64GB ones.I'm hoping a store near me has a 64GB because there's no frickin way what's left of the storage on the 32GB model is going to be able to handle me.
The 64GB Black and White (no Gold for the Note5 on T-Mo) got shipped to a limited number of stores. I called over 1in my area on Friday afternoon and only one of them had the 64GB and it was the white model (I wanted black). You can call around and see, but good luck. One of the reps claimed that it'll be a week or two before the 64GB will probably come in stock.If you want to do JOD and don't want to wait, just get the 32GB and jump to the 64GB before the end of September to take advantage of the deal. If you're not doing JOD, just order it from the website.
I've previously used Otterboxes for every phone I've had. I was tired of the bulkiness they added, so I decided to switch. I'm currently using a Pelican Voyager. It's much slimmer and lighter, though I miss the port covers on the Otterbox.Plus, the Pelican has a lifetime warranty on the holster and case with free replacement and free shipping. My buddy called when his clip broke on the holster for his S5 and they sent him a whole new case, no questions asked, no proof required. Pretty awesome...
WTH?  It's too early to flash a rom!
You can change the grid setting(4x4,4x5,5x5) by touch and hold or pinch in on the home screen using the Samsung's default launcher, it is the lower right icon
The stuff you see in the media is bullshit. I have the note 5 and I have a nexus 6 my note beats my nexus hands down. The only way I could replicate the stuff in the videos is if I put my note in power saving mode. I'm sure that's what they are doing also because there is no indicator showing you're in power saving mode. The note does not kill apps running in the background unless it's in power saver. When a new Samsung comes out you always have that select group of people who always looks for something to be wrong with the device because THEY don't like Samsung phones. They are the minority (look at Samsung sales) that hate touchwiz blah blah blah. Get the phone. You won't be sorry. 
They fail after entering all card info for adding a card.. when hitting save you get this.. http://imgur.com/a/Y9agBEdit: this happens with each card I try.. all Mastercards. I don't have a visa to try
Settings, device, applications, application manager, tap and app, disable
The fix for me is just not turning on WiFi. Haven't had WiFi on for the last two days and my cell standby has dropped to below 5% from around 21% over an entire charge. Now it's android os and play services keeping my phone awake. 
So is 32GB the only option?If so Samsung is fucking shooting themselves in the foot. This may be the worst Note yet.
Pre-ordered the note 5, i don't really know how much i'll use the stylus but i honestly feel like the edge would drive me insane due to the way i hold my phone, Then again maybe accidentally pressing apps/other stuff on the edge doesn't really happen honestly haven't really used a edge yet. 
Huh? All I have is the usual option to turn off the percentage. The icon itself is always there with no way to turn off. 
Yea, only my flash and heartbeat sensor had protective film. The camera lens did not.
Well can a tiny lapse of judgement really be considered 'dumb'.I think you are disparaging your fellow human beings here. The fact is its entirely too easy to do. Would I put it in 99% of the time correctly, Yes. Will I be distracted some day and accidentally put in in backwards breaking it? The odds are pretty high.I've probably put my note 2 pen in backwards 5-1times out of the hundreds perhaps even thousands of times I've used it.
Yeah the dual SIM won't be coming to the U.S., but every reference to 410mah makes me happy.  
assuming your local best buy carries the chargers, buy one there and try it. Their return policy is simple enough that you'll have no issues returning the charger if it doesn't resolve your problem.
I just got a screenshieldz one and it doesn't have a halo effect, but it also doesn't fit perfectly. The screen is completely covered, but the area up top and down by the home button isn't covered completely. It may just be a function of being difficult to design for perfectly but regardless I'll probably keep it. 
I'm not sure I would go so far as to call it stupid.  Granted it is a stupid thing to do, and as the owner of the phone you probably won't do it...but the fact that incorrectly inserting the stylus  breaks a feature is definitely worth noting and thus publicizing.  People who have kids or who might hand their phone off to a friend or family member who just might happen to incorrectly stow the stylus...should at least be made aware of the potential for harm it can cause.  
I'm laughing with you about this, but I would have expected such a simple mistake to be less catastrophic than it apparently is. I guess nobody on the development team ever tried sticking the pen in backwards.
Basic mode should provide extremely accurate colors. If not, I'd get a replacement. Mine looks great.
I've had my phone off the charger for 1 1/2 hrs now.  Cell standby is #1 battery drain with 17%,  2nd is screen which is 1% my battery is at 89%. Screen on time is 8 minutes.  This is ridiculous. 
What brand/kind of headphones? If you got charged $10and they said they're 'free', maybe there's some kind of rebate involved. If not, I'd go back and get my money back, unless of course you like the headphones. 
Any scratches? And what color note 5? Just curious ^^
The CPU and extra RAM is huge.  Then there's built in wireless charging that doesn't mess with the fitting of a case.  Plus you get 64gb of memory you can use for apps finally instead of only 32gb.
I had a day of moderate usage today, played around with some things even, and as of 5:3PM I still have 54%.  I got up about 7AM and other than bluetooth streaming some music didn't use the phone until about 830.   It says I have 6 hours and 3minutes left.  Screen time on for the day is 2 hours and 46 minutes.  In the middle of the afternoon I turned wifi off just to see what the cell radio would do to the battery, It was operating without wifi for about two hours, and the cell radio drained 8% of my battery.  That seems a little high compared to other phones but overall not that concerning.Google play services zapped 5%, including a bunch of GPS pings?  THis makes no sense to me.  I did search for my location one time this morning to add my work as a trusted location, maybe that did it.  I used google now all of twice to check the cards for a package I'm waiting on, and yet that used more battery than the substantial amount of redditing I did on the shitter.So overall I'm not surprised, no one is going to call this phone a battery giant or anything, but based on what I'm seeing so far, I think most people will get through the day without any charging.
Auto all day. My screen timeout is set to 1 minute, and my touch key duration lights are set to 1.5 seconds (not that the touch key lights zap much juice).  The other goofy samsung display options are still on (smart stay for example) I do use amoled black or dark themes on most sites and apps I use though.  
This has to do with being on CDMA, not the phone.  Get on  a GSM carrier.  What you are asking for is afeature  to deal with outdated  tower techin your area.  
Unless it's not.  Currently, I have 3 lines for $145 a month:  The plan is 70minutes that we don't use, unlimited texts.  My line has unlimited data for $29.99, one line has no data, third line has a 2GB/$3plan.    I use about 30GB a month, but let's say I drop to 8GB and we have a 10GB share everything plan.   Plan cost is $80/month to start. 2 Smartphones @ $15/month ea  1 basic phone @ $20/month (WTF??)  My wife has an iPhone 6 $27/month  I have a Note 4  @29/month  I won't count the basic phone because I buy them outright.    So, my new plan would go from $145 a month with one line having unlimited data to $187.  I've gone from a total 2-year cost of $388(assuming I pay $200/per phone at contract renewal) to $4,488, and I've lost an extremely valuable unlimited data plan.    The good news is, Verizon has confirmed that they are not getting rid of subsidies and contracts, just a dirty lie told by USA Today. 
I like it. I instantly noticed how good Samsungs display are. The phone is sleek and I downloaded a theme that gets rid of that ugly green/blue theme Samsung uses. Also there's no lag, the phone is fast. Camera is awesome and the size is just perfect to hold in my hand. 
I'm confused by this too since the S6 and S6 active both still have it blasters.  Someone confirmed in another thread that it is inexpensive technology so it must have been a space issue.  Even that doesn't make must sense to me since this phone is going to be the love child of the S6 and the note 4 and both those phones fit the ir blaster.
It does look weird, almost like it's the plural of note, NoteS
Yes it supports both qi and powermat. The Samsung fast wireless charger is qi. I have used it on a couple differen r qi pads.
My galaxy s6 edge suffered from constant scratching over the smallest of things. It might be the glass they're using?
[Here HD pic of one of the edge](http://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-note-5-leaked-photos-629160/). The sim-card slot is visible on top but no SD-card slot.
Here is a non-mobile link: http://gsmarena.com/verizons_galaxy_note_5_to_house_exynos_7420_4gb_of_ram-news-13313.php ^[Sourcecode](https://github.com/Kharms/untouchedURL) ^| ^[Feedback?](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=untouchedURL&ampampsubject=untouchedURL%20feedback)
Did you try out the TouchWiz? Is it the same or are there any major differences?
The most critical issue is maintaining a GPS lock. Half the time it is unable to get a lock and other times it just randomly loses a lock even in the middle of nowhere. Also, I have noticed stability has been decreasing and needing to reboot almost daily now.I've got a pretty good bumper on it, however I have dropped it down a flight of carpeted stairs a couple of times as well as on to the floor a few other times. I don't know if the issues are due to normal wear or age or if it's because it just can't tolerate being dropped a few times in a case.
I didn't say there  was a huge speed difference. In fact, I didn't say there was a speed difference at all. I never once said that the Note 4 is slow compared to the Note5. What there is, is a smoothness and more polished feel to TouchWiz on the Note5 that is not present on the Note 4 running the latest 5.1.1. Is the Note 4 slow? Not at all. Is the Note 5 marginally quicker? Yes. And you're forgetting that the Note5 has an extra gig of RAM over the S6 you've been mentioning. 
It's a good thing you can change literally anything on this phone. Such as your launcher...Nova Launcher lets you change it to any grid size. 4x4, 5x5, 6x6, 4x8, etc
Yeah that is my hope too, I'm not going to be able to eliminate the wallet but if Samsung pay works, I'll be able to move from a big wallet and phone to a phone with a wallet case containing my license, a backup credit card, and maybe a twenty dollar bill for emergencies.
Question. I'm getting mine today did you use it till it died and then put it on the charger? Or did you charge it then use it?
I do manually set my brightness. I keep it at 60-65% during the day and 30-35 late at night and when I wake up. Just a habit of mine.
Samsung pay does not use nfc. It emulates an actual card swipe
Diztronic and Yootech. Best $18 you will ever spend and no fiddling with grossly overpriced $59 flap things. I have the Samsung case/flap (the one with the solid clear front) and it's going back tomorrow. I hate it and at $64 after tax, I feel like Samsung should have included some lube in the box. Yikes, it maybe cost them .84 cents to make. Nope.
Just to clarify not my language used.
Yeah I really like doing that too and then going to apps and themes and then selecting WallpaperPick 
It's sad.  I would pay DAMN good money for a green S6 or Note 5.  I have no desire to own an Edge though.
Coming from the abysmal battery life of the 2014 Moto X, the Note 5 will be a welcome upgrade for me. Also the fact that I can charge my phone with fast charging in a ludicrously short amount of time helps me not give a fuck about battery mAh size. It's exactly how I tolerate my 1.5-2 hours of SOT on my Moto X. 
Really?  I should point out that was off charger around 11 PM and this was through the morning, all on very low brightness.  (I turn it almost all the way down before I goto sleep)
I didnt have to, it was already there when I logged into my samsung account. I did see there was a setting for it on my phone though.
I would call myself a power user. What  does that mean? I travel for work so my staples are power draining gps and wifi tethering. Most of my emails get sent by phone. I routinely go 8-10hours screen on time. I am often away from a power source for 16hours, and at times 3hours.I have upgraded my phone every year, starting from the note 1 to 2,3,4.  I get that I'm a niche user, and the note 1 was a niche phone, the 2 less so, and now at the 5th iteration the note is just another flagship.I can pay ??20more for 128gb. I can get over the ir blaster. But a single battery? That's a lifestyle change. It's like having an 8mile range electric car as your only car. Except it's not because I can always just call an ??ber instead... Unless of course my phone is dead
Well in comparison to the Note 4, pretty much everything. Build quality, software, camera, processor, ram, but I don't like that it's basically a carbon copy of the S6/Edge.
It seems to me that OneNote writing has a noticeable lag compared to writing in S-Note or Action memo. Something about writing in OneNote just feels off
http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/a16143/type-c-usb-phones-are-coming/ note 5 would have been a good tipping point.  This article from June 22 sums up my opinion on it.... Language from Google has strongly implied that all its Nexus devices from here on out will sport the port as well. But the real tipping point though is likely to be the Galaxy Note 5 due out this fall. So far it's just a rumor, but Samsung's flagship giant phone is enormously popular, and if it bears a Type-C port (there's no reason for it not to), it will instantly increase both the general awareness of the fantastic new port, and the number of Type-C cables out there in the world.
I can definitely look pass no SD with 4100mah battery 
My son's S6 Edge has some nasty burn-in... it's so bad that I may have to pay the insurance deductible and get him a new one... so it CAN happen, though it seems to be extremely rare. I'm not especially worried about it and I'd say you shouldn't either... but I'd definitely get insurance if you don't have it already, just in case. 
I noticed yesterday that i have already got a scratch. id call it minor because its only noticeable when you look at the phone at a particular angle and doesnt affect my viewing but i am a little frustrated. i have been babying the phone as well, got a case yesterday, and have taken really good care of it since friday. now im rushing to get a screen protector
And, it seems to only show checked anything you've disabled with the app itself so it's easy to tell what you need to re-enable separate from things you disabled thorough app manager and can leave disabled.Also, another FYI: there are some things connected in odd ways... for example, disabling Smart Manager also disabled your Battery settings applet... that surprised me.  A few others I'm forgetting now, though easily fixed thankfully. 
lol, it's just ridiculous, not a single positive rumor was confirmed. no 410mah battery, no possible dual sim models that offer sd card support, no IR blaster too (from what i can see).
It all comes down to do you want the edge or a pen. The specs are &gt9identical. Do you need a case? Go with note otherwise it's the same thing. I chose note 5 if that matters? 
Took about 24 hours for me.  At some point click on the Samsung pay app and it will ask you to update to the full app.
If it is a glass back, it wouldn't be.  Well, not easily. It would be like the iPhone -- possible to take apart with the right tools, but you're not going to do it yourself unless you have a good reason and are willing to void the warranty.
For my car I have a Audiovox Qi charger, which I bought at Fry's. The Note 5 barely squeezes into it, but it works good and holds it firmly.  For my desk, I have a Itian charging pad, which I think I got from Amazon as was quite cheap. Both have auto shutoff and the Audiovox has a light to indicate if the charger is not ready because it's too hot, which happens a lot here in Texas. Sometimes I have to wait a few minutes after getting in my car before I can put the phone on the charger. I could mostly eliminate that by taking the charger with me when I get out of the car, but I'm too lazy. I don't have a fast charging power bank, but aside from Samsung, Anker makes them and you can get them for a reasonable price on Amazon.
There are times when they come in really handy. Traveling to New Zealand, I used up my battery during the day here in the States and overnight on the flight, and when we landed at 6am I swapped batteries and was good to go for the entire day in Auckland. Spare battery chargers don't force you to be tethered to a cable all the time you can tether the charger to the cable and use your phone normally. Also if you're using USB OTG you can't charge at the same time.
I guess i havent looked at the details, but i thought it had enough amps and volts to charge laptops... eventually will be using the same cable to charge any device
It's better than my s6 for sure,  but I still get keyboard lag and overall system lag. It's a bummer
There is a good reason why they won't release it in Europe. Before the release today they made a survey. Turns out noone is interested in an iPhone lookalike with non-removable battery. 
I don't know where you got that idea. It uses both NFC and MST... You can choose which it uses by placing it near the specific reader. 
Is advanced calling on or off? And how much battery life are you getting?
http://imgur.com/V3XsFjUUsually people really dislike my setup - but let me tell you I've been running an almost identical setup for over 3 years now. It's fucking functional as fuck.I have no lock screen, so I turn my phone on and I see all this information. All of those app shortcuts has a swipe up action in nova to launch a different (but usually related) app (for example: reddit swipe up opens google plus camera swipe up opens gallery).It's all packed onto a single homescreen.People say it's too busy or too crowded ... I think of it as information dense and highly efficient.the graph weather widget is AIX Weather. The other two weather widgets are 1Weather and Beautiful Widgets.edit: had to remove some personal information from my screenshot :)
I had scrolling lag in third party apps that had to load a lot of data, like Twitter or Instagram.  Scrolling in built-in apps like Settings or the App Drawer were totally smooth.  But my Nexus 6 felt overall 'faster'Until I got root, and used Titanium to kill exactly 152 apps and services!  152!Now it runs like a dream!
Get a better battery app and post a screen shot, what you are showing there makes no sense to me.   Maybe we can help you out.   My Samsung built in battery monitor ( the one you screen shotted) shows cell radio draining most of my battery too,  but as you can see from my screen shots,  is apps and the screen that are my actual drains.   
Another reason I love TMo. I don't think I'll root yet. I really only want it for Xposed and I'd still need a deodexed ROM plus Xposed is still super alpha for 5.1.1.
I bought the [JETech Premium Tempered Glass Screen Protector](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0132XCT0U?psc=1&ampredirect=true&ampref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00) from Amazon. I really like it and fits very well. Quality feels good and it was a nice and quick install. I also have a case on my phone so I feel like it is well protected.
You can only receive the $20gift card if you are purchasing the device using Device Payment or 2yr contract.
When you just swipe a card at your local Walmart, do they normally require you to insert your chip enabled card into the chip reader? I'm assuming the Samsung Pay transaction went through without requiring you to insert that card into the chip reader, right?
Is the Note 5 worth the upgrade from an S4? I have heard some people say that it is disappointing and didn't understand why. What are your opinions?
Would rather battery rather than ram by far. ^
IR blaster :( :( :( :( why Samsung, Why??
I still can't wrap my head around the idea that there are apparently hordes of people jamming their SPens in backwards.
No, just the charger.
If you really like the edges, get it. If they don't appeal to you, or aren't vital to your satisfaction, and you still want all the upgrades and the big screen, then I'm going to suggest getting the Note 5 because, at least everywhere I've looked, it's cheaper. But really, if you want the Edge, get it :) they're both great phones. 
Don't have photos, but yes the shiny metallic end came off at the seam. No bend. I just stuck it in the socket and the next time I took it out only the back part came out along with the spring. I ended up taking it to Verizon and they exchanged it since it's only been three days and it looks to be a manufacturer defect. 
Does anyone have a list,  or a screen shot showing these widgets? 
Not sure how I would go about doing this on a Note 5. edit: Just as some background every other device in my network (be it android or otherwise) remembers my wifi network and I dont have any problems with them. it's just my note 5 that's having issues.
It's a bug with the battery stats, so it's not actually draining 25% of your battery. Even if you fix the bug by disabling WiFi calling and volte, you'll have the same battery drain as you've had (which over all is good).Just use a 3rd party battery app instead.
This uproar is retarded. It's as if I drove my car in 1st gear everywhere and blew my transmission then complained to Volkswagen that it's their fault my car broke. 
I have several but haven't tried that one so no idea.   Bacon reader is easy on battery.   I like slide and now better than bacon but both are more image intensive and hog the battery.   Slide is still in beta but it's very cool. 
Did anyone figure out how to fix the sensor after taking out the s pen?
http://imgur.com/kFVVOZFStock launcher with Black S3 Analog Clock widget
I did a quick google search of LeTV one max and I'm impressed. It's everything the note 5 should have been. Is this phone as legit as it sounds or should we take everything with a grain of salt considering it's from china?
Looks pretty good for a leak since the back of the S-pen looks same as the leaked render of [Note 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxynote5/comments/3duk5m/note_5_supposedly_to_include_with_auto_eject_pen/)
You don't necessarily need a SD card to store movies, and you'll have USB 3 that'll transfer at 5Gb/s. I'm sure battery life will be fine as well. I've talked with Note 4 owners, and they're always bragging about battery life.
What kind of USB connection is that?
Battery needs to do some push ups
Got it. I thought they might be tucking an sd card slot in behind the back... if Samsung really only allows 32gb on this phone they are going to lose their core user base.
I keep skipping the Samsung account login, and am still able to download from their app store without issue.
I've ordered all of these:1. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B010MWHWLA2. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013LKWGU23. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VN6E8KSI usually don't use a case, but I'm hoping to ditch my wallet and use Samsung Pay almost exclusively. But I figure I'll need to throw some emergency cash, emergency debit card, and driver's license into my phone case. If I'm lucky they'll all fit in #2 (#3 looks pretty bulky). If Samsung Pay doesn't work out, I still will use #1 because I've had glass-backed phones before and the glass will crack if I bump my hip into a table with the phone in my pocket. It's unavoidable.
I always thought the IR Blaster was one of the coolest features! 
Only have about 4 hours screen on time, feel like it should be better over 15 hours total 
I was in the same predicament. I got the note 5 because I had a note 4. I barely used the s pen or it's features. So now that I have it and played with it I have a strong urge to check out the Edge + (maybe I'll use all of its features over the note 5). My suggestion play with both of them before you decide which one to get. I have a gear S which can only be linked to one phone at a time without having to reset the watch to connect to another device. So I guess I'll stay with the 5 for a while. 
I just loaded some mp3 onto my note and I'm not getting any cracks or pops.  
That would work for movies, but the OP also mentioned games.
If my note 4 battery is low it will take 3seconds to go to 100% with a removable battery swap. This is why the note 5 sucks. Also no IR blaster or MicroSD.
Long press the back button to get the context menu on the Note 5.
for me personally, I still have to carry wallet for license and passport. so getting rid of 2 or 3 credit cards from my wallet doesn't seem useful. might as well carry them for emergency purposes.what if my phone dies, or that store doesn't take samsung pay. 
C-type is the physical interface type. For example, A (USB port in computer), B (square-ish in printers) do not dictate speed of the interface. Only it's format.  Kind of same if you have 5 different car chassis, but they all use same engine, performance will be very similar.
Long press the back button
Did you download GSAM Battery monitor? I used to get phantom notifications on my HTC One all the time from that app for some reason. Don't know if it still does that.
I posted on your YT video as well, I had a customer come into Best Buy with the same dock and I pulled out the demo Note 5 and it fit in there perfectly. He was stoked about it.  As for MHL the S5 is the last device to support MHL. Everything has gone wirless.  You can buy a Microsoft Display port for the same price as the Samsung MHL dongle and it its wireless. It works with tablets and Windows laptops as well. Unlike the Chromecast which requires WIFI the MS dongle does not need WIFI creates a direct WIFI connection. I personally never liked the MHL dongles as it was a mess of cables and I had to get up every time I want to change movies. The lag in the new devices is so insignificant and the wireless is so convenient. IMHO  
It's such a new tech and until now there are no other phones that have supported it... so right now, no, there isn't another wireless fast charger on the market that I've seen.Though I'm sure we'll start to see some soon.
You have a bug clearly.  Definitely swap it out. 
i remember it said rapid charge on it.   is that also released Friday?   they mentioned it *would* be priced at $40...
There is definitely a difference, but it is far from bigger than the one there is between a note 5 and stock Android, which everyone can agree is more than tolerable. The point is everyone seems to overblow the difference when in reality both suffer from the same pains of TouchWiz (scroll in the Play store in a Samsung device and then in a stock one and watch frames drop like crazy on the Samsung one). Not saying the Note 4 is perfect, but the difference is far from big. Maybe noticeable when side by side with the Note 5, but more than acceptable. And while this is just one small difference, it still is nothing to the damage the Note 5 took with the removable battery and SD card slot. 
now I'm thinking using the s pen was the culprit
Block app installation to the SD card. Simple as that, the cards have no use other than data that doesn't need lightning fast access speeds, like videos, photos, music etc which many of us have a lot of. 
Remove finger print unlock, lock screen to none.
Download the Material Dark theme from the Samsung theme app on your phone 
That would be a bigger let down than no removable battery to me 
You know your carrier probably has a 14-day return policy right? 
I created this post in the hopes that the proper people at Samsung might read this and consider what I believe to be the shared opinions of a very large number of extremely disappointed Samsung customers.First, let me say that I have been a fan of Samsung for a very long time. I am the previous owner of the galaxy S3, galaxy S4, galaxy S5, galaxy note 3, and am the current owner of the galaxy note 4.And it looks like the end of my journey with Samsung will be with the galaxy note 4, I am sad to say.Samsung did 2 things to the Galaxy Note 5, to make this phone unusable for me.No removable battery. I have 2 problems with this. Actually, considering the battery that they put in there is 300mA hours, I guess that actually makes it 3 problems that I have...I'm a heavy user, and there are days that I am using my phone for work and I need to change battery. It's really that simple. I want to be able to walk in, pop the back cover off, pop in a new battery, and be about my way. I don't need to try to remember to take time out to charge during the middle of the day, or carry around some kind of battery pack recharger, or any of the other ridiculous solutions that I suppose Samsung expects me to implement in order to accommodate the fact that they have made the case of this phone sealed.Also, because I am such a heavy user, after about 6 months battery life starts to degrade. And guess what? I want to be able to replace the battery.And no microSD card slot? Really, Samsung??? I honestly cannot believe that you did away with this feature, but there you are, going all iPhone on me! If I would've wanted a dang iPhone, I would've bought one, Samsung! Did you recently hire a bunch of people away from Apple or something??? The galaxy s6 is enough like an iPhone that you really didn't have to ruin the note 5 by making it just a bigger s6...  Why is that a problem for me?  Because my 128 GB microSD card is mostly full, as I use it to house my music library, and many photos.  Hey, Samsung!  I'm not the only one...No, Samsung, I do not want to store my photos on the cloud. No, Samsung, I do not want to stream my music from the cloud, or store my music in the cloud, either. I want them on my microSD card, period. This is a big deal breaker for me as well.I think I understand why you did it... And in all fairness to you, Samsung, I kind of understand.  Kind of...I have read about people using inferior microSD cards that make the phone appear to be performing undesirably, with lagging, errors, etc.  I have also read that cheap microSD cards can actually damage the phones to the point where Samsung has had to replace a significant number of them under warranty, due to no fault of Samsung.And making a sealed case makes manufacturing easier, and improves the ability to waterproof the phones, and saves you money...And I sympathize.  But only to a point, Samsung...  Only to a point...I'm still the consumer.  Like it or not, it's supposed to be about what I want.  I'm not alone, either, and I think you know it.  Charge me more if you have to, but give me what I want.  I'll grumble, but I'll still pay.What you won't get away with is charging me more and taking away core features!There may not be a real contender today, but Nature abhors a vacuum, and so does technology.  There will be a company that will give me what I want...  what Samsung used to provide, but has taken away based on the advice of bean-counters, most likely.I will hold on to my Note 4 until there is a real alternative, and I hope your sales are hit hard enough for you to realize that the consumer is king.  The LG G4 might be my next phone if I get impatient.  You see, Samsung, I like to change my phone every year, and so does my husband.  He's not buying the S6 for the same reasons.  Bring back the microSD and removable battery in the Galaxy Note 6, and I'll come back.  For now, I'm hanging on to my Note 4...  Bad move, Bad move, Samsung.My goal for this post is for others who feel the way I do to chime in.  Maybe together we can get Samsung to come back to their senses...  However, All opinions, whether you agree or disagree on this subject, are welcomed and respected.  Thanks to all.
&gt Wait a couple months when the battery won't hold much charge an your pretty much stuck with thatOr you can just get the battery in the note 5 replaced like a normal person.
i was going by the information available, it's not really a serious statement written in blood. if note 5 comes with a big battery then i won't mind having it non-removable and will somehow live with the fact that it doesn't have SD ([everything's gonna be on cloud/streamable within a few years anyway] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJ-FWG0GRzw)). but if they cut both the card and the battery, and the IR (this one looks pretty certain) then it's gonna be enough to push me to note 4.
This phone is trash. Im just gonna wait for the iphone 6s. Bad battery, sligbt lag at times etc
I have this under lock screen and security: http://i.imgur.com/WtXy1oW.jpgI have T-Mobile though.
From top to bottom we appear to have the Galaxy S6 Edge Plus, the Galaxy Note 5 (with its s-pen peaking out), and an unidentified 8 tablet.
I have neither cable nor dish, but use a chromecast to push content from devices to my television.  We watch netflix and youtube videos on there pretty often, or push pandora to the TV for music.  Its nice to have an IR blaster so you can rig a script to have the TV come on as soon as you hit chromecast and you don't have to find a television remote.
Thank you for your comments much appreciated!As you guessed, my primary reasons for using the microSD card are as follows:1.) I live in the Boonies, so coverage is spotty at best - sometimes dropping down to 3G2.) Even if I had great coverage, I couldn't afford a better data plan. The only thing the works at all out here is Verizon, and they are not cheap.3.) And even if I had great coverage and a good data plan, I'm just paranoid enough to not want to be forced to have someone keep my data for me.(My music library is backed up, and just synchronizes with my phone via Wi-Fi when I walk into the office. Most of the photos are backed up, too, because it is the fact that microSD cards can and eventually will fail. I have had it happen with cheap ones, which I no longer buy.)And for the battery pack versus battery? I don't have to carry either. Because I merely walk into the office, take a fresh battery off the charger, swap it out and go about my way. Again, if I had wanted an iPhone I would've simply bought one.And you are right, again... No one is forcing me to upgrade. But I like to upgrade. I like to upgrade every year. For absolutely no good reason at all, other than I just love new technology. But the note 5 does not feel like new technology to me, quite the reverse... It feels like a couple of major steps backwards.Hopefully you are right, that the note 5 is significantly faster which might be a reason to upgrade. However, most of what I've read so far anyway, says that the difference is imperceptible or at best very small. I would like to see something a little more concrete myself, like a comparison of Antutu benchmark testing.  I know even that is not perfect, but at least it is one of the least subjective ways someone can say this phone or that phone is better or worse.Again, thank you for your comments... Samsung could have made the enhancements and not taken away core functionality. There are a lot of people really angry about this.  I went in to my local cellular providers store today, and of course they had a display of the galaxy S6 and the note 5. After I made my purchase of the new case for my husband, and talked to the salesperson a bit, she told me that the backlash of people unhappy for the very same reasons I am has been absolutely overwhelming. Dozens of people are coming into the store asking her to do the same thing that I did, which is to voice their unhappiness to the Samsung reps.  Although she has no way to prove it, she believes that the backlash is so severe that Samsung will probably have to listen, and bring back removable batteries and the microSD card slot in the next iteration of the note, if not the note and the S series as well. However, that is just an opinion and remains to be seen.Thank you for the heads up on the cases that have microSD card support functionality! I had not heard about that, and that is pretty cool... You know if they gave me a 10,00mA hour battery, I wouldn't whine about the sealed battery compartment either.Again, I appreciate your time and your response.
Just one small logo on the back. Under the camera
Maybe I am missing something but those stats look good. Average life is 12 hours with 7 hours of screen on time? That is very good. &lt10% bettery drain in 1.5 hours is some good stats
It depends on your preference. I owned the original Edge and it's such a beautiful, unique device. I just moved to the Note 5 and I'm pretty happy with it, and this is my first Note device ever.My advice, pick whatever suits your needs. If you prefer a sexier phone and can afford the extra $100, go Edge+. Otherwise, go with the Note. Can't go wrong with either one!
At least there is expandable storage.  I can deal with the battery (battery bank), especially if it has wireless charging without the need for a separate case.3GB of ram is fine on my Note 3, so I'm okay with that.Since I'll be getting the Sprint version, this leak is good news for me.
I read this somewhere (I can't find the source) but TouchWiz isn't even efficient enough for 3GB ram. Apparently, Samsung has to modify the TouchWiz heavily if they want to be efficient with 4GB.
And USB type c.  So a bunch of stuff it won't have :/.
The c-type is fast af tho.
At least the speaker isn't on the back this time!
It's essentially the same as the 7422, but the radio is not built into the chip. Silly CDMA stuff I assume.
There does not appear to be any swiping in my Settings, it's a vertical scrolling menu.Under System, all I have are:Language and Input,Storage,Date and Time,About DeviceIf I go into About Device, I can tap on Battery Info, but it doesn't have the line graph, it just has 5 lines of text information.
I have Google Music but I live in a country with low mobile caps.I'd be paying around $10USD for 4GB, so streaming is not an option unless I'm on wifi.
Thanks everybody! I decided to go with the 32gb as in not a huge power user and I think it's turned out well for me.. After I disabled all the crap from US Cellular and Samsung stuff I don't use it had about 25gb available. 
So much this. The Note was always on the cutting edge (ha), the place Samsung went crazy with features and tech, and that's why I loved it. Shame to see that come to an end and the line to become more design centric.
More internal memory? The base model is the same thing as a Note 4 with 32Gb. 
For use with Google Music
With headphones it sounds great, but the built in speaker is...weird. 
I should've mentioned that I'm on T-Mobile so I don't have VoLTE. Wi-Fi Calling is off as well.
The note 4 Edge was the only useful edge. But if you do plan on getting it, I would suggest downgrading/stayying on kit kat. I hear allot of the edge features were overlooked in the L update. 
Yeah I feel the same. I don't really understand why the Edge+ is more expensive, I feel it should be the other way around. But I'm definitely not complaining, it's saving me like a hundred dollars!
Holy cow I'm so damn excited! Best of both worlds. Plus: a relatively ugly perfectly working note 5 active &gt a damaged (cracked back or screen) note 5. In my opinion at least
Cell reception can cause that, but so can version carriers Voice over LTE, WiFi calling, and other 'advanced calling' features. Try turning those off, and that cell standby should no longer be even in the top 5. 
That blows.  This is on T-mobile in Saint Louis, MO: http://i.imgur.com/VCBX2u5.pngThis is better speeds then my home fiber line. I'm on their $80/month unlimited 4g lte plan.  It is mobile data bliss
Do you think a plastic screen protector will negatively affect S-pen functionality?
did you take that picture with another Note 5?
Serious question. After seeing the Note 5 emphasis on the S Pen, I realized that I'm really mostly on the Note because of the screen size, not the Pen. Now that there's an S6+ Edge, would that be a more fitting device for me? 
I'm going to wait until Xposed for 64bit and 5.1.1 is better established. 
TLDR. Samsung could have opted to change the marketing strategy instead of making it an iPhone clone. 
The quicknote feature actually sounds very useful.  With all of the removed features and negative publicity / discussion surrounding this device, I think Samsung is going to have to wow people in the reveal with software features and S-pen integration.  This quicknote feature, coupled with the ability to add shortcuts to the S-pen menu (evernote for example) may be enough to get some stylus heavy users to bite instead of waiting on the LG G4 Pro (or whatever their stylus phablet will be called.)
My guess is that Samsung is looking for a reason to kill the Note line for the more profitable (cheaper to make) Galaxy S line. To do that they need to have a Note that doesn't sell well. Easiest way to achieve that is to take away everything people have been buying Notes for. A welcome side effect for Samsung is that the people who still buy the Note despite its shortcomings are going to opt for the more expensive 64GB version because the 32GB version has only about 15GB free. 
T-Mobile here, pen was stuck inside and after some fiddling I got it unstuck but the spen detection and the pen itself did not work anymore so I took it in and they exchanged it with me without any hassle. They made sure it wasn't just the spen that didn't work and after about 1mins I walked out with a brand new note5
so you are disappointed that the new Note doesnt have removable battery and no SD Card slot so you consider... another phone with no removable battery and no SD Card. Seems legit.
Are they both on the same carrier? I don't have a Note5 myself but I'm wondering if this might be a signal issue. I'll help to post a screenshot of your battery stats page as well
Does anyone even know what it even gets stuck on? Is it the clicking mechanism that catches on something or what? I haven't even been able to pull it out using a lot of force 
I liked your review. Very sincere and not biased. However, I have to disagree with you in two things: battery life and the email app. Battery life: iOS 8 murdered the iPhone 6. I was an iPhone 6 user until April when I switched to the S6 Edge. Before switcing, I was miserable. Random lockups, freezes, phone running hot and poor battery life which factory resets did not fix for me. Personally, I feel like iOS 8 is very messed up and it was the main reason I ga e up on Apple and made the change. Had the opportunity to upgrade to the Note 5 and this is the best smartphone experience I've had in a while despite my hatred to phones this size. Battery life on my Note 5 lasts me almost 24 hours on a heavy day of emails, texting and phone calls. For example, I'm currently at 39% with 2.5 hours of SOT and 2.5 hours of phone calls since last full charge which was 14 hours ago. In my experience with the iPhone 6, my phone would've died or it'd be close to dying.Email app: I think the Samsung app is very good. Back on iOS, I used the Microsoft Outlook app (formerly known as Accompli ) because of how screwed up the stock app was for me. I use the Samsung email app to connect to an outlook outlook365 account for work and it works great. That doesn't mean it doesn't have things that I wish could be improved, but personally, I feel it's so much better than Apple's. iMessage or FaceTime wasn't enough for me to stay and haven't looked back. Fact is, even my wife just ditched her iPhone for an S6 Edge and she seems pretty happy, specially with the camera which is a beast.Nice review!
Best Buy epically sucks at this pre-order shit.I pre-ordered my Note 4 from Best Buy and a full week after the release date I cancelled my pre-order after looking around other retailers in my area and online and getting one from ATT. Now, that's anecdotal and you might not give it much weight, but what really bothered me was that the employees had absolutely no clue if or when my order would be coming in. Then, when I went to cancel, they couldn't even find my order in the computer (I had e-mail confirmation number, payment receipt, etc). Just remember they are basically little kids that work there. My toddler can scan a barcode and press enter on a keyboard but due to labor laws Best Buy can't hire her.
To my knowledge, not a single leak, render, or anything anywhere has suggested that this device will have an IR blaster.  Really sucks, because this was a feature that although not regularly used, with a lifesaver when I needed it.
Yeah except an external battery is larger, and less efficient due to an extra layer of charging ( battery pack charging the battery).  But even if it was 100% efficient, my 3220mah battery is 55g, a 6000mah quick charge battery pack is 186g, that's almost TWICE (1.8) as heavy, and it's at least twice the volume to carry in your pocket.What's worse is you actually have to keep it plugged in for 90min! (assuming quick charge.) which is a huge hassle I remember from my week trying an iPhone.  Compared to click, boom 100% there's nothing like it. I'm not knocking battery packs for occasional use, but doing that EVERY DAY? Trust me it's enough to consider switching phones. But yeah most people's days are going from their home charger to their car charger to their office desk charger and back again. I get that they don't care. Heck they would do just fine with half the battery life. And if they need to take a battery pack with them the day or two out of the month they need it, it's really not a big deal. But for me, and the small group of people who are heavy users on the go, there's really only one good solution. 
I think I read in a previous thread to turn off VoLTE. Don't remember exactly how but a quick Google search should do the trick 
Thanks for this. I just peeled it off the flash. None on the lens, however. 
My battery life has been pretty great but the cell standby is number one with about 25%. There's gotta be a way to knock that down 
The lens itself may have some plastic on it. There's a tear apart vid on r/android (I'd link but I'm on mobile) 
just bought a glass protector, didnt notice before but i have the halo effect as well. 
welp. thats dissapointing...its the only phone with a stylus, so theres no other options for me. smaller battery, no microsd - whats the point for us 'power users'? im going to hold onto my note 3 until it dies. then after that, samsung youve lost a once loyal customer.
In his defense, it's most likely not an easy task. These definitely aren't made for easy change of battery and I sure wouldn't trust a local shop to do it. So that leaves sending it into Samsung, which is a hassle. Samsung is definitely big enough to set up a clear and easy path for this, for people that have concerns. 
Who were they listening to when they made this phone? I bought the note 3 because of the removeable battery, SD card slot, IR blaster, and the somewhat durable plastic that it's made of.Now instead of a work oriented business phone catered more towards power users, they've turned the Note series into a fuckin iPhone clone with a pen. Will be buying elsewhere for my next device.
I'm looking for one to root and put a custom rom if there's any consensus on ATT LTE
Everybody keep forgetting it's all nice an pretty now... Wait a couple months when the battery won't hold much charge an your pretty much stuck with that... The note 4 can still replace there battery an feel brand new... Hell u can even get an extended 1000battery if u wanted
Samsung Pay w/looppay MST integration, wireless fast charging, better camera, 4gb of ram for faster/efficient multitasking and app switching
What launcher is that? Also can I get those icons without that launcher?
No, because of no microSD card, and no removable battery...  :-)
The Note 5 will hurt when the first version of Android M comes and just like lollipop kills your battery life. You would then have to wait half a year for an update and be looking for plugs on the go in the meantime. With the Note 4 you just swap batteries. 
The biggest difference is the capabilities. The new one can only answer calls and see texts. The window one can control music, s health, launch camera without opening it, and some widgets like flashlight. The clear one is also a magnet for fingerprints and is more slippy. It looks bad ass tho. 
Good. I outgrew rooting I guess. Still do it from time to time on my Nexus 6, but prefer stock. Adblock is the only thing I miss but apps to access forums, etc, don't have ads, so whatever. My Note 5 won't miss it either.
Get the note 4 with a 128gb SD card, the 5 has pretty much the same camera, display and processor so you won't be missing out on much. Edit: I might have mistaken r/galaxynote5 for r/Android but no matter, got to love when people hear what they don't want to hear. Specs &lt actual functionality folks
It seems like a bug. Didn't behave like this on my S6 edge that ran 5.1.1. Here's an app that will work around the problem in the meantime.https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aboutmycode.betteropenwith
Why is a small number of current Note enthusiasts preferable over a wider audience? It seems you announced your disagreement and then argued my point. 
best tw i've seen so far, but i'm using smart launcher. i prefer it on phones and use nova for my tablets.
Removable battery and microSD
I'm a power user and prefer custom AOSP ROMs for my phone. With that in mind I need an external SD card, and that really put me between the Note 5 and LG's G4. I like the G4's camera, but the Note 5 has me with its more powerful SOC and larger AMOLED screen. If the Note 5 comes out with a SD card slot, then I'll snatch it up in an instant, but if it doesn't I've got some serious decision making to do.
Yea i will miss this feature. I got S5 and its pretty helpful to use the IR blaster when i can't find remote.
Loving the look of the curved back - but I wish we could see the edge to confirm it doesn't have an SD card slot just so I can mentally prepare myself.
I'm an android fan, but as a developer of both platforms I feel you completely. Albeit this like everyone said isn't the phone's fault, and not yours either. It's actually one of the problems of Android, in that it gives users and developers so much more power that just as it can do wonders (like tasker, Google it, some people get android just because of that one app), it can also negatively impact performance, something iOS's sandboxed apps can't do which is both a good and bad thing. Either way, glad you are happy with your note, but expect some more issues later on if you aren't careful installing apps. If you don't mind the recommendations, you should install pushbullet, flynx, fx file Explorer, relay for reddit , and nova launcher with moonshine  ASAP as bare essentials to get up and running to enjoy some of the best android can offer :) 
Good point.  Had to be a stray particle of something hard that just happened to end up on your screen. 
Some guy ended up getting 7+ hours of SOT with wifi and constantly playing back a video from 100% to 5%.
I got a Ringke case like the one here, do I also need a screen protector? http://www.giftzr.com/2015/08/note-5-accessories.html
What case do you have for your note 5? I want a rather thick case but don't want it to fuck with the screen protector 
I think it will take some time to get root access on a note 5 unless you have the expertise to do it yourself from scratch. Regarding knox and Samsung pay, who knows what the future will bring, but my guess is that no app will be as closely integrated into knox as pay.  The whole endeavour relies on seamless security.
I think the shiny reflection is hiding the sim slot (I believe it's one of those two holes). And just like the S6, the holes, ports, etc. are aligned along their edge rather than their center. 
Never owned any of the Note series phones, but I'm really interested in the pen capabilities as I've fallen in love with my SurfacePro 3. I use OneNote pretty much all day for everything. Is the Note5 compatible with OneNote, and if so do you or anyone else have any opinions on it running on the Note5? Currently I'm still on Windows 8.1, not upgrading to 1just yet as I've heard it doesn't play well with OneNote. Thanks!
I'm curious if there's a way to slide a thin piece of plastic into the phone alongside the pen to see if the whole pen can be removed in once piece once it is stuck (without breaking either the pen or the sensor), though I'm guessing there isn't clearance for much of anything in there? (I don't have my phone yet)Someone (was it here or on Android Central?) guessed that the sensor sits up inside the phone like this / so that when the pen's clicky-end catches it, it looks like this:/^T If that's correct, and if you could slide something between them, in theory it should be possible to remove the pen fairly easily with no damage. But I'm guessing the fitment is too close and something as thin as paper likely wouldn't be strong enough.I think if I ever hand the phone to anyone I'll just keep the pen with me. I can totally see someone doing this by mistake, if they've never used a Note before.  
This will probably get me down voted into oblivion but I'm gonna say it anyway because it is the truth.  Samsung watched people call their phones laggy for years when the problem was that everyone was storing apps on their SD card.  The SD card memory isn't as fast as internal memory so you get some lag there.  Samsung's bloated UI also contributed heavily (and was probably the bigger contributor) to this problem, but it was untouchable in their eyes.  So in the s6 they improved touchwiz and dropped the SD card...  Both to fix perceptions of lag.  They are successful, but the compromise is loss of SD card.  I would have preferred they scrap touchwiz and went stock Google, but I'm not blind to what they did and why.  I may not buy the note 5, I'm still pondering, but I see what they did and I understand why they did it 
Note 5 has an extra gig of ram and I feel like it has better case options. 
Avoid smart switch.  Look for my other post here on this sub.  Lots of unnecessary drama that could have been avoided by just re downloading all the apps from the play store and manually moving settings etc. For the sd card I would just move it to a pc and transfer the needed contents over usb.
Nothing here. Only issue  I have is some apps seem to load slower than other. The Play Store is one of them. 
I own the Note 4 and a coworker the S6 for comparison. I would have confirmed this a few weeks ago, but the latest 5.1.1 update on the Note 4   puts it on par with the Note 5 in terms of speed quite easily. This applies to the international, sprint and t-mobile variants that got the updates, and for those this is misleading. 
Because you have two and a half hours of wakelocks.
There is a gesture wake up option under settings/Accessibility/Dexterity and interaction/Gesture wake up that will allow you to wake up the device by waving your hand over the sensor.
Yea ive seen that but from what Ive read Verizon doesn't even have VoLTE.
Man that screen flashing is annoying. Only made it a few seconds before stopping the video. 
No IR blaster?.. Wow I use mines eveyday... I won't be getting this garbage... I'll keep my Note 4 for another year or move on to LG
Okay, here's how I analyze that. First of all, Note 3 users who didn't upgrade to the 5 still have the 4 available to them. I don't know that this is a very large group, and I wouldn't count them as a group worth marketing to, frankly. They will buy the 4 when it goes down in price, because they've already revealed themselves to be holding back for some reason from buying the latest and greatest.1. It's pretty clear that Note 4 sales numbers weren't what they wanted. Otherwise, there would have been fewer changes.2. Many Note 4 users would not upgrade immediately, if at all, to a Note 5 regardless. It would be a stretch to claim that even a majority of Note 4 users, a healthy percentage of whom have likely not paid off their device from last year yet, would buy the 5.3. Therefore, only a fraction, even if a somewhat sizable one, of current Note 4 users are going to jump at a Note 5 and buy it at launch.4. Therefore, catering the device to this audience is silly.5. Therefore, the audience for this device should not be that audience. They're looking for iPhone converts, people still using the S4 or S5, and so on who have not yet bought a big phone.You're marketing to a fraction of a fraction. That simply doesn't make business sense. I'm a happy Note 4 user, and I get your argument from that personal perspective, but it is pure nonsense looking at it from the perspective of Samsung.They are going to find out with this device if taking away the IR blaster, removable battery, and SD card make a difference in sales. If they do, they'll assess that decision and move forward. If it doesn't, then you'll have to be more comfortable with the fact that users like you and I don't drive phone design for flagships, and likely shouldn't, to be frank.We're an odd bunch. A company that caters to our desires would be rewarded, but not enough to justify catering their design choices overall to our specifications.Someone will make our phone, Samsung tried, and it apparently wasn't performing as well as they needed it to. Perhaps it's because that feature set is not valued by the market. I'm sorry if this upsets you.
Hopefully with sd card support. 
its a camera mode
Hit up their chat support!  Someone in the Verizon subreddit posted a screen cap so I had the same convo.
Granted the only samsung I've had was a tablet.... I've NEVER used a case or screen protector in my life.  For 12 years kept every phone for two years.  Never had this issue
Uh ok well go and get your friends note 4 and press the recent apps button and tell me the speed is similar. In addition the note 5 opens apps faster than any phone on the market at the moment. I loved my note 4 but the note 5 is noticeably superior performance wise. 
My note doesn't have any effects to speak of unless you have headphones plugged in.  Only then can you enable them.  Am I missing something? 
That's a very good point that I had forgotten about.  Thanks for reminding me, and I agree, I can see the point of that.  However, I am still baffled at the fact that they are not offering a 128GB model, and am wondering why they chose not to do so.  Perhaps the 128GB S6/S6E did not sell particularly well?  Still, I think N5/S6E+ users would have more benefit, and prefer, the higher capacity devices, so I wish they would have given them the 128GB treatment like they did the S6/S6E.  I'm still pondering as you are.  Currently I have a 128GB S6, which I do love, and personally, I am not bothered by the lack of a removable battery, but I am already using around 75GB's of the storage, so the drop to only 64GB's, which would more likely be about ~50GB's usable, would kind of suck.Also, the lack of an IR Sensor, is a bit of a letdown, even though I barely use it, so it's probably something I could do without.
I'm saying in response to the article.There was no need for an aesthetic change, the criticism for the design factor wasn't nearly as strong as it was for the S devices. 
Already did they're all the same except the basic which was much worse and had a more yellow tone on whites. I'm really not sure if I'm just being ocd or if amoled screen are supposed to be like that.
The black is definitely blue - ish, especially in bright light.  I had a white phone prior, so went with black to mix it up.  I like it, its a beautiful black/blue color- but it does show fingerprints like crazy.  Personally I would have gotten the titanium silver if it was available.
I've got lightning launcher and love it. 
I just got mine today didn't know about this promo would love to have some Netflix. 
Unroot and it will work unless you tripped Knox.
What launcher, what icon pack, and what are the three buttons at the bottom.  This is very attractive!  
Don't waste your time and battery on it.  You don't need it unless you're installing less than reputable apps anyway. 
I can definitely tell what you're talking about but I don't think it's enough to make me dislike the Edge + display. You can only notice the difference when you look at the screen very closely. Anyway, good point!
They haven't given me beta yet because they suck horse balls .... but I'm as excited as you. It really should work anywhere you can swipe your card. Just keep things like ATMS and restaurants in your mindyou'll still need a physical card.
The phone MUST be a postpaid one, no prepaid phones. And obviously must turn on and not have a cracked screen. See if anyone has a working, but unused iPhone 3G or something similar from that era. 
U wot M8? I have a Nexus 6 and Note 5 right here on my desk. I go outside on this sunny Monday. I can only see one of the screens. Guess which one it is?The Nexus 6 is old OLED tech. Consumes way too much power, burns-in fast and is dimmer than night in sunlight. Powerhouse is right in that it drains the huge battery so fast, but that's about it.
As someone who has had every note variation on the release date, this will be the one I will not own.  I'm very disappointed with the lack of removable battery and sd card slot. That is what has kept me with Samsung over the years.  I currently have over 8gb used on my external sd card in my phone, and don't plan on deleting anything and spending money to not have any memory on my phone. 
I did some research and I think I made a mistake...it was actually the desktop charging dock and not the multimedia dock. I thought it was really weird that it would fit into this customer's and not your's. After getting on Amazon and looking closely at the photos of the two I am sure his was the desktop dock. Sorry to get your hopes up...
I hate AT&ampT as much as the next guy, but I wouldn't go so far as to calling that spyware. 
The small battery is annoying, but I'm glad the SD card is gone.
I hope some of these aren't true. No additional storage? That's a huge disservice to their brand as an iPhone alternative. I use my note 3 a lot to draw/paint for my job, .psd files get pretty hefty... I guess I could look into cloud storage? Seems like another thing I'd have to pay for.....Shame, if these are true I think I'll have to part ways and look for an alternative.
It fell out of my pocket into my car. When it hit the ground it cracked
I know many people don't talk about the Note 4 edge, but I am currently looking at getting either the note 4 edge or the note 5. Anyone have experience with the edge?
I just put on the JETech and I love it. Yes it does seem small, but like you said, is because of the curved glass. Centered up, there is a tiny bit of halo if you really look for it at the right angle, just a single column of pixels on the very edge of the screen. I think with true perfect precision placement, I could eliminate that, but I have to look for it to even notice, so it doesn't bother me.But I haven't bought a screen protector since the note 2 came out, and this one really impressed me, I really like the tempered glass after never having used it before.
I'm a fan of both platforms and I think you misunderstood him and most of your arguments have nothing to do with the real problem. The Note 5 has some killer battery life, yes, but unlike iOS, Android apps can have much larger system wide effects like reduced battery life (cough, Facebook, cough ). This is not his fault, but an android pitfal of giving the user and developer too much power. I'm a power user, but I recognize even android isn't for everyone.. Also, Samsung's apps are hideous and and hard to use no matter how you put it. I'm an ux developer so I should know. If there is something iOS always gets right is ux. 
I just ordered for in-store pickup. Shows available. Used a 10% movers coupon as well (full device purchase). Lol.
Also, I would still not use an AV even if I installed third party apps not from the play store. This is because even if they are third party, I only install apps that other users have reported safe and issue free, such as xposed framework, Adaway, and Lucky Patcher. 
This conflicts directly with the most recent rumors of there only being a 32gb option with a MicroSD card slot on board...
rinke fusion case on amazon is awesome and comes with a screen protector that is top notch, no halo.apparently they noticed haloing on the back of the phone from the case and included a back screen to combat it
That's weird, because I got a Verizon S6 Edge + and it came with ear buds. You would think that they would include them in the Note 5, too.
For those switching to a different launcher, be sure to remove all of the widgets running in the stock TouchWiz launcher. At least in the past versions of Android, the widgets still run on the stock launcher even if it's not the default.
Seems to be same for me.  I've just unplugged from the phones first full over-night charge.  I went from 100% to 93% in a half hour.  I have wifi on and data.  Auto screen brightness and nothing else should be sucking power.  Yet, here we are. 
UPDATE: I was able to pick up a white 64gb Note 5 today at a local T-Mobile store in Paramus.
Exactly! that's why I bought the Note 2 when it launched and now I have the Note 4. And I love it. It has features a lot of other phones with big screen lacks. Now it seems to be following companies instead of innovating. Anyways thanks for the info about the Note 5.
I'd say get the Note 5 unless having the IR Blaster is a big concern for you. Other than that it's sounds like you're fine with the other changes they've made.
When you signed in, it gave you options of things to synch (calendar, contacts, etc). I just removed my account and logged in again and unchecked Messages that did it for me. If that doesn't make sense let me know! 
and definitely no stereo speakers
This is not to rationalize the lack of external storage. But what I do is use a USB OTG cable and hook it up to my phone, then hook that up to a thumb drive. I kind of like this better to be honest... Never have to worry about a bad SD card. 
That's a total change of direction for the line though.  The note was always the premium hardware.  The 4gb seems all but confirmed, I'm hopeful we see a 410battery too.
Brightness level? 
Tap and go is google account only, so everything that is in your google account will show up. Smart switch is for sms, non-google contacts, and the bulk of your local data, pics, videos, music. I think it does sideloaded apps too.Then I use ES file explorer for everything smart switch doesnt get, which is anything outside of the common folders.
Thanks. I was worried about the buttons not being repsonsive. I amight also not like the bump. Going to give the Caseology case a shot.
I'm surprised, but not surprised at the Youtube comments.  This is such an easy mistake to make, but people insist that the 'idiots' this has happened to are to blame.  This should have come up in product testing and the fact that it's THAT easy to break the mechanism in such an innocent manner is definitely a problem.As a Note 4 owner, I've inserted my stylus back into my phone countless times without looking.  On the rare occasion that I accidentally tried to put it in backwards, I was unable to, because that end of the pen doesn't fit.  A quick flip in my hand and the stylus is back safely in it's home.This isn't about Samsung 'hate'.  This is a design flaw and one that is going to lead to a lot of damaged Note 5 phones.
#PenGate
Careful of those, I don't think the S6 and Note 5 etc. support MHL. There are comments on the Samsung product that it doesn't work with the S6 (and I would assume the same goes for the Note 5).Edit to indicate maybe the Note 5 does support MHL. I've seen conflicting information so far but someone report back if it works.
&gt I can pay ??20more for 128gb. I can get over the ir blaster. But a single battery? That's a lifestyle change.Or you could just get an external battery that isn't a whole lot bigger than the note 4's battery and go on with your life.  It's not that big a deal.&gt It's like having an 8mile range electric car as your only car. Yah, it's totally the same thing, if you could also have a spare battery that'll let you go another 16miles and it was small enough to keep in your pocket.
My god what are you doing with Bluetooth 
Being able to doodle on screenshots is one of my favorite things about the Note series. :)
You could enable it using Nova Launcher (unlocking it via a shortcut) on the AT&ampT Note 4. May try on my Note 5.
U think there is a fix if the sensor is bad?  Do u think there is a way to make it detect when the spen is pulled out cause without that screen write with the phone off wont work. 
ohh...that sucks, anyways i'll probably just use headphones with it.
I have the note 3 now and have been waiting for the note 5 to come out. Note 4 didn't seem much of an upgrade from the 3 and because of my Verizon edge program timing I thought I'd just wait for the gn5..... well shit.... I don't like down grade in battery life and no SD slot.  Should I just get the note 4 guys? This is seriously depressing.
Is the ir blaster really gone? 
3GB Ram? I thought it would go on with 4GB with previous leaks.
Wait until the phone is released if you can. I needed one ASAP so I already bought one, but once the phone is out, you should be able to get more official cases that are guaranteed. Right now, I feel like it's hard to know since nobody can test it with their phone yet. 
I have the Neo Hybrid and I like it.My review here isn't gonna be that great because I usually don't use a case at all (but you are wise to use a case on the Note 5 with it's 100% guaranteed to shatter to bits glass back), but here are my thoughts on the Neo HybridWhat I like:* Feels pretty good in the hand (texture, size)* Buttons work well* Ports work well (s-pen, usb)What I don't like:* I don't like the bump/ridge all around the outside. Understand that you WANT this bump/ridge to help protect the screen, but I really don't like it. I'm constantly aware of it when interacting with the edges of the front of the device (hitting home, task switcher, back, anything near the left/right of the screen). This is one of the reasons I never use a case to begin with.* It's a bit difficult to put on - BUT since there's no removable battery and no SD card you shouldn't have to take it off very often (maybe to clean your device). The rubber/TPU part is easy to put on of course, but the plastic ring around the outside is not flexible at all and is a tight/perfect fit, so putting it on is stressful because it feels like you might break it if you pull on it too hard, but at the same time, it just doesn't want to go on. It goes on, you'll be fine, but it's a little tight.
I don't think mine is playing in 60fps when available either.  I'll test more and report back. 
It's 2x1 for me too, I just changed the layout of icons to 5x4
I wonder if they had their phones on the charger while doing so. As far as the battery goes, so far, so good... It's only been off the charger for a few hours now. I'll give it a few days before any conclusions. Loving this phone overall , hope that you feel the same! 
If you want to be sure on the wired one you could get the one Samsung sells. It does support higher resolution than the cheep one.  http://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/cell-phones-accessories/EE-HN910FWESTAI have not noticed much delay in the wireless one, but I have not really played games over it. 
&gt Or are you saying you could replace the Note 5's battery for 5dollars?Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.  It currently costs $5to replace the battery on a galaxy s6, or an iphone 6.  When shops start doing it later this year, the note 5 will cost the same.
That's strange. I installed it a few days ago on my PC with Windows 1and haven't had any issues. It did have an update to version 4.as soon as installation was complete though. 
Have you tried just opening the Samsung Pay app? I never got a formal email but I opened up the app after applying for the beta and I was able to set everything up just fine.
This is my main concern with upgrading to the phone right now. I know the Note 4 has the RAM but it's either running out from a software bug or killing background apps unnecessarily.
I auto  activated just fine.   So far it is very smooth, I'm running the Samsung switch app right now and transferring several gb of apps, pics,  and video over from my old s4 right now and it's browsing pic heavy subreddits at the same time. So that's good.  The phone is almost so thin that it detracts from your ability to grip it but it's not that slippery.   The spen is crazy accurate for clicking on tiny stuff, like at&ampt's awful menus.   Note 4 people may be used to that. I've been using a custom launcher and keyboard for so long I forgot how much stupid noise touch wiz makes.
it's all stock, although the launcher is Nova Launcher
Hello /u/menarutofan. We are happy that you posted on /r/GalaxyNote5, while we support all types of discussion including blog posts, we do not support posts only for self advertisement. It is pretty clear that you are posting this from a new account and THIS is your ONLY post. Also the video isn't made by you, so you could have just linked the video to this post. Please use your main account next time. Thank you.
Maybe the 2016 Note will have no S-Pen :)
I have the S5 and I just want something bigger and more powerful. My battery life sucks and everything is slow, no matter how many times I clear my RAM and uninstall apps. Simply, I want more space to do more things in a shorter amount of time, and it seems to do the trick. I could get a Note 4 because it has all those things, plus the remov. battery and SD but it's stupid to buy a phone when the newer, better* version is coming out in less than a month. I could also get the iPhone 6 or 6s Plus, but by comparing the (albeit rumored) specs of the N5 and the iPhone 6 plus, there's really nothing that appeals to me more from the apple side. edit: *arguably better, I suppose.
I'm coming from an S4, but so far it's amazing. Great camera too
Thanks for the heads up on the beta program. Just signed up. Samsung Pay is the feature that made me insta-buy the Note 5 despite the epic anti-Note5 circlejerk on /r/android (holy shit they are being fucking idiots over there).Can't wait to try it!
its in display settings for me (att)
I think usb-c doesn't yet support fast charging
Assuming you don't need the SD card slot or expect to switch phones within a year, Note 5 but by a tiny amount, so much it's not worth the extra $20usd imo, unless you are reaaaally into the glass design. Don't be misleaded by comments calling the Note 4 slow, since most of them probably haven't got the 5.1.1 update that hit Sprint and T-mobile owners which drastically improved ram performance and response time, putting it almost on stock Android levels. (although if you are on AT&ampT or Verizon on the 5.0.x update , then it's slow, like Moto E slow, or maybe worse). Personally I'm really enjoying my pre-owned Note 4,  which despite having quite a lot of usage, I just swaped the old battery for a new one and suddenly battery life is like it was brand new, something I wouldn't have been able on the Note 5. I'm even making plans to buy the anker third party 6400mah battery that's available for the Note 4,  which even if it ads a bit of bulk, seems amazing for doubling the already glorious battery life. I have to admit tough, I got mine a month ago while it was on the 5.0.x update and within a week I was already making plans to sell it back and get a Note 5 because of how incredibly slow and buggy it was, but with the latest update I'm now sure this phone will last at least 2 years before I feel the huge need to update. 
I have the Xiaomi 520mAh charger.  I keep it in my car or backpack.  It can charge my Note 4 when it's off to about 100%.  And to about 70% when it's on.  I only use it about once every 2 months or so, but it has come in super handy the rare times I forget to bring my spare battery.With that said, it's ridiculous that you have to carry something (at all times now) about 5-6 times the size of a spare battery, for one recharge.
how is the health of your Note 4 battery? mine have really taken a hit after a year. I am looking to replace them. If you are experiencing the same, aren't you worried about the state of your phone next year? you'll pretty much be stuck with a Note 5 with a ran down battery. 
Are you all putting the clicking side of the S pen in the hole? ... 
My battery drained fairly quickly the first few days. After about a week, my battery is lasting much longer than it did during the first 2-3 days.
If you read a lot of comics, I recommend the Note 4 because of the expandable storage. I'm also an avid comic reader (and download a lot of high quality via torrents) and the 128gb sd card did the trick. Also, if you plan on keeping the phone for 5 years expect shortened battery life within 6-9 months of usage (quick charging kills the battery quicker), so you will need to pay for both a new battery, and pay to a phone repair service to replace it since the back is sealed in on both the Galaxy S6 and Note 5 (and hope they remove the back without damaging it). Samsung offers replacing the battery via warranty for the first year, but that's a short time compared to your expected 5 years. If you really want the phone to last, I'd go for either a Note 4, or S5 since both devices have removable batteries, pretty much the same camera from the S6/Note 5 (with slightly less wide less but just as great camera quality), and the display quality.My friend still owns his Note 2 and has replaced the removable battery for a new one several times and he is still extremely happy.**edit**: downvoted for stating the facts, truth hurts don't it?
Honestly I couldn't care less about the battery or the SD card, but I would have appreciated a LARGER battery.  Even 3500mah would have been nice.
Assuming they fix their TouchWiz, we can only hope for better battery life from their software side.
Is there really any real advantage over micro USB?
How you got free Netflix 
Please let use know how the battery holds up after moderate usage. Of course after you have more time with it. 
Headphones sound really really good. 
True, which is exactly why I never use Google Wallet.But, if Samsung Pay works as advertised, I could load all of my credit cards, gift cards, and store membership cards onto my phone and just leave them all at home. Which means it might be possible to either have a very thin wallet or no wallet at all.
Nope, it doesn't stick right and it's slightly too narrow so that you get diffraction at the edge of the screen.http://imgur.com/a/cIBhp
I mean just go and check your my apps to see if a youtube app update is waiting.  Mine was ready to update, but never alerted me to it. 
You may be able to go in and preorder through your Verizon store after the announcement.  I plan to do that at AT&ampT.  I'm also upgrading from a galaxy S4 that has served its time well.
Lol People are complaining about their worn out batteries on their note 4's already. Give it 1months and I'm going to laugh at the kids that can't replace their battery that's worn out from Quick Charging. Oh Samsung is going to patch it? Sorry only available on the note 6 TOPKEK
Seeing that you are using a custom ROM, do you use the S-Pen anymore? I use CM11 on my s3 and I have no problem there, but I feel that putting a custom ROM on a Note 4 would remove a major selling point of the phone. What do you think?
The phone's calibration will be off and will shut itself off when it thinks it still has 20% battery life left.
I think the case you are referring to is the Samsung Protective Cover. Picked up a pair for my wife and myself at a local T-Mobile store last week. http://www.t-mobile.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-note5-protective-cover-clear-silver.html
Haha... yea, I couldn't figure out why my heartbeat sensor wouldn't work. Then, I found the film.
I had an issue with crappy battery life too. Normally I would just root and use wakelock detector, greenify and Amplify but for some reason I want to leave my Note 5 as stock as possible. If you're like me check out Package Disabler Pro. It'll let you freeze applications just like titanium backup on root. If you freeze a couple of packages then, at least in my experience, the battery life will be much better. Stuff like fingerprint, unused google services, Samsung push service, knox, enterprise crap all run in the background and keep your phone awake. 
It's hard to say without having tried it. But the difference from the Note 5 dpi to Note 4 shouldn't break anything as it's not that huge of a difference. 
&gt Yeah I don't really understand Samsung thinking.I know what they're thinking.  The vast majority of users never take the battery out of the phone, and they just leave the SD card in there permanently, so would be better served by the phone simply having more internal memory.
Okay, looks like no one else here has messed with the dpi. I found a thread on xda for the S6 having the same issue. Basically, you need to freeze or disable the theme centre, otherwise you can't turn your phone to landscape mode. For now, I think I will just stick with a portrait-only phone. At least until we get root. 
I wouldn't count on it. There's note 5 accessories specifically,stick to those.
You missed: https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxynote4/comments/3iquld/video_note_4_running_the_tw_511_update_answering/ That's running the latest 5.1.1 firmware which I'm running right now. I fail to see a speed difference opening recents. I've even ran CyanogenMod on my Note 4 which in truth utterly destroys even the Note 5 in speed of course (stock android, duh), but this latest update finally matches it. Heck, even the Note 5 has the ocassional framedrop in the recents panel (Don't lie, we all watched reviews and the fps drop was there, dropping to about 25ish frames, you can thank touchwiz never matching stock android for that)Also, the only apps the Note 5/S6 open faster than any phone on the market are the stock apps, which obviously have performance enhancements on Samsung's hardware, however non-stock apps open just like in other devices. That noticeably superior was only true for pre 5.1.1 firmware.Source: Owned an Xperia Z1 and Moto X2, both near-stock android devices.
I enrolled, and got accepted. But I'm not getting any update on the app or anything.
Does it actually cover edge-to-edge on the front glass? It seems like it probably stops a mm or so before the edge (like right where the curve is).
I got White Pearl. I had a white S5 and I just love how clean white phones look. I love it and it doesn't show fingerprints as bad as the other colors imo :) either way it's a beautiful phone. 
By default it chimes notifications whenever open Wi-Fi connections are in range. It's possible you're on the edge of a neighbor's range? 
My debit card has worked fine since the beginning of time and will continue to work in the world of Samsung Pay.Yes, it's about tech advances and convenience. It's also not that special. Pulling out my wallet is second nature and so easy. I love NFC and tech, but this is a silly reason to spend a grand on a new phone unless you have other reasons. I use Google Wallet for french fries and such and, well, it's neat?I got accepted into the beta for Samsung Pay. Too bad I already returned the Note 5 to Best Buy.
What I'm concerns is with the partners at launch.  For instance,  on 09/28 when it launches,  will I be able to link my Chase card to Samsung pay? Or will it launch with only a few compatible card issuers? 
Yeah I got a wallet case for it immediately. It's pretty snazzy. It still feels smaller than my G3 did with an Otterbox Defender on it.
Thanks for the gold! It's not an often used feature (if I recall correctly T-mobile is the only carrier that allows it in the states), and they changed the icon slightly from the 4. I actually had to switch it on for a second on my Note 5 to make sure that's what it was. 
definitely not - although there ought to be given it's an amoled display and they could do very low power notifications.
I am using it! I tried it out on a card reader (no NFC) at Walmart and it worked as if I swiped a card. Bad ass.
Found that from Update 2 on this link http://www.engadget.com/2015/08/13/samsung-galaxy-note-5-hands-on-preview/
Should've at least put a bigger battery in there. Period.
I have the s6 edge right now, it's a beautiful device but will be upgrading to the note 5. the edges look awesome, but that's about it. If I have to chose from the spen and the edges, I would go with the spen. 
Call Chase and ask. The process of provisioning is the same as Apple Pay, so I think most cards that support AP will support Samsung Pay out of the box. The credit unions will come a bit later from what I understand and Discover will come in 2016. Samsung is not charging fees like Apple is, so the banks are more enthusiastic about signing on with SP.
I'm having battery drain issues on my T-Mobile Note 5.
Yeah the built in speaker is like a robotic tinny something. Cant put my finger on it but its annoying. The headphone jack is money though. Sounds fantastic. Even on the tube amp setting. Obviously its just processing but sounds great. 
I'm upgrading from 4 to 5. The only thing I'm  really excited about is Samsung pay ... apparently you can hold your phone next to an old fashioned magnetic card reader and trick it into thinking you swiped a physical card. 
And have the glass back ruined like every normal repair does? No thanks. I owned a Z1 and I know what happens when you remove a glass back for repairs.
You can see from the image that I had 5.5 hours screen on time - probably would have topped 6 hours if I had burned through that last 15%.  I'm going to continue to monitor but I'm not disappointed with the battery so far.  I do think there is a little too much screen off, phone active time though, not sure what is causing that.  
I've just been pressing the home button with the stylus.. doesn't take much effort and works fine.
Just started using it today. It's working great...used it at the grocery store, a department store, McDonald's with no problem. Now I just need more money so I can keep using it..
You are right, I'm using Action Launcher 3 right now but Touchwhiz really isn't that bad this time around, and the theme store is actually pretty cool.
If your main use case is media consumption (and I assume video) then I'd recommend staying away from the Edge variants -- video has some weirdness at the curved edges of the screen and it took away from the experience for me.
&gt Nexus devices have removable batteries and SD slots.They absolutely do not.
Damn nice tip, any idea how long there giving that out? My upgrade is next month.
As someone who  has always loved every feature of their Note, but never used the IR blaster, I'm curious. Why do so many people love it so much? What do you do with it?
Whoops, my mistake. I think I heard a rumor that the new one might sport an SD slot.

My phone goes to sleep and continues charging so something isn't right with his phone or charger. 
I'm amazed at the level of hate being thrown at people with this problem.  It's such an easy mistake to make, especially if you're in a hurry.  It's not like these people are forcing the pen in and THEN complaining.  If that were the case, I'd support your comment.As a Note 4 owner, I've placed my stylus back in the phone without looking many times and a handful of times I've realized (without looking) that I was putting it in backwards, because it simply wouldn't go in.  A quick flip in my hand and it was in the correct way.A mistake this simple shouldn't result in permanent damage to the phone.  This SHOULD have come up in their testing.  It's also a very simple problem to avoid.  A slightly larger end of the pen (like they have had in all previous Notes) would have avoided this entirely.From a product testing point of view, this is pretty unforgivable.
I've used both samsung keyboard and swype and saw no lag - haven't even opened the stock messaging app.  I'm on AT&ampT
Long pressing brings up multi window not the context menu
I'm guessing you don't have a Samsung smart tv? I use my Note 4 to directly screen mirror on it. It's under network settings on the TV.
Dammit.  I'm apparently stupid enough.  Just like when a waitress says hot plate and you gotta touch it, I was curious how the pen could get stuck so I slid it in backwards very slowly.  Guys, the pen doesn't gradually get stuck.  The top gets caught on something inside very suddenly.  I had to pull the pen out hard, and yep....write with screen off no longer works.  Wow, I just activated this thing about 2 hours ago.  :(****DON'T EVEN TRY TO PUT THE PEN IN BACKWARDS SLOWLY****
You just went to the website and submitted your email and they the pay app was able to be installed from the stub app? Or did you get an email saying you were in the beta?
I would have more sympathy if the claims they made weren't just so utterly silly.  It's stuff like I go camping for 4 days and there's no room anywhere in my pack for a powerbank!  And while I'm out there in my tent, I have to have my 100gbs of music!And then you poke them some more and you find out they're still using a note 2 anyway, so they weren't even going to upgrade to a 5 in the first place. They just want to bitch.
However much battery life may be better Li Ion batteries degrade over time nessitating replacement.  NOT a problem on the Note 4
Mine had tape on the box. I would be too worried as long as all the packaging in the box was all untampered with. Maybe they just mixed a box on the tape belt. 
I am glad I saw this. I use the IR blaster all the time. That's a huge blow. This makes me disappointed. I'll admit Samsung Pay was an advantage. 
I would honestly go with the note 5 it's much more practical and imo looks better when you're watching movies or youtube videos. I would suggest you go and take a look at the note 5 in store and see it for yourself. 
I just roll my eyes at the power user label too.  It seems to mean someone who carries 80gb of music he's never listened to and a bunch of movies because he's too cheap to use the cloud. Oh, and he hasn't bought a new phone since 2012 but he's still angry Samsung isn't catering to him anyway.For bonus laughs, most of them seem to believe you have to throw the phone away when the battery wears out instead of just getting it replaced.
Some say the Note 6 has no battery at all - it's that good!
I too, am impressed with the LeTV Max as I indicated earlier (Pls note that the LeTV One Pro is a different phone). The Max goes up to 128gb, is 8-core, 4gb RAM, 340mAh battery, 21mp Camera, Has user select-able color profiles for display, 4K video with a Sony IMX230. The only things that give me pause are 1) It's size: 6.33 inches. It's called a Superphone (and rightly so, lol). 2) Updates. I am concerned about updates unless I root and keep it updated myself, which I normally do...But, I also follow a community that keeps certain flagship phones updated. My current Note 2 is running a Note 4 ROM. The Note has an active community. The Max? It remains to be seen. Since it is carrier unlocked and not from these shores, Yes...I am concerned about updates to the OS. 3) The Snapdragon 81is said by some, to have had overheating issues. We'll see how this plays out over time.  *** Why I'm NOT concerned about The Max coming from China. The build quality is said to be excellent and most phones today either come from China or Korea and even then, some of the manufacturing is done in China...Even the beloved apple phone is assembled in China!On the upside, I am seeing this phone for as low as $60USD online. LeTV reportedly wants to stick it to overpriced stateside manufacturers by putting a powerhouse into the mix at a reasonable price. I'm game!
Go launcher, flatty icon pack, and it's my dialer, app drawer, and text messages at the bottom from left to right. Thanks for the appreciation
